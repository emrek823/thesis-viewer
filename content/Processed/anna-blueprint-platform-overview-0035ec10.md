Blueprint Platform

ANNA Blueprint Platform Overview

# Executive Summary

ANNA opened its first center in Sudbury, Massachusetts in February 2024, and within four months, the center reached profitability, achieving a ~185x ROI on initial investment and generating over $1 million in annualized profit in its first year. ANNA repeated and improved this trajectory, opening a second center in Wayland, Massachusetts and growing from $0 to $1.6 million in annualized revenue in just 6-months, proving out the repeatable multi-site playbook. We’ve rapidly accelerated growth, leveraging AI for scalability and margin expansion–improving margin profile by ~60% to ~40% EBITDA margins and a comprehensive set of playbooks on multi-site expansion to repeatedly build, recruit, drive referral volume, and deliver high quality clinical services at scale.

We’re compounding this center-level growth with market-level growth, planning to open up 180 locations within 5 years across 12 states, representing ~$1.02 billion in annual recurring revenue. Applying an EBITDA margin of 40%, this represents ~$406 million in Pro Forma EBITDA which, at a 20x EV/EBITDA multiple, is ~$8.1+ billion in enterprise value.

VISION: To institutionalize our proven AI clinical and operational products, scalable playbooks, and people strategies underpinning the existing ANNA business model in order to scale an AI-enabled multi-specialty platform known as Blueprint Health.

At Blueprint, we are vertically integrating AI into care delivery to create a novel platform that brings together key components that have been validated in isolation to-date. First the automation of operational processes like scheduling and revenue cycle management created significant expansions in operating profit margins and cash flow yields. Second, the investment into clinical AI infrastructure such as treatment plan automation and AI fidelity both 1) Dramatically expands provider-level and therefore unit-level profitability, leveraging the operating leverage inherent in the provider economics to drive margin with greater revenue per clinician and 2) Creates the foundation to deliver superior clinical care at scale through a reinforcing clinical stack.

Blueprint scales the highly compelling de novo healthcare services business model across adjacent specialties by creating and leveraging a centralized platform for the creation of category-defining AI-enabled healthcare services business. The three key pillars to effectively implement this platform are 1) People, 2) Playbooks, and 3) Product.

People: The people model creates pods of Investors-in-Residence (IIRs), CEOs-in-Training (CITs), and Forward-Deployed Engineers (FDEs) to create the initial company concepts and leverage the centralized AI products to build advantaged business models.

Playbooks: The playbooks model leverages competencies across the many vectors of success for healthcare services companies: market selection, payor contracting, business development, and revenue cycle management to name a few.

Product: The product is the centralized infrastructure built across the various operational and clinical workflows to significantly improve margins, scalability, and quality of care.

There are a few key principles that highlight the tremendous value of this model:

Owner of residual value from software vs. being a vendor. Software vendors only capture what operators are willing to pay above commodity alternatives or their own cost of replication; with AI development largely “wrapping core LLMs,” replacement / insourcing costs are falling, compressing license pricing power. Vertical operators capture the full delta in margin expansion and the multiple on that cash flow

For instance, an AI agent that responds to intakes 24/7 and integrates into an EMR with automated reminders may drive a ~10% improvement in top-line growth. For a $100mm top-line company at a 40% EBITDA margin, this is an incremental $4mm in EBITDA and $80mm in enterprise value; however, the agent likely isn’t pricing into the EBITDA improvement much less the enterprise value improvement. The reason is 1) According to Elion there are currently 54 companies doing the same and 2) The cost to build a competing agent internally is 4-months of engineering time. Indeed, Clarion Health charges ~$5,000 / month for this service.

Build vs. buy arbitrage. Others pay 10–15x to acquire 20% margin assets; we build de novos at a fraction of that basis (e.g., ~$58k to breakeven; >$1M annualized profit in year one). The enterprise value uplift from AI-driven margins compounds at the HoldCo, not in a third-party software vendor’s ARR.

To quantify, if a company with a single location is generating $1mm in EBITDA, it would likely sell for $5 - 8 million to an acquirer. To build that same location, it costs ~$100K. In effect, the builder is creating $5 - 8 million in value with $100K of investment; or put differently, the builder can build 50 - 80 locations with the same amount of capital. Note, M&A GTM speed contingent on deal availability, sourcing capacity, deal negotiation, diligence, closing, and integration.

Moment in time. Opportunities and paradigm shifts come around infrequently and we have to take advantage. Similar to the race in accounting, call centers, and other areas across tech, there is a moment in time to capture this opportunity before others and become the de-facto leader and platform for AI-enabled care delivery. We need to monopolize talent, capital, and market opportunities across the most valuable specialties.

The category creation opportunity as a result of paradigm shifting market dislocations is well established. 1) U.S. Steel capitalized on the US Industrial Revolution to develop the Bessemer Process to more effectively produce and sell steel, 2) General Motors capitalized on mass consumer adoption of automobiles to create the first modern multidivisional corporate structure across their house of brands, 3) Microsoft leveraged the rise of personal computers to build and own the operating system. The next generational companies are being built on the paradigm shift to AI, and a multi-specialty AI-enabled healthcare platform will capitalize on this platform shift to redefine the industry.

We are the team to do this. At Triple Aim Partners, I saw firsthand how the team took personal proceeds from the sale of SCA to United and created multi-billion dollar businesses, and I’ve been fortunate to be involved in building multiple successful multi-site healthcare businesses in Guidelight and Steadfast, building and refining the key playbooks. We are layering on the generational impact of AI on top of these proven businesses at ANNA, and we have the foresight to understand that this will be replicated across all of healthcare

We have the opportunity to upsize a $1 - 5 billion outcome to a $10 - 50 billion outcome.

Pediatric and adolescent mental health is the closest adjacency to autism care, with co-occurring mental health conditions present in 54 - 94% of individuals with autism. Within pediatric and adolescent mental health, 1 in 5 children and adolescents have been diagnosed with a mental health condition. There are several superior clinical and business models to build within this space alone:

Pediatric mental health

Adolescent behavioral addictions

Adolescent eating disorders

Pediatric trauma and PTSD care

Pediatric ADHD & executive functioning disorder

Adolescent substance use disorder

This represents just the beginning of the trajectory, starting with adjacencies to ANNA’s core model in pediatrics and behavioral health and compounding advantages across specialties and demographics. Blueprint is positioned not just to build category leaders across healthcare, but to transform the category of healthcare services itself into an AI-enabled, highly scalable, and high margin business model that delivers superior outcomes for patients, families, and clinicians.

# ANNA Origins

ANNA opened our doors in February 2024 for our first location in Sudbury, Massachusetts. The results were the following:

ANNA Sudbury ARR, March 2024 - December 2024

We started ANNA with the hypothesis that the gold-standard of evidence-based care, Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI), was a clinical model that was both superior for autistic children, particularly in early intervention, and actively sought after by referral sources and families alike. The response was immediate - ANNA's first location was profitable within 4 months of opening. In total we spent $57,668 to breakeven on the location, and 1 year later we generated $1,000,000+ in annualized profit at that one center. The 18.5x+ return on investment was remarkable, but the profit stream from center one was worth far more than just $1,000,000. Applying a 10% cost of capital, this cash flow stream was worth over $10 million on that same ~$58,000 of investment, representing a ~185x+ return on investment.

ANNA Center-Level Return on Investment

We opened our second center in Wayland, Massachusetts and grew from 0 to $1.6 million in ARR within just 6-months, growing at a faster rate than our Sudbury center and proving out the multi-site playbook.

ANNA Wayland ARR, March 2025 - August 2025

# ANNA Initial Strategy

There are four main functions that are core advantages for ANNA:

We have a repeatable, scalable approach to delivering high quality services,

We have repeatable, scalable methodologies to recruit and develop clinical talent,

We have repeatable, scalable, and profitable channels of attracting families, and

We could consistently drive strong and improving economics

Rather than evaluating these independently, the core advantage arose from the compounding benefit of layering each upon the other. When ANNA got started, the Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention (NDBI) model had not previously been implemented outside of an academic setting (note that other clinical models have been advertised but are not true to the clinical guidelines). The superior clinical model was the initial wedge into attracting both the best talent - who were looking for a better way of delivering services - and families. Due to the extensive word-of-mouth between both clinicians and between families, ANNA compounded growth to both clinicians and to families. Substantial training and development infrastructure further accelerated the quality of clinical services and talent, thus attracting more families.

## Clinical Excellence

The Vineland Adapt Behavior Scale (VABS) is broadly considered the most expansive outcome metric for autism services, as it measures comprehensive development across various domains against a representative peer set. ANNA’s outcome metrics have been proven to far outpace competition across all major domains, which accelerates the flywheel of attracting families, clinicians, and favorable payor contracting. (ANNA's commercial rates are 20 - 40% higher than rack rates).

ANNA Vineland Scores vs. Cortica and NADR

## Recruiting

ANNA has had strong success recruiting clinicians based predominantly on three factors: 1) Word-of-mouth referrals from staff, 2) Market-level brand awareness, and 3) Attraction to new clinical model. In particular the clinical model attraction has allowed us to meaningfully expand the population of BTs we can bring into ANNA given our internal training infrastructure.

ANNA BT Funnel Economics, YTD 2025

YTD in 2025, we have had 2,549 applicants for the BT position, of which we have accepted 69, representing a 2.7% acceptance rate.

BCBAs have been similarly strong given a similar set of factors, with additional future volume deriving from our Master’s tuition reimbursement program, wherein we can invest in our team and create our own BCBAs.

ANNA BCBA Funnel Economics, YTD 2025

YTD in 2025 we have had 124 applicants for the BCBA position, of which we have accepted 13, representing a 10.5% acceptance rate.

Similar to growth, as we expand locations, we expand access to clinicians in the market, compounding underlying growth.

## Referral Generation

Referral generation was one of the first variables we were able to prove, far outpacing initial expectations in our core Middlesex market with Sudbury’s launch and led to us doubling down with our Wayland location. In every location, ANNA has a waiting list for services that we are actively processing through.

ANNA FDE Clients and ARR at Assessment, 3/1/24 - 10/1/25

Importantly growth compounds as it is sub-market specific, so as we open more locations, we open up new avenues for growth. Also notable is the growth is highly capital efficient given the strong LTV of our intervention services.

ANNA Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

This brand-led flywheel was the foundation with which ANNA was initially founded to accelerate growth and generate economies of scale. All of this changed when AI was introduced into the business. The incorporation of AI across every function - including the clinical care delivery itself - within ANNA represented a tectonic shift in the operating business model, scalability, and margin profile of the business.

## Economic Efficiency

ANNA’s first center demonstrated remarkable 4-wall economics, breaking even within 4-months of opening and with less than $100,000 of investment. At $1 million in annualized profit, this amounts to an organic opportunity for 10x exponential growth from internally generated cash flows. ANNA’s second center achieved $1 million in annual recurring revenue within 4-months of opening, and ANNA’s third center is breakeven within the first month of operation.

# ANNA Traction

## Massachusetts

Our real estate approach in Greater Boston consists of identifying the 7 core markets that make up greater Boston: 1) Middlesex, 2) Central, 3) North Shore Inside 95, 4) South Shore Inside 95, 5) North Shore, 6) South Shore, and 7) Worcester County and opening locations in each.

We have identified locations in each of these markets to open up new locations, with 4 locations open today (Sudbury, Wayland, Weston, and Woburn) and 1 location in construction (Braintree) and an additional 3 LOIs signed (Foxborough, Andover, and Worcester) each slated to open in Q1 2026. This compounds growth because each of these centers operates in a net new sub-market, which increases the reach for both referrals and clinician recruiting as mentioned prior, which generates the underlying exponential growth curve for the market.

ANNA Lease Locations, Greater Boston

Across just these 8 locations, ANNA can generate PF ARR of ~$40mm and contribution profit of ~$16 million, which makes the Massachusetts market highly profitable relative to the expected ~$4mm in corporate expense.

ANNA 2025 - 2026 Projections

The major learning from Sudbury and Wayland is that each sub-market can support more than 1 fully-ramped center, which means that the ~$35 million in top-line revenue across these 7 sub-markets is a fraction of the possible SAM. Indeed, ANNA centers can fit 30 - 60 clients at maturity, and our average sub-market have 2,000 - 5,000 autistic kids aged 1 - 6. At 3 centers per sub-market (90 - 180 clients), this is a $105 million top-line opportunity in Greater Boston alone. This is before consideration of Springfield and other large metros in Massachusetts outside of Boston.

ANNA Target Market Autism Prevalence

## Expansion Markets

### Summary

With regards to market expansion, there are effectively 4 main workstreams that are completed in order to effectively open a market: 1) Licensing with the state, 2) Contracting with Payors, 3) Recruiting a GM, and 4) Real Estate. These are often parallel processes, though some dependency may arise such as waiting on the license for contracting with payors. The fifth related but separate workstream comprises all four, which is growing via acquisition. The acquisition automatically unlocks licensing, contracting, and real estate (though recruiting we aim to install our own GM at the market-level). As shown below, in Massachusetts we have completed all of these workstreams.

Massachusetts Market Expansion Trajectory

We are parallel process opening five other markets: 1) Washington, 2) Arizona, 3) Indiana, 4) Minnesota, and 5) Missouri.

### Washington

In Washington we are both fully licensed and fully contracted in the state with Regence, Premera, and Kaiser Permanente (the last of which is a highly unique relationship given Kaiser’s tendency to work internally). We are opening this market via an MSO BCBA who is operating under her own brand but using ANNA’s TIN and operational infrastructure. Given the synergistic relationship between home-based services through an MSO and our center-based model, we can freely double down on the market with our core ANNA model when convenient.

Washington Market Expansion Status

Washington Target Sub-Markets

### Arizona

In Arizona, we have completed the state licensing process and are in process of contracting, hiring a GM, and real estate selection. We have mapped out the real estate options in the market and will begin touring them once we hire a GM into the market.

Arizona Market Expansion Status

ANNA Arizona Target Sub-Markets

### Indiana

In Indiana, our traction is very similar, with the state licensing already completed and actively contracting with payors and beginning a search for a market GM. We also have a map of our target real estate locations that we will begin touring with our real estate brokers in the market.

Indiana Market Expansion Trajectory

ANNA Indiana Sub-Market Analysis

### Minnesota

Minnesota is the first market that we are planning to enter via acquisition. While we have parallel processed organic market entry, the market is closed to new entrants as they roll out comprehensive licensure. This presents a strong tailwind as there’s an opportunity to solidify a strong presence in the market without new entrants via a highly attractive M&A opportunity. We have already identified the target, a small home-based operator known as Western Autism Services, which we can buy in full for < $500K, much of it deferred.

In so doing, we accelerate across all of the other market expansion workstreams, with a parallel process for a GM who’s helping lead the corporate development process, Prashant Dilwali.

Minnesota Market Expansion Trajectory

ANNA Minnesota Target Locations

### Missouri

Lastly Missouri is an opportunistic market that we’re also evaluating in the context of a small acquisition. We are negotiating terms with a seller in the state who is a clinician looking to offload the administrative burden, allowing us to insource great clinical talent through an inexpensive “acqui-hire” and accelerate market entry. This process is more nascent than the Minnesota acquisition process and less strategic as we can choose to enter organically.

Missouri Market Expansion Trajectory

Each of these markets layers on top of the other to compound the aggregate growth curve. The goal by year-end 2029 is to open 218 locations across 12 states, representing $1.02 billion in annual recurring revenue. Applying an EBITDA margin of 40%, this represents ~$406 million in Pro Forma EBITDA which, at a 20x multiple, is $8.1+ billion in enterprise value.

# ANNA Technology Strategy

The first application of ANNA's AI technology suite was on the operational side of the business, incorporating an AI voice agent for intakes and using web and voice agents for benefit verification, eligibility checks, and prior authorizations.

AI Prior Authorizations

The impact was immediate - the entire RCM function is a funnel wherein any points of misalignment result in denials, ultimately impacting cash flow. The uplift in clean claims from more accurate eligibility and benefit verification as well as prior authorizations results in a ~6%+ increase in net collections, ultimately driving cash flow yield. More importantly, the previously administrative burdensome process was infinitely scalable, enabling hypergrowth while maintaining high effectiveness.

Implications of ANNA AI RCM Tools

The second application of ANNA's AI technology suite is on the clinical side of the business. While operational AI has the opportunity to drive substantial centralized savings, the greatest opportunity for the applications of AI is on the clinical side of the business - actively improving care quality and gross margin. Healthcare services is by and large a business with operating leverage - provider-level economics drive unit level profitability and aggregate profitability. With provider costs fixed, incremental revenue has a substantially outsized impact on the P&L of a services asset. A highly compelling opportunity exists to create dedicated AI agents that automate and streamline non-clinical activities to enhance the revenue throughput that falls directly to the bottom line. To illustrate this, here is the impact of ANNA's clinical AI suite:

ANNA BCBA Margin Profile Pre and Post AI

BCBAs have historically been viewed as a cost structure or margin sink on the ABA business, which is why caseloads stretch to unsustainable levels. In ANNA's case, we were able to identify all of the non-clinical activities that BCBAs were spending their time on and automate them by creating purpose-built AI agents.

The first such tool built at ANNA is Blueprint, an AI Treatment Plan generator that streamlines the process of writing treatment plans for clients. These treatment plans were reported to take 12 hours each for our clinicians, with only 3 hours of allocated billable time. This 9 hour delta every 6-months for up to 12 clients amounted to over $25,000 in annual lost revenue per BCBA. With the introduction of Blueprint, BCBAs can not only streamline the treatment plan writing process incorporating AI, our data model centralizes every treatment plan and every client's information to build a vector database that we actively conduct RAG on to improve the quality of the model.

ANNA Blueprint–AI Treatment Plan Generator

The second BCBA-oriented product in development is known as Guideline, an AI fidelity tool. Rather than traditional, non-billable fidelity checks for every BT, our computer vision AI fidelity model can ingest the live session video and provide clinical recommendations to the BTs.

ANNA Guideline–AI Fidelity Check

The third product to be developed is Lucent: AI Clinical Decision Support, which ingests treatment plan documents and treatment progress goals to provide BCBAs with 24/7 access to clinical recommendations engine trained on ANNA’s clinical protocols to support protocol modification and goal setting for their BT and the client.

ANNA Lucent–AI Clinical Decision Support

These products are just the beginning of a reinforcing clinical AI suite that continually ingests data to improve the quality of clinical services at scale while automating lower value tasks away from our clinical teams, enabling them to focus on only their highest leverage clinical responsibilities.

The implications of these tools is not only a substantial uplift in BCBA-level and center-level profitability, but also a simultaneous investment into the clinical quality of services delivered at ANNA. The biggest limit on scalability of a novel clinical model is the extensive lift required to train and continually monitor + develop the clinical practices of an increasingly large workforce. With the utilization of an AI LMS for initial training, AI fidelity for continual monitoring, and AI treatment planning for quality coordination, this limiter has not only been removed but entirely reversed. This infrastructure is both infinitely scalable and reinforcing in value - continually ingesting and improving. Going back to our four vectors of success, best-in-class clinical quality with fewer working hours drives referrals, recruiting, and payor relationships.

ANNA 5-Year 4-Wall Economics

The implications of the reinforcing benefit of AI at the ANNA operating level indicate a fundamental change in the potential margin profile of healthcare services companies. Once trending between 15 - 25% EBITDA margins, AI has created substantial leverage on the business to achieve 40% EBITDA margins - in line with leading software businesses.

Impact of AI on Contribution Margin

Because of the operating leverage in the unit model, greater utilization of just ~25% more billable across the center drives an outsized ~53% increase in contribution profit, which fundamentally redefines the nature of healthcare services from a scalability and capital efficiency perspective.

To high-level quantify the impact of the tools in use today, the utilization improvements drive significant economic benefit to both the clinicians and to ANNA via automating or streamlining previously manual or inefficient tasks.

These implications have a ripple effect on scalability as mature centers can each fund 8 additional centers to breakeven, creating organic opportunities for exponential growth by reinvesting residual cash flow from mature units into profitable units.

This is not well understood. The far and away most common path for a company embracing AI today is to build the application layer on top of the foundational models rather than to vertically integrate into owning the economics of the end customer. While I believe that this will make for a number of highly valuable businesses, there are three key insights that make vertical integration a more compelling opportunity:

Last-Mile Problem: Within healthcare, AI at the application layer struggles from a last-mile problem. Healthcare companies tend to be too idiosyncratic in their workflows and technology stacks for a pure horizontal application to address the underlying requirement. For example, we couldn't purchase an AI treatment plan automation tool off-the-shelf because our clinical model is unique and the EMR into which we integrate is customized. The most common way to address the last mile problem is through a forward-deployment GTM, but this adds significant cost, which leads to:

Limited Pricing Power: Pricing power for AI applications is generally limited. The perception is because these companies are effectively reselling compute with a front-end, but my perspective is that the issue actually lies with the replacement cost. The traditional software business relied on economies of scale to drive value to their end customers. They'd invest considerable resources into R&D that create a substantial replacement cost, thus earning them the right to charge high prices for licenses. With the cost of development collapsing as a result of increasingly effective AI tooling, the replacement cost of insourcing a previously outsourced AI application is substantially lower.

Value Capture: Lastly, the profit pools themselves have expanded so drastically that the point of leverage is in the residual owner of that profit pool rather than the tooling that enables the creation of it. For the reason above, AI applications create exceptional amounts of value, but the dollar amount of that value is largely accruing to the customer.

Where there has more recently been activity on the implications of AI transformation is in the venture-financed M&A playbook; however, this model is transient as the acquiring multiples expand to the perception of fair market value. Further, an M&A playbook leveraging AI can acquire a 20% margin asset at 7.5x, double top-line and double margin to 40% to flip for a 4x return, but the real value creation occurs when rather than buy at 7.5x you can build at 0.1x with the same playbook.

Acquisition vs. De Novo Economic Comparison

Further differentiation detail below:

Comparison of Company Creation Models

# The Blueprint Opportunity

The four core advantages for ANNA of: 1) Clinical services, 2) Recruiting, 3) Referrals, and 4) Payor Networks that both created a compounding advantage and are significantly accelerated as a function of AI are not specific to ANNA. These core competencies are applicable across all healthcare services companies representing $2.5 trillion in annual spend segmented into dozens of specialties and hundreds of sub-markets.

The opportunity is to scale the compelling de novo healthcare services playbook across adjacent specialties by leveraging a centralized platform for the repeatable creation of category-defining, AI-enabled healthcare services businesses, henceforth known as Blueprint Health. (This would be initiated by converting ANNA into a wholly-owned OpCo of the Blueprint Health HoldCo). To do so, there are three key pillars: 1) People, 2) Playbooks, and 3) Product.

## People

The infrastructure to consistently build world class teams has been institutionalized in a number of different instances. The best comparable to the proposed Blueprint model is Alpine Investors' Executive Talent Program. Alpine has systematized the recruiting and training of various executives, mainly from leading business schools. The Investors-in-Residence (IIR) model recruits investment professionals to consistently ideate and diligence company ideas. The CEO-in-Training (CIT) model recruits young professionals into the business to join at the earliest days into an Alpine portfolio company. The CEO-in-Residence (CIR) model recruits experienced CEOs to join the Alpine businesses and run them, often with a CIT in direct support as a GM. Another relevant comp in talent development is Palantir, which originated the "Forward Deployed Engineer" model to effectively train a product-minded full-stack engineer in the underlying Palantir products and then build the last mile into their enterprise and defense customer's workflows and technology stacks.

In creating a world-class talent development engine, Blueprint centralizes a pod of the following individuals:

Investor-in-Residence (IIR): Tasked with consistently conducting comprehensive diligence across specialties and markets to identify opportunities that fit specific requirements. Recruited from leading venture capital and private equity firms for more entrepreneurial exposure.

CEO-in-Training (CIT): 0-to-1 operational specialists who can be trained in the Blueprint playbooks to stand up new businesses and transform concepts into companies, with the potential to join in a GM role. Recruited from the mid-tier level of leading multi-site healthcare companies such as Regional Operations Director or Division Vice President for more company ownership.

Forward-Deployed Engineer (FDE): Product-minded full-stack AI engineer with the ability to build the centralized elements of the Blueprint product suite and deploy the last-mile integrations to fit the requirements of the operating companies. Recruited from other AI companies for greater ownership, responsibility, entrepreneurial experience.

Once the Initial business is up and running with an AI native technology stack and mature unit-level economics, a CEO-in-Residence (CIR) can be installed with extensive former experience as a C-Suite executive at a multi-site healthcare company to accelerate growth across markets. Lastly, prior to launch, a significant investment is made into identifying and attracting the previous leaders of a given specialty to serve as on the Board of Directors - creating substantial leverage for the operators.

ANNA Company Creation Pod

## Playbooks

Healthcare services companies sit on top of several key functions that all must be perfected in order to build a scalable and impactful company. Each of these distinct functions lends themselves well toward a centralized playbook that is reinforced in value with scale as it is applied and iterated upon. These include:

Market selection: Identifying attractive geographies by analyzing reimbursement dynamics (commercial and government), labor availability and cost, competitive density, and regulatory environment. Strong market selection ensures favorable economics.

Sub-market selection: Pinpointing the most promising neighborhoods or catchment areas within a broader market. This involves evaluating referral networks, payer mix distribution, local demographics, transportation access, and unmet demand for services.

Real-estate operations: Securing, developing, and managing clinic sites in a way that optimizes coverage, patient experience, and cost efficiency. Includes site selection, lease negotiations, and facility build-outs.

Payor contracting: Negotiating and managing relationships with commercial and government payers to secure favorable rates, predictable reimbursement, and access to patient populations. This also includes exploring value-based arrangements and navigating payer-specific policies.

Recruiting clinical talent: Building and maintaining a steady pipeline of qualified clinicians. This function encompasses sourcing, employer branding, competitive compensation design, and structured onboarding processes to ensure strong retention.

Attracting referrals: Developing and nurturing referral relationships with physicians, schools, hospitals, and community organizations. Effective playbooks for institutionalizing referral generation and outreach management.

Clinical fidelity: Ensuring that care delivery adheres to evidence-based protocols and the organization’s standards of excellence. This includes clinician training, outcome measurement, quality assurance, and continuous improvement programs to protect both patient outcomes and brand reputation.

Revenue cycle management: Managing the full billing lifecycle - from insurance verification and prior authorization to coding, claims submission, denial management, and collections. Strong RCM ensures revenue capture, accelerates cash flow, and minimizes write-offs.

Centralized playbooks deployed into each of the operating companies are uniquely valuable in this space because there are so many points of leverage. As compared to enterprise software wherein the playbooks around product development, sales, and customer success are largely established, healthcare has historically been inefficient. This inefficiency creates opportunity for compounding advantages across functions.

## Product

Lastly, centralized product is what transforms services assets into category defining businesses. Just as the core playbooks of healthcare services are extensible to the last mile, the core products are extensible as well. Blueprint is well positioned to occupy a Palantir-like model of developing a centralized set of operational and clinical products that can then be deployed into the unique stacks and workflows of the operating companies for maximum leverage. Products that are common across specialties and create significant leverage include:

AI Scribe: Automatically generates structured clinical documentation from patient–clinician interactions, reducing administrative burden and improving accuracy.

AI Clinical Decision Support: Automates clinical recommendations at the point-of-care for superior clinical outcomes

AI Fidelity: Monitors clinical care delivery to ensure adherence to clinical protocols and improve quality of services

AI LMS: Delivers personalized training modules and adaptive learning for clinicians and staff, reinforcing best practices and reducing variability in care.

AI Care Coordination: Coordinates discharge and post-discharge activities as well as navigates handoffs for patients to care team

AI Referral Management: Tracks, scores, and nurtures referral sources to strengthen relationships and improve growth.

AI Eligibility Checks: Instantly verifies patient coverage and plan details, preventing claim denials and delays at the point of intake.

AI Benefit Verification: Automates detailed confirmation of covered services, co-pays, and deductibles to ensure financial transparency for patients and providers.

AI Prior Authorization: Automates prior authorization requests by pre-populating forms, submitting requests, and tracking payer responses.

AI Scheduling: Optimizes provider schedules and patient appointments to maximize capacity utilization while reducing wait times and no-shows.

AI Patient Engagement: Uses tailored communication to improve attendance, adherence, and long-term patient retention.

AI Intake: Automates initial intake and patient onboarding by capturing key criteria and integrating directly into scheduling, EHR, and RCM workflows to improve conversion.

## ANNA People, Playbooks, and Product

To demonstrate this model in effect at ANNA, we have proven the approach for each of these pillars:

### ANNA People

Investor in Residence–Aimun Malik: Previously a private equity and venture capital investor, deploying over $500 million across various companies and asset classes before joining Triple Aim Partners, a leading healthcare company creation platform with the responsibility of building new companies. Aimun went 0-to-1 with four healthcare companies, Diverge Health, Oasis Health, Guidelight Health, and Steadfast Health. Today, these businesses are worth over $1.5 billion.

CEO-in-Residence–Becky Miller: Originally an investor at Audax Group and a consultant at Oliver Wyman, Becky joined capitated palliative care company Landmark as an Executive Director and General Manager of the New England market, the largest market of the company covering 18,000 lives. Becky led the integration of the Prospero acquisition and supported the sale to Optum before joining SUD care delivery business Better Life Partners as General Manager and Head of Growth.

Forward Deployed Engineer–William Nguyen: William began his career as a Software Engineer at Apple before joining Tempus AI as a Senior Python Engineer working on AI-driven clinical analytics and Jasper as a Founding Engineer leveraging LLMs for marketing workflow automation. William was mostly recently a senior full-stack AI engineer at Deel, applying large language models to automate complex onboarding and compliance workflows.

### ANNA Playbooks

There are an extensive number of playbooks at ANNA underpinning the various key functions within ANNA’s operations, but to dive deeper into one of them, sub-market selection is one of the most critical decisions for a de novo healthcare services company.

At ANNA, we’ve developed a replicable model of sub-market identification that ingests data across population metrics, demographics, insurance coverage, population density, referral sources and competition that are pulled into an ArcGIS instance to directly view the attractiveness of individual sub-markets within a given state to optimize both the initial launch strategy of opening up a new state as well as the long-term market density strategy.

ANNA ArcGIS Sub-Market Selection Engine

This centralized infrastructure is sufficiently modular to change the underlying inputs based on the business and analyze the specifics of any market for any specialty or sub-specialty, imbuing a significant advantage for the go-to-market team as they expand across markets.

### ANNA Product

Covered in detail previously, the operational tools are largely immediately extensible into the various operating companies given the generalities within processes like revenue cycle management, recruiting, and patient intake. As a result of the similarity in functionality across end customer, horizontal AI-native operational products can be easily procured and integrated directly into the operating companies. The centralized advantage on the operational AI derives primarily from effective procurement and contracting.

The significant product leverage in the model derives from the ability to utilize a centralized product for clinical workflows to drive efficiency and quality:

Learning Management System

Treatment Planning

Fidelity

Clinical Decision Support

Care Coordination

ANNA Clinical AI Roadmap

The reinforcement of the model is ultimately what drives compounding value. An underlying data model centralizes the ANNA NDBI clinical practices, which is then used to build tooling across the entire BCBA clinical workflow:

Elevate–Learning Management System: As soon as clinicians join ANNA, competency is evaluated across the relevant ANNA clinical axes, creating dynamic learning opportunities built on top of the underlying data model

Blueprint–Treatment Plan Generation: Copilot for BCBAs in treatment plan writing, guiding toward best practice of care and reinforcing through RAG on treatment plans already written to strengthen clinical base

Lucent–Clinical Decision Support: Real-time clinical decision support for clinicians in creating and refining treatment goals and approaches for clients and families, informed by the treatment plans

Guideline–AI Fidelity: Computer vision model ingesting videos of sessions and making clinical recommendations based on the underlying model and reinforced by the data from clinical decision support and the treatment plan

Bloom–AI Parent Coach: Personalized AI BCBA ingesting the entirety of ANNA’s clinical model as well as the treatment plan and the progress goals to support families in real-time

# Why Now

## AI Opportunity

AI has unlocked an entirely new frontier within healthcare services, an opportunity to transform care delivery via the repeatable creation of category-defining healthcare businesses. The opportunity for Blueprint Health compounds the remarkable de novo economics that we've already proven at ANNA and sets a foundational opportunity to leverage the core infrastructure to build a generational company creation engine. The $2.5 trillion healthcare services market is ripe for innovation - delivering a transformative experience for patients and providers alike. This transformation begins with the clinical model itself - AI has enabled the transformation of clinical care delivery to be aligned with the highest quality, evidence-based practice at scale via tools like AI LMS, AI clinical fidelity, and AI wraparound clinical care delivery plugging the gaps between care.

During my time at Triple Aim Partners, I was involved in building four companies from the ground up - Oasis Health and Diverge Health in the capitated primary care MSO markets and Guidelight and Steadfast in the multi-site behavioral business. Collectively these companies are worth over $1.5 billion and scaling rapidly leveraging the TAP core infrastructure. This same infrastructure was responsible for both of TAPs first two companies exiting for over $1 billion each - Prospero and ArchWell. AI has created an opportunity to build businesses that build upon TAP’s remarkable success with compounding centralized advantages and superior and reinforcing clinical value.

## Operating Company Criteria

We tackle new markets based on characteristics that we know will scale quickly, drive long-term durability, are large market opportunities, and match our criteria. Blueprint is beginning in the behavioral health space given the competencies and adjacencies to ANNA’s core business model, and each iteration of new operating company builds new expertise to continue to expand the surface area across healthcare services:

The primary criteria for a specialty within the Blueprint model are the following:

Clinical Quality: a compelling opportunity to leverage a high quality, evidence-based clinical model that is not widely practiced in order to improve the quality of services via the institutionalization of clinical AI infrastructure.

Multi-Specialty: ability to layer on adjacent and ancillary services to better serve patients and build toward a center-of-excellence with amortization of aggregate costs against the various service lines.

Outpatient: low capital expenditure enabling exponential return-on-invested-capital and rapid payback periods to continually fund growth organically, while bringing costs to payor partners down as compared to inpatient care.

Underserved: insufficient supply of dedicated or quality providers lending toward solving an important access problem in addition to delivering higher quality services

Blueprint AI Specialty Map

For each of these specialties and sub-specialties, Blueprint leverages ANNA’s competencies to bring to bear the following points of value:

AI Clinical Infrastructure: Customized clinical AI tooling including LMS, point-of-care, and fidelity to scale the highest quality clinical model

AI Operational Infrastructure: Operational AI customized into business workflows and tech stack by forward-deployed engineer to expand provider capacity by streamlining non-clinical workflows

Payor Network Development: Deep, centralized relationships with payors to expand reach and create mutually favorable contracting structures

Operations Playbook: Comprehensive operational playbook across all key functions

Talent: Top tier talent from centralized CIR, CIT model

The next three companies for Blueprint to launch are the following:

Pediatric Multi-Specialty Mental Health NewCo: combine Parent-Management Training (PMT) with Modular CBT (MCBT), creating a specialized model where parents become the primary agents of change in addressing pediatric conditions such as ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety, and depression. This integrated framework layers individual therapy, psychiatry-driven medication management, and structured group IOP/PHP programming with PMT’s parent-led interventions, ensuring therapeutic strategies are consistently reinforced at home and across settings. AI delivers adaptive parent training modules, real-time fidelity monitoring of parent-child interactions, and supplemental parent coaching between sessions, enabling higher adherence and more scalable outcomes than traditional clinician-only models. This family-centered, multi-specialty approach directly addresses the shortages in pediatric behavioral health and unlocks transformative potential in a fragmented $30bn+ U.S. pediatric mental health market growing at double-digit rates.

Adolescent Multi-Specialty Behavioral Addiction NewCo: integrate Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Internet and Gaming Disorders (CBT-IGD) with Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT) to create the most comprehensive and evidence-based model for adolescents struggling with compulsive gaming, gambling, pornography, and social media use. CBT-IGD provides structured, skills-based interventions to reshape maladaptive cognitions and build adaptive coping strategies, while MDFT addresses the multidimensional influences of family, peers, and school environments, ensuring treatment is reinforced across every part of the adolescent’s life. Group-based IOP/PHP programming further enhances outcomes by providing structured peer accountability and skill practice in a supportive setting. AI augments this framework by delivering adaptive CBT skill-practice modules, providing fidelity tools to ensure clinicians adhere to evidence-based protocols, and equipping families with AI-supported coaching to reinforce MDFT strategies between sessions. With current treatments for behavioral addictions often limited to fragmented or non-clinical interventions, this NewCo defines the first scalable, evidence-based continuum of care in a $15bn+ adolescent behavioral addiction market, meeting a rapidly growing and unmet need.

Adolescent Multi-Specialty Eating Disorder NewCo: anchors in Family-Based Treatment (FBT), the gold-standard for adolescent eating disorders, and strengthens it with specialized nutritional care, individual therapy, psychiatry-driven medication management when indicated, and group-based IOP/PHP programming. FBT empowers parents to lead recovery by taking charge of meals and weight restoration, while registered dietitians provide individualized nutrition plans, monitor medical and dietary progress, and collaborate closely with families to normalize eating behaviors. AI further expands scalability by training clinicians in true FBT protocols, reinforcing fidelity, and equipping parents with adaptive coaching and psychoeducation. This multidisciplinary, evidence-based model directly addresses the surge in adolescent eating disorder demand post-pandemic, meeting payer and family expectations for integrated psychiatric, therapeutic, and nutritional care while defining the first scalable continuum of care in a $10bn+ market.

The opportunity is not to just build a category-defining business, but to build a business that redefines the category of healthcare services.

## Pediatric Mental Health Opportunity Detail

Individuals with autism are 25x more likely to make a suicide attempt than non-autistic adults. This critical adjacency to the delivery of autism care is important not only in the context of more effective autism services but also in the context of more effective delivery of pediatric behavioral health overall. While extending pediatric behavioral health services to autistic individuals engaged with ANNA represents a first launching off point, the superior clinical model broadly for the 1 in 5 children with mental health conditions is a combination of Parent-Management Training (PMT), actively engaging parents in the delivery of clinical services, with Modular Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MCBT), a more flexible application of CBT to better fit the individual needs of children and adolescents.

Historically, the biggest challenge with delivering high quality pediatrics care was the shortage of trained clinicians, particularly in evidence-based models focused specifically on kids like PMT and MCBT. Leveraging the core Blueprint platform of AI LMS, AI Fidelity, and AI Clinical Decision Support with customization to the unique clinical model by a Forward-Deployed Engineer solves this training problem. This is particularly important as the supply side solution is to level up LPCs and LCSWs into the clinical model, who may have less aggregate experience than the training a neuropsychologist or pediatric psychiatrist has.

With the wedge of a superior clinical model delivered at scale, the same playbook of attracting the highest quality providers and generating referrals through superior clinical models, which ultimately drives payor coverage and rates can be applied.

In addition to a superior clinical model, the pediatric mental health operating company layers on the continuum of care including outpatient therapy, medication management, and IOP / PHP for group therapy. The result is a center-of-excellence model for families that is delivered at a higher margin as the various service lines amortize over a fixed operating cost structure.

Pediatric Mental Health NewCo Unit Model

The aggregate P&L spend to breakeven is ~$240,000 with a 5-year mature annual profit of ~$3.8 million, reflecting a 15x+ return on invested capital before applying a 20x multiple to the value of the cash flow stream. This center-of-excellence continuum of care also improves the go-to-market efficiency as patients can engage in multiple services across the continuum over time.

Applying that across a market building toward 31 locations in a particular market results in a 5-year contribution profit of ~$53.8 million.

Pediatric Mental Health Market-Level Financials

Opening up 14 markets by year 5 results in ~$145 million in net profit, with extensive growth in the maturation of units and markets to over ~$2.1 billion by year 10.

Pediatric Mental Health Consolidated Financials

Success in the pediatric mental health business positions Blueprint perfectly for additional operating companies in the pediatric behavioral space, with established payor relationships, real estate playbooks, referral generation relationships, recruiting playbooks, etc. Each new operating company expands the surface area of new builds and improves the centralized platform to further create value in the next company.

# Structure

Executing this strategy effectively requires the balance of centralized infrastructure for imbuing the core advantages into the relevant operating companies and decentralized operations for scalability of the model. The optimal structure to accomplish these two objectives is a HoldCo and OpCo structure, wherein the operating companies are launched as fully-owned subsidiaries of the HoldCo. More detail on the process is below.

Blueprint Structure

The transition would involve a number of key steps including creating a holding company and converting ANNA into a subsidiary of the holding company, staffing the holding company and conducing diligence + launching the new OpCo’s, and then capitalizing and staffing the OpCo’s to scale first within pediatric behavioral health and then beyond.

Key components of this model include having separate ESOPs at each of the OpCo levels to appropriately incentivize the respective management teams and separate pools of capital to deploy at the operating company level. Additional equity beyond the $5 million should be funded through external funding mechanisms based on company traction at the OpCo level.

Regarding timeline, the approach would be to build 2 new businesses each year, with the following key steps:

Ideation: Investor-in-Residence (IIR) defines the business model, including the problem statement, value proposition, specific markets, distribution channels, and economic model. IIR writes an initial memo with simple unit economic, market economic, and consolidated economic build.

Validation: IIR conducts expert calls with key stakeholders - competitors, payors, clinicians, referral sources - to confirm / alter underlying assumptions in initial memo and model, building toward a refined business plan and model.

Go-to-Market: IIR builds the go-to-market plan, including state selection, key initial hires, and regulatory requirements to NewCo launch

Tech Enablement: IIR collaborates with FDE to identify key opportunities for leverage from technology infrastructure are identified to drive operating margin, gross margin, quality and / or scalability.

Board Formation: IIR identifies and recruits “Mount Rushmore” of relevant space (including operators, clinicians, and payors), initially paying leaders in the space hourly as consultants with an opportunity to join the Board of Directors if company is launched. IIR uses collective wisdom to iron out the final business plan and financial model

Recruiting: IIR recruits CEO-in-Training (CIT) and clinical lead in collaboration with Blueprint leadership, rounding out company creation pod for company launch

Market Launch: Initial company is launched with licensing, contracting, credentialing process, real estate selection process, and recruiting process running in parallel to build initial de novo to test the business model and economics

Market Scaling: Upon maturation of unit-level economics, CEO-in-Residence (CIR) hired to scale the business across markets

## NDBI vs. ABA (and Clinical as a Wedge)

One hypothesis that we got very right with ANNA was that Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) as it is practiced today, in Discrete Trial Teaching, doesn’t work. Our belief is that in many cases it’s actively harmful to children’s development, particularly early learners. There are three reasons for this:

Extrinsic Motivation: DTT uses repetitive drills and external rewards (e.g., edibles) to prompt behaviors, but this reduces intrinsic motivation for the child. This becomes even more harmful when the adult-led model continues to prompt for the behaviors and the child negatively responds (deregulates)

Lack of Generalization: DTT has heavy prompting, which means skills are practiced in very specific, sterile environments (often at a table). This leads to a decline in independence and even a learned helplessness.

Rigidity: The overly protocolized and highly rigid DTT sessions with contrived reinforcement creates escape and avoidance behaviors, which leads to unnecessary stress

The clinical model that we utilize at ANNA, Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI), is widely accepted amongst the academic community over the past decade since the seminal 2015 paper as the most evidence-based care, particularly for young learners. The play-based, developmentally appropriate model follows the child’s natural interests, uses natural reinforcements, and embeds learning into play. Going back to those three shortcomings:

Intrinsic Motivation: NDBI restores motivation by following the child’s lead. Learning happens through activities the child already enjoys, and the “reward” is naturally built into the experience (e.g., saying “bubbles” to get more bubbles). This makes learning joyful, self-driven, and sustainable.

Generalization: Instead of teaching in isolated drills, NDBI embeds learning into everyday moments — snack time, playtime, routines, and social interactions. Because skills are practiced across real contexts, they generalize naturally and become part of daily life.

Play-Based: NDBI sessions are dynamic, social, and developmentally aligned, reducing stress and increasing engagement. The therapist joins the child’s world, using play and relationships as the foundation for growth.

The first proof point of the validation of this hypothesis was the inbound interest from referral sources and families. The excitement about a different model was represented in the extensive waiting list we had within months of opening, and that we have had ever since that time. This is inclusive of families leaving other ABA companies for ANNA, which we’ve never had the reverse scenario. The second proof point was the staff adoption and excitement, a consistent theme of excitement around a clinical delivery model that made sense for clients and clinicians alike. The final proof point was in the outcomes (shown previously) and the rapid adoption amongst payor partners, including Kaiser Permanente which is almost entirely an insular network.

This advantage has led us to be successful against the full gamut of competitors - private-equity backed roll-up players, MSO enablement companies, even venture-backed competitors in our market. Our superior clinical model gave us preferential access to families, referral sources, talent, and payor network + rates. It also solidified a barrier to entry as the investment into clinical training, protocols, and fidelity (creating our own data collection methodologies, assessment models, treatment plan structures, and fidelity methodologies)--now being codified into technology–reinforces itself in value.

Note, the MSO model and venture-backed home-based care model are inherently flawed because of 1) structural utilization disadvantage as a result of disproportionate after-school hours and 2) diseconomies of scale in home-based services with compounding scheduling complexity. The PE-backed ABA model is similarly challenged because of the reliance on 40-hour weekly billing and particularly the long-tail of 12+ years (ages 6 - 18) of home-based services which, while less intensive, drive the outsized cost curve. ANNA’s early diagnosis and early intervention model can deliver greater developmental progress in 20 hours of intensive intervention from ages 1.5 - 6 and then transition to school, improving access during highest neuroplasticity levels and decreasing spend as clients transition to school.

The outstanding question as to why this hasn’t been adopted across the market exhibits both a core advantage of ANNA and for Blueprint in each of the adjacent specialties. The first limiting factor is talent, and we have two of the PhD-level researchers who worked on the seminal team’s NDBI project. The second is the process of training, delivering, and supervising a novel clinical model at scale across dozens of sites each in dozens of markets is an exceptionally difficult lift. It is a substantial investment for PE firms with debt coverage ratios to make and nearly impossible for MSOs with a contracted workforce. This has become achievable at scale recently through AI clinical infrastructure mentioned throughout the memo.

There is a better model of care in every specialty and particularly every subspecialty, and for the first time we can deliver the highest quality specialized care at scale in any advanced clinical modality, which is the wedge into winning demand and supply and catalyzing the positive feedback loop of scale.

## Technology Deep Dive

Blueprint Centralized Technology Asset Detail

The Blueprint HoldCo technology chassis is a centralized, unified tech platform that powers a family of specialized healthcare operating companies. It serves as the common engine linking data, AI, and applications across multi-specialty healthcare domains. By providing a shared infrastructure this chassis allows each OpCo to rapidly deploy domain-specific solutions without rebuilding the core infrastructure.

### AI Operational Data Layer

The AI Operational Data Layer is the foundational data collection stratum of the Blueprint technology chassis. Its purpose is to consolidate all raw operational and clinical data, in every format and cadence, into a unified, traceable substrate for higher layers of the stack to consume.

This functions as the data gravity well of the Blueprint ecosystem - the first point where every operational and clinical signal lands before curation, modeling, or inference. It guarantees that all operationally relevant data is captured, versioned, and made machine-accessible with full lineage, ensuring downstream reliability and auditability. The layer integrates the full range of healthcare and operational systems used across Blueprint’s network of OpCo’s:

These inputs together define the operational fabric of each OpCo — from intake and scheduling to patient outcomes — and flow continuously into the data lakehouse for harmonization.

### Unified Data Lakehouse (Foundational Data Layer)

Above the AI Operational Data Layer lies the Unified Data Lakehouse, the foundational data layer of the Blueprint technology chassis. This layer is implemented using AWS-native data services and selected open-source orchestration tools to provide scalable, fault-tolerant ingestion, harmonization, and storage of both structured and unstructured healthcare data.The Lakehouse relies on a modern ingestion fabric built from the following core technologies:

AWS Glue: Serverless ETL and schema management for both batch and streaming pipelines. Glue jobs transform raw operational data (e.g., EMR or RCM extracts) into standardized, analytics-ready formats.

Airbyte: Open-source connector framework used to extract data from SaaS and legacy systems (e.g., CRMs, HRIS, LMS) with automatic schema discovery and incremental sync.

Amazon Kinesis: Real-time streaming backbone that handles event-level data ingestion (e.g., HL7/FHIR messages or live encounter updates). It ensures low-latency delivery into the raw data zone.

AWS Step Functions: Orchestration layer coordinating multi-step ETL workflows, error handling, and event-driven triggers across ingestion jobs, transformations, and downstream loading.

The Lakehouse is built on Amazon S3 and natively supports multi-modal data:

Structured data (EHR, billing, scheduling tables).

Semi-structured data (FHIR JSON, HL7v2 messages, device telemetry).

Unstructured data (clinical notes, fidelity videos, audio transcripts, imaging, PDF forms).

Unstructured assets are stored in S3 object storage with references maintained in structured metadata tables, enabling unified query access through AWS Athena and Redshift Spectrum.

All harmonized data in the Lakehouse is semantically mapped to the Unified Data Ontology using AWS Glue jobs and Amazon Neptune as the knowledge graph store. This semantic mapping translates tabular data into relationships and entities — e.g., linking Patient, Encounter, Clinician, and OutcomeMeasure — that the AI & Intelligence Stack can reason over.

### Unified Data Ontology (Semantic Layer of Healthcare Knowledge)

Sitting above the Unified Data Lakehouse is the Unified Data Ontology, Blueprint’s semantic intelligence layer. This layer translates the harmonized data within the Lakehouse into a connected graph of entities and relationships, enabling context-aware reasoning, discovery, and interoperability across all OpCos.

It is implemented using Amazon Neptune, AWS’s fully managed graph database and knowledge-graph service, and represents the canonical “language” through which every dataset, model, and application within the Blueprint ecosystem communicates.

The Unified Data Ontology provides a shared, machine-interpretable schema that binds operational, clinical, and administrative data together under a single semantic framework. Where the Lakehouse organizes data by structure, the Ontology organizes it by meaning, defining how patients, clinicians, encounters, treatments, and outcomes interrelate.

By converting tabular data into graph-based entities, the ontology enables:

Cross-domain reasoning: Tracing relationships between care delivery, operations, and outcomes.

Semantic interoperability: Consistent interpretation of data across OpCos and applications.

Accelerated AI development: Models can reason over entities and relationships instead of flat tables.

Data lineage and policy inheritance: Every entity inherits governance and tagging rules through its semantic links.

The Unified Data Ontology is powered by an AWS-native knowledge-graph architecture, with the following components working in concert:

Amazon Neptune: Serves as the graph and knowledge store, supporting both RDF (Resource Description Framework) and labeled-property-graph models. It hosts entities (nodes) such as Patient, Clinician, Encounter, OutcomeMeasure, and edges representing real-world relationships (treatedBy, belongsTo, hasDiagnosis, producedOutcome).

AWS Glue: Executes the semantic mapping jobs that transform curated Lakehouse data into ontology entities and relationships. Each Glue job performs entity extraction, key resolution, and relation creation, populating Neptune incrementally as new data arrives.

The ontology is structured around a core schema common to all OpCos, with specialty-specific extensions layered on top:

This modular approach ensures semantic consistency across the enterprise while allowing local flexibility for specialty-specific care models.

All entities carry unique global identifiers (BGIDs), mapped from Lakehouse keys, enabling one-to-one traceability back to raw operational systems. Neptune’s indexing and SPARQL/Gremlin APIs allow both analytical queries (“How many patients have follow-up encounters within 7 days?”) and knowledge reasoning (“Which treatments correlate with improved outcomes in anxiety programs?”).

Ontology Population and Lifecycle

Data Arrival: Harmonized, curated datasets from the Lakehouse trigger AWS Glue semantic mapping jobs.

Entity Extraction: Glue jobs parse schema-mapped fields (e.g., patient_id, clinician_id) and instantiate corresponding nodes in Amazon Neptune.

Relationship Construction: Foreign-key and event-based links are converted into graph edges (e.g., Encounter → OutcomeMeasure).

Metadata Enrichment: Collibra policies and OpenLineage lineage data are attached to nodes and edges.

Continuous Updates: Kinesis events or scheduled Glue workflows update the graph as new records arrive, maintaining temporal consistency.

This pipeline ensures that the ontology is a living reflection of operational reality, continuously refreshed as data evolves.

### AI & Intelligence Stack

The AI & Intelligence Stack is the analytical and reasoning core of the Blueprint technology chassis where structured, curated, and semantically enriched data is transformed into predictions, recommendations, and contextual insights.

This stack operationalizes the Unified Data Ontology, using it as both a knowledge substrate and reasoning engine. By integrating machine learning, vector search, and large language models (LLMs) within a tightly governed AWS ecosystem, the AI & Intelligence Stack enables clinical-grade intelligence to be deployed consistently across all Blueprint OpCos.

The AI & Intelligence Stack transforms the ontology’s network of entities and relationships into actionable intelligence that powers:

Predictive analytics: e.g., patient risk stratification, operational forecasting.

Prescriptive recommendations: e.g., treatment optimization, resource scheduling.

Generative AI reasoning: e.g., clinical summarization, workflow automation, decision support.

This is achieved through a composable AI platform architecture built from AWS-native machine learning services and best-in-class open frameworks for retrieval, orchestration, and monitoring:

AWS Bedrock: Foundation Model Orchestration

Serves as the enterprise foundation model layer, hosting and managing generative AI models (e.g., Claude, Titan, Llama, Mistral) securely within Blueprint’s VPC.

Enables multi-model orchestration and prompt engineering workflows, allowing LLMs to be fine-tuned or specialized for healthcare-specific tasks (e.g., clinical summarization, patient communication, or compliance documentation).

Integrates with LangChain and Pinecone to enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounded in the Unified Data Ontology, ensuring that model outputs are contextually accurate and compliant.

Amazon SageMaker: ML Development, Training, and Deployment

Provides the core machine learning platform for structured and semi-structured modeling.

Supports end-to-end MLOps workflows: data preparation, feature store access, training, tuning, deployment, and batch or real-time inference.

Hosts predictive models for key healthcare and operational use cases such as:

Staffing and capacity forecasting

Denial prediction for RCM

Treatment adherence and outcomes prediction

SageMaker integrates directly with Neptune via AWS SDKs and APIs to pull graph-derived features (e.g., relationship counts, historical patterns) during feature engineering.

Outputs from SageMaker models are fed back into the Ontology as new derived entities (e.g., PredictedOutcome, RiskCategory), maintaining continuous learning loops.

LangChain: Orchestration and Agent Framework

Acts as the middleware for reasoning and LLM integration, managing the flow of context, prompts, and retrieved knowledge between Bedrock-hosted models and Blueprint data sources.

Implements RAG pipelines that connect LLMs with:

Pinecone (vector embeddings) for semantic retrieval

Amazon Neptune (ontology graph queries) for structured knowledge lookups

AWS Glue / Athena (curated Lakehouse datasets) for numeric fact retrieval

LangChain-based agents can call downstream tools such as scheduling APIs or knowledge services, enabling task execution (e.g., “Generate a care summary and schedule a follow-up appointment”).

Pinecone: Vector Database and Semantic Retrieval

Functions as the enterprise vector index for embeddings generated from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (notes, transcripts, documents).

Stores high-dimensional embeddings representing ontology-linked text artifacts, enabling semantic search and similarity reasoning.

When combined with LangChain and Bedrock, Pinecone allows generative models to retrieve grounded facts (e.g., patient summaries, clinical protocols) before generation, dramatically improving accuracy and reducing hallucination risk.

Updated continuously as new documents and clinical notes enter the Lakehouse; embeddings are recalculated on ingestion via Step Functions pipelines.

SageMaker Model Monitor: Continuous Model Governance

Provides automated observability and drift detection across all deployed ML models.

Monitors data quality (feature drift, label drift, prediction skew), model performance, and compliance metrics in real time.

Integrates with CloudWatch and OpenLineage for centralized alerting, lineage tracking, and compliance documentation.

Enables continuous improvement loops: when drift is detected, retraining pipelines are automatically triggered in SageMaker, and updated model versions are promoted through approval workflows managed by governance teams.

Workflow Integration and Reasoning Loop

Ontology Querying: AI services query the Unified Data Ontology (Amazon Neptune) to retrieve relevant contextual entities — patients, encounters, clinicians, outcomes, etc.

Feature Enrichment: Structured data from the Lakehouse (via Glue/Athena) and graph features from Neptune are merged in SageMaker Feature Store.

Inference: Predictive models in SageMaker or generative models in Bedrock perform reasoning or generation, mediated by LangChain orchestration.

Semantic Retrieval: Pinecone provides context embeddings to ground generative AI in verified clinical and operational knowledge.

Insight Delivery: Results are written back to the Ontology and surfaced to the Operational and Clinical Application Layers (e.g., RCM optimization, point-of-care recommendations).

Monitoring & Retraining: SageMaker Model Monitor and CloudWatch evaluate performance; feedback loops trigger retraining and ontology updates, creating a closed learning cycle.

Key AI Use Cases Across Blueprint OpCos

Each of these applications is deployed with standardized MLOps pipelines, ontology integration, and policy enforcement under the unified governance stack.

### Operational Application Layer

The Operational Application Layer powers the non-clinical, administrative, and patient-facing functions of Blueprint’s network. Built directly on top of the Unified Data Ontology and AI & Intelligence Stack, this layer delivers real-time automation and intelligence to streamline scheduling, intake, care coordination, marketing, and other workflows across each OpCo.

Operational applications are the executional interface of the Blueprint chassis. They consume ontology-defined entities (e.g., Patient, Appointment, Clinician, ServiceLine, MarketingLead) and intelligence from the AI stack to coordinate the patient journey from first contact to ongoing care.

The architecture supports live, bi-directional data exchange between applications and the ontology, meaning that updates in one operational system (like a confirmed appointment or a completed intake form) instantly propagate throughout the platform, keeping all services in sync.

### Clinical Application Layer

The Clinical Application Layer is where Blueprint’s technology chassis directly meets patient care. These applications empower clinicians, therapists, and care coordinators working across Blueprint’s outpatient specialty networks by embedding AI-assisted documentation, coordination, and decision support directly into their day-to-day workflows.

By combining automation, intelligence, and structured fidelity tracking, this layer serves a dual strategic function:

Drive operational efficiency and clinician leverage: Automating low-value, repetitive tasks (like documentation, coordination, and ordering) so providers can see more patients and bill more efficiently.

Elevate and standardize clinical quality: Embedding best practices into care delivery via point-of-care recommendations, fidelity scoring, and continuous clinician training through LMS-linked feedback.

Together, these two levers create a self-reinforcing system: as efficiency rises, so does quality, leading to scalable, profitable, and evidence-consistent care delivery across every OpCo.

The Clinical Application Layer consumes structured and semantic intelligence from the Unified Data Ontology (Amazon Neptune) and the AI & Intelligence Stack (AWS Bedrock, LangChain, SageMaker, Pinecone). It delivers that intelligence to end-users in real time, automating documentation, surfacing clinical insights, and enforcing best practices, while writing every clinical event and AI interaction back into the ontology for auditability and retraining.

This creates a closed-loop care system, where each patient encounter simultaneously generates structured data, trains the system, and refines future recommendations.

Core Outpatient Clinical Domains and Capabilities

### Continuous Feedback and Reinforcement Learning Loop

Blueprint’s AI ecosystem is designed as a self-improving clinical and operational learning system, not a static automation layer. Every clinician interaction, patient encounter, and operational event produces structured data that fuels continuous improvement across models, prompts, and workflows.

Human-in-the-Loop Feedback

Clinicians and staff provide explicit and implicit feedback throughout the workflow:

Documentation corrections (e.g., scribe note edits, CPT code changes) are captured and versioned.

Recommendation acceptance or rejection informs model preference optimization.

Fidelity scores and patient outcomes are linked back to model outputs to measure downstream effectiveness.

All feedback signals are logged into the Unified Data Ontology (Neptune) with provenance metadata and replayable lineage via OpenLineage.

Model Retraining and Drift Management

SageMaker Pipelines continuously retrain NLP, classification, and recommendation models using curated human-labeled data.

Bedrock model prompts evolve based on reinforcement signals—using LangChain feedback evaluators and Bedrock Guardrails metrics to adjust temperature, reasoning style, and grounding behavior.

Model Monitor and Data Quality Monitor detect distributional drift, prompting human review before redeployment.

Closed-Loop Reinforcement

Encounter occurs → AI assists (scribe, recommendation, routing).

Clinician validates or edits → feedback stored with ontology linkage.

Model retraining → performance metrics updated → improved inference on next cycle.

Updated models and prompts deployed automatically through SageMaker CI/CD pipelines with feature store versioning.

This loop transforms each patient interaction into a training instance, steadily improving documentation accuracy, clinical guidance precision, and workflow efficiency across the enterprise.

### Governance and Compliance Infrastructure

Blueprint’s platform architecture embeds governance, observability, and compliance from the ground up - ensuring every model output, workflow, and user action is auditable, explainable, and HIPAA-aligned.

Data Security and PHI Handling

All workloads operate within HIPAA-eligible AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Comprehend Medical, Transcribe Medical, Neptune, OpenSearch).

VPC isolation, KMS encryption, and private endpoints prevent data egress.

Lake Formation enforces column- and row-level access policies.

Comprehend Medical handles PHI entity detection and redaction during ingestion and processing.

Model and Prompt Governance

Model Registry (SageMaker) maintains full lineage of training data, hyperparameters, and deployment history.

Prompt Registry (LangChain + DynamoDB) versions Bedrock prompt templates, ensuring reproducibility of outputs.

Guardrails (Bedrock) enforce topic boundaries, prevent unsafe recommendations, and control disclosure of sensitive entities.

Observability and Auditability

OpenLineage tracks every transformation—from audio transcription through note generation to ontology ingestion.

CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Model Monitor provide operational observability and alerting.

Audit Logs (CloudTrail) capture every API call, model inference, and data write for forensic review.

Data Quality Checks within Glue ensure schema and ontology consistency across all OpCos.

Regulatory and Ethical Alignment

Complies with HIPAA, HITECH, and 42 CFR Part 2 for behavioral health.

Aligns with ONC Cures Act interoperability requirements through FHIR-based data exchange (via HealthLake and FHIR Works).

Adheres to Responsible AI principles—transparency, human oversight, and non-maleficence—encoded into workflow design.

### Forward-Deployed Engineer (FDE) Model and Domain Specialization

Blueprint’s Forward-Deployed Engineer (FDE) model operationalizes how the centralized AI platform at HoldCo is adapted, extended, and optimized for each Operating Company (OpCo). At its core, the model allows a single AI and data infrastructure, built and governed centrally by Blueprint HoldCo, to function as a modular, locally tuned system across diverse outpatient domains.

Platform Architecture

At the HoldCo level, Blueprint maintains a unified AI platform that serves as the foundation for all OpCos:

Data & Ontology Layer: Amazon Neptune provides a shared clinical ontology connecting entities across domains—patients, encounters, diagnoses, payors, and outcomes.

Intelligence Layer: AWS Bedrock, LangChain, and SageMaker form the cognitive core—handling LLM reasoning, retrieval orchestration, and predictive modeling.

Infrastructure Layer: Common pipelines and governance are implemented through Kinesis (streaming), Glue (ETL), Step Functions (workflow orchestration), and Lake Formation (security & data access).

Monitoring & Compliance: Model Monitor, CloudWatch, and OpenLineage ensure observability, reproducibility, and traceability across all inference events.

This unified stack defines a consistent baseline for security, governance, and interoperability across every OpCo.

FDE Customization and Deployment Process

The FDE model extends the HoldCo chassis into each OpCo through a controlled, feedback-driven technical adaptation process:

Integration and Ontology Extension

Each OpCo inherits the global ontology but adds domain-specific extensions. For example:

Behavioral Health introduces fidelity entities (session structure, adherence scores).

Women’s Health adds obstetric episode tracking and maternal risk hierarchies.

Orthopedics defines procedure-level entities for musculoskeletal interventions.

FDEs implement these through Neptune schema extensions and LangChain retrievers that allow Bedrock models to access localized clinical semantics without breaking global schema alignment.

Model Adaptation

Using SageMaker, domain-specific fine-tuning pipelines are established:

Behavioral Health → scribe tuning on SOAP/DAP notes

Women’s Health → prenatal risk and triage classification

Endocrinology → predictive modeling for metabolic adherence

Gastroenterology → NLP for endoscopy summaries

These specialized models remain linked to HoldCo’s central Model Registry, ensuring version control, traceability, and enterprise-wide retraining triggers.

Prompt and Workflow Orchestration

Within each OpCo, LangChain agents orchestrate domain-specific prompt templates and RAG pipelines:

Retrieval sources are mapped to the OpCo’s Neptune subset and data lake partitions.

Bedrock LLMs are prompted through standardized inference APIs, but with local clinical context injection for specialty accuracy.

Outputs are written back to Neptune via Glue jobs, maintaining structure and lineage.

Observability and Feedback

Every inference, whether an AI note, recommendation, or classification, emits structured metadata:

Input and output payloads, model versions, context sources, and clinician edits are logged.

OpenLineage and Model Monitor link these signals back to the HoldCo platform, triggering retraining pipelines in SageMaker when drift or degradation is detected.

Federated Reinforcement and Continuous Learning

The FDE model enables federated reinforcement across OpCos:

Each OpCo’s usage data and clinician feedback are captured as labeled signals.

HoldCo aggregates these signals within its Neptune-based learning ontology, generating global feature updates for SageMaker models and prompt evolution for Bedrock templates.

Improvements discovered in one domain (e.g., summarization accuracy in Behavioral Health) are automatically available to others through shared registries and CI/CD pipelines.

This architecture ensures that Blueprint functions as a learning system, where local deployments continuously refine global intelligence, and global updates propagate safely back to the edge.

Strategic Outcome

The FDE model transforms Blueprint’s centralized infrastructure into a scalable, adaptive, and intelligent deployment system:

HoldCo maintains the shared AI, data, and governance backbone.

FDE deployment pipelines translate that backbone into domain-specific intelligence for each OpCo.

Feedback loops ensure the system improves over time - technically, operationally, and clinically.

This architecture allows Blueprint to replicate its AI-enabled care model across any specialty, maintaining a unified technical foundation while continuously localizing for precision and performance.

### Conclusion

Blueprint’s technology chassis establishes a unified, end-to-end AI operating system for outpatient care - one that transforms data from every operational and clinical interaction into actionable intelligence, automation, and continuous improvement across all specialty networks. Each layer of this AI stack builds upon the one below it, forming a closed-loop system that converts raw data into insight, insight into automation, and automation into measurable gains in efficiency, quality, and scalability for every Operating Company (OpCo) within the Blueprint HoldCo network.

AI Operational Layer

The AI Operational Layer functions as the system’s data gravity well, the single ingestion point where every operational, clinical, and administrative signal enters the platform. By consolidating inputs from EHRs, RCM systems, CRMs, LMSs, HRIS platforms, and clinical media repositories, this layer guarantees completeness, version control, and lineage across all data sources.

This unification allows HoldCo to establish a single, machine-readable source of truth across all OpCos, ensuring that scheduling, billing, training, and patient-care data are synchronized and auditable.

Operational Impact:

Eliminates fragmented data silos and manual reconciliation.

Enables near-real-time operational visibility across the enterprise.

Establishes traceability essential for compliance and automation reliability.

Unified Data Lakehouse

Built on AWS Glue, Kinesis, Step Functions, and S3, the Unified Data Lakehouse harmonizes and stores multi-modal healthcare data at scale–structured (EHR, billing), semi-structured (FHIR, HL7), and unstructured (notes, transcripts, imaging). Airbyte connectors bring in SaaS and legacy data; Glue jobs standardize schemas; Kinesis ensures low-latency event streaming.

This layer transforms the raw data collected by the Operational Layer into curated, analytics-ready datasets with full lineage. It forms the data backbone that feeds both intelligence and application layers across all OpCo’s.

Operational Impact:

Enables scalable, governed data ingestion and transformation.

Reduces ETL complexity for each OpCo.

Supports cross-domain analytics and real-time dashboards with unified semantics.

Unified Data Ontology

The Unified Data Ontology (Amazon Neptune) translates the Lakehouse’s curated data into a connected graph of entities and relationships — patients, encounters, clinicians, outcomes, payors — all expressed under a shared semantic schema. This ontology is the common language of the enterprise, harmonizing data meaning across specialties and OpCos.

HoldCo maintains the core ontology, while each OpCo extends it with specialty-specific entities (e.g., therapy sessions, prenatal episodes, orthopedic procedures). This semantic layer enables cross-domain reasoning, interoperability, and governance inheritance, turning static data into a dynamic knowledge fabric that every AI model and application can query and reason over.

Clinical and Operational Impact:

Enables context-aware reasoning and analytics across domains.

Provides unified understanding of patients, clinicians, and outcomes.

Simplifies regulatory reporting and quality tracking through semantic consistency.

AI & Intelligence Stack

The AI & Intelligence Stack transforms semantic data into predictions, recommendations, and real-time reasoning. It integrates AWS Bedrock, LangChain, SageMaker, and Pinecone within a unified, HIPAA-governed ecosystem.

SageMaker powers predictive models for staffing, denials, adherence, and outcomes.

Bedrock orchestrates generative AI for documentation, summarization, and recommendations.

LangChain connects LLMs to the ontology, lakehouse, and vector stores for context-grounded reasoning.

Pinecone indexes embeddings for semantic retrieval and similarity search.

Together, these tools create an enterprise AI framework that’s both composable and self-improving, using feedback and retraining pipelines to enhance accuracy and efficiency continuously.

Impact:

Reduces clinician workload through automation of repetitive documentation.

Improves operational foresight through predictive analytics.

Enables safer, context-aware decision support at the point of care.

Operational & Clinical Application Layers

These layers convert intelligence into execution:

Operational Applications automate scheduling, intake, marketing, and care coordination. SageMaker forecasting models and LangChain agents dynamically optimize workloads, appointment matching, and patient outreach.

Clinical Applications deliver direct clinician enablement - AI-assisted documentation, point-of-care recommendations, fidelity scoring, and prescription validation - all grounded in ontology-linked context.

Every application writes its outputs back to the ontology, creating bi-directional data flow that ensures consistency between operations, care delivery, and analytics.

Impact:

Operational: Reduced no-show rates, optimized staffing, faster intake cycles.

Clinical: Higher billable utilization, better adherence to protocols, improved outcomes.
