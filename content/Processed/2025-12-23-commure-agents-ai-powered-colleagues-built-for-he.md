MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., December 10, 2025 – [Commure](http://commure.com), a leading healthcare technology company, today announced a new partnership with [Val Verde Regional Medical Center](https://www.vvrmc.org/) (VVRMC), a community-based hospital serving residents in Del Rio, TX and the surrounding Val Verde region. The organizations will partner to reduce administrative burden and enhance clinical documentation within the MEDITECH Expanse Electronic Health Record (EHR) by deploying [Commure Ambient AI](http://commure.com/ambient-ai), a solution that empowers clinicians with advanced clinical documentation support, autonomous coding, AI copilots, and more.

VVRMC selected Commure Ambient AI for its proven impact to reduce provider documentation time from 30 to 90 minutes a day across specialties such as cardiology and family practice. In addition, Commure will leverage its MEDITECH Alliance partnership to ensure deep integration with MEDITECH Expanse and rapid operational value for the medical center.

Through this collaboration, VVRMC will deploy Commure Ambient AI across multiple departments to advance its mission of delivering accessible, compassionate, high-quality care to every patient.

“Rural healthcare hinges on maximizing every minute of clinician time and every available resource,” said Keith Willey, CIO of VVRMC. “By integrating Commure Ambient AI into our clinical workflows, we’re enabling our providers to spend less time on documentation and more time where they’re needed most – at the patient’s side.”

For a rural health system like VVRMC, adopting this new technology represents a crucial advancement in addressing staffing challenges, physician burnout, and patient access disparities.   
  
“Val Verde Regional Medical Center exemplifies the innovation and resilience of rural healthcare organizations nationwide,” said Ian Shakil, Chief Strategy Officer of Commure. “Their leadership demonstrates that advanced AI doesn’t belong only to large urban systems; it belongs to every community striving to deliver exceptional care.”

VVRMC joins a nationwide cohort of pioneering hospitals and health systems using Commure Ambient AI to document millions of clinician encounters each year, automate coding, and deliver real-time support at the point of care.

[### Ob Hospitalist Group Launches Commure’s Autonomous Coding to Support Clinicians and Strengthen Coding Accuracy](/press-releases/ob-hospitalist-group-launches-commures-autonomous-coding-to-support-clinicians-and-strengthen-coding-accuracy)

**MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., December 3, 2025 -** [Commure](http://commure.com), a leading healthcare technology company, and [Ob Hospitalist Group](https://obhg.com/) (OBHG), the nation's largest provider of OB/GYNs and customized women's health solutions, announced a strategic partnership to deploy Commure’s Autonomous Coding to nearly 2,000 clinicians and over 200 care sites. The solution helps save clinicians and coders valuable time by automatically generating medical codes from clinical documentation (including CPT codes, ICD-10 diagnoses, and modifiers).

A long-time user of Commure’s charge capture technology, OBHG is rapidly scaling Commure Autonomous Coding across its hospital footprint. The results are striking: within three months, clinicians reduced time spent entering charges by 83%, and AI now codes over 85% of all charges.

"At OBHG, every innovation we adopt must enhance both quality and the clinician experience,” said Dr. Mark Simon, Chief Medical Officer at Ob Hospitalist Group. “Autonomous coding helps us achieve that balance by accelerating coding accuracy while maintaining the highest standards for compliance and clinical oversight. It’s a powerful example of how technology can support, rather than replace, the expertise of our clinicians and strengthen the value we bring to our hospital partners."

Commure breaks the cycle of 'familiar coding,' surfacing secondary diagnoses and specificities often overlooked in manual practice. OBHG plans to roll out this technology to over 200 sites over the next 12 months.

"By intelligently automating the complex, time-consuming tasks of coding and documentation, we are empowering providers to spend less time battling bureaucracy,” said Tanay Tandon, CEO of Commure. “Autonomous coding is a technology built for the front lines to reclaim the essence of care.”

Commure’s AI platform unifies ambient documentation, agentic AI, and revenue cycle automation to reduce administrative burden and elevate performance. Autonomous Coding is a key part of this approach. It increases accuracy, accelerates coding workflows, and supports a documentation-first process that keeps clinicians focused on delivering exceptional care.
