The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) is now in the crosshairs for DOGE cuts, and like many of the other reductions so far, [its defenders are wailing and gnashing their teeth](https://x.com/ariellesophia/status/1890865870794092893).

As with other departments facing elimination (how could anyone be against USAID? It’s *AID*… from the *U.S.*!), CMMI sounds great on paper but in reality is another cesspool of bureaucratic interventions, regulatory capture, and inefficiency.

Created by the Affordable Care Act, CMMI’s stated goal is to move Medicare and Medicaid away from fee-for-service and toward value-based care. It has attempted to do this through accountable care organizations, bundled payment initiatives such as the Comprehensive Joint Replacement (CJR) and TEAM bundles for spine, value-based purchasing programs, and various other “innovative” payment schemes. In theory, these programs were supposed to improve efficiency and reduce costs. In practice, they have shifted costs away from Medicare and onto providers—both hospitals and physician practices—by burying them under administrative complexity and bureaucratic compliance mandates.

Anyone working in healthcare has felt the downstream effects of these initiatives. These programs require massive documentation efforts, not just for quality metrics, but also for risk-adjustment models that determine payment. A CBO report noted that CMMI’s payment models impose “inconsistent and even contradictory” requirements on providers, leading to extra paperwork and confusion. Even just preparing for an impending payment model takes years of work and resources. Worse, many of these models are delayed or abandoned, making all of that work a complete waste of time.

As seen in the maternal health programs within CMMI, the cutting of which prompted the tweet linked above, this initiative is a prime example of waste and administrative burden. Many of its requirements interfere with the physician-patient relationship, adding unnecessary complexity to medical decision-making. For instance, the program penalizes C-sections, despite the fact that they are a completely safe and often necessary method of delivery. Instead of simply determining whether a C-section is medically indicated, physicians must now also consider whether performing one will result in a performance penalty for their hospital.

Beyond that, the program introduces layers of bureaucratic oversight that contribute to excessive administrative waste. The “Birthing-Friendly” designation, for example, requires hospitals to meet 64 different quality metrics, including several that stigmatize women who choose not to breastfeed. Among the mandated requirements is the collection of patient satisfaction surveys, which numerous studies have shown to be completely unrelated to the actual quality of care. These surveys are often influenced by superficial factors, such as the quality of the hospital cafeteria, rather than meaningful clinical outcomes. Instead of improving maternal health, this program exemplifies how CMMI initiatives can create perverse incentives, burden healthcare providers with excessive compliance measures, and ultimately divert attention away from patient care.

Even from a purely financial perspective, without accounting for the burden on physicians, CMMI has been a failure. Only six of the fifty payment models tested have saved Medicare any money at all. Only four models have met CMS’s own criteria for nationwide expansion. The CBO projects that CMMI will actually increase federal spending by $1.3 billion from 2021-2030, instead of delivering the savings it was created to achieve.

And this is just the cost to Medicare’s budget. The real cost of CMMI’s failures extends far beyond government spreadsheets. Hospitals and physician practices must hire more administrators just to comply with these complex programs. Doctors and nurses must spend time on documentation instead of patient care. The added bureaucratic workload drives seasoned physicians into early retirement, worsening physician shortages. Instead of incentivizing high-quality care, CMMI has incentivized consolidation and barriers to entry, pushing independent providers out of business.

For example, the American Hospital Association estimated that it costs around $12 million for a small ACO to set up the necessary infrastructure and over $26 million for a medium-sized ACO. This is a massive upfront investment that only large, well-established hospital systems can afford. Smaller independent providers are effectively locked out, leading to further market consolidation—the very opposite of competition and efficiency.

CMMI defenders may argue that some models have “worked,” but this ignores a critical flaw in the program’s design. Most CMMI models have been voluntary, meaning only providers who were already positioned to succeed opted in. Hospitals and clinics that expected to lose money simply didn’t participate. The result was that the government mostly ended up paying bonuses to already-efficient providers, with little actual change in system-wide spending.

I will be shedding no tears for CMMI’s demise. Like so many other D.C. bureaucracies, it sounds nice on paper but has functioned as little more than a money pit—one that funnels resources away from patient care and into the pockets of middle management and the bureaucratic class. CMMI was supposed to drive innovation. Instead, it has driven up costs, added layers of red tape, and accelerated consolidation while failing at its primary mission of reducing Medicare spending. Its elimination isn’t a loss. It’s an overdue correction.
