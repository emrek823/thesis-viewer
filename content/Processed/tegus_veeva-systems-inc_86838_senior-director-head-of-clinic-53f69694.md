# Veeva Systems Inc - Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
## Interview conducted on April 04, 2024

### Topics
Pharmaceutical, Clinical Systems, EDC, CTMS, Pricing Strategies, Customer Feedback, Competitive Landscape

### Summary
The Tegus Client spoke with the Senior Director/Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead to gather information about their experience with Veeva products. Gilead has extensive experience with five different modules and uses Veeva for regulatory and quality, but not for safety. The implementation of Veeva EDC took longer than expected, but has been smooth since deployment. Gilead has individual contracts for different modules and the estimated annual spend for the clinical module is around $10-12 million, while quality and regulatory are around $15 million each. The Senior Director explains that the cost difference between modules is due to Gilead not using all of the clinical modules yet, but they plan to eventually use everything, which would increase the cost to over $20 million. Quality is more mature and established, leading to higher costs, while regulatory has an opportunity for growth. Gilead has not decided on Veeva for regulatory modules yet. The Senior Director mentions that Gilead has yet to fully explore all the modules and that multiple factors play into their decision-making process. They are open to exploring other options if the technology is not serving its purpose, but are currently happy with Veeva. The Senior Director expresses concerns about the pricing model for Veeva, as they are paying for technology and services they do not fully utilize. They also mention duplicated expenses due to costs for CROs that use the technology. The Senior Director emphasizes the need for cost-efficient options and mentions that they would consider changing products if a better solution with better pricing is available. The expert discusses two major issues with Veeva: their failure to consider user input in their roadmap and their focus on CRO needs over sponsor needs. The sponsor's voice is not being heard and they are paying for a product that does not meet their needs, resulting in the need for internal patching. Another issue is Veeva's limitation on the number of environments, restricting the sponsor's ability to customize the product. The expert mentions that there are no good alternatives for CTMS and eTMF currently, but Oracle and Medidata are being considered for future evaluation. The decision will depend on meeting their needs and cost.

### Expert Details
Senior Director at Gilead Sciences, Inc

Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead.

Prior, the expert was the Head of IT Global Clinical Operations at Biogen Inc., September, 2022.

### Tegus Client
Hello and thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. So what we're trying to understand a little better is like the Veeva Clinical Suite and understanding of the way that the R&D business could grow from here, what the market opportunity is across the different modules.
The modules you use your experience with them, why you have or haven't added others. I mean all that stuff will be really helpful. So I think we just take it piece by piece, but really just trying to understand from a customer's perspective here, what the market map looks like and how you'd think about the journey across these products over time. So could you just give me your quick like 30 seconds in your own words background experience with Veeva products in the clinical side of the business?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Yes, absolutely. I'm the Head of the Clinical Systems team in our organization, and we have multiple different products within our organization, mainly the Clinical Vault and the products within them. In my previous organization, I also led the clinical vault as well. So that's where primarily my experience and my direct use comes in.

### Tegus Client
What was your prior firm that you were at, just for my reference?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
So is the CRO organization PPD.

### Tegus Client
And then when you say just on Clinical Vault, what I at least get a little tripped up on the terms, what modules are you using in there? And what are the main products that you're, I know sometimes they sell like the whole thing and sometimes they sell like piece by piece.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Yes. So there's five different modules that I have pretty extensive experience with TMS, CTMS, Study Start Up, EDC as well. I know it's not part of the Clinical Suite itself, but EDC and payments.

### Tegus Client
Yes. Got it. So Study Start-up, EDC, TMS, payments, you said five, I think I missed one.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
eTMF.

### Tegus Client
So you've got the big three clinical ones, the EDC, eTMF, CTMS and then you guys are also using the start-up and payments modules.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Yes.

### Tegus Client
I was afraid, I would forgot to ask. So go ahead.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
That's what primarily where I come in as all of the clinical operations and some of the preclinical tasks are part of my work and these products are helping us kind of navigate through them. Again, not all products are here in our current organization. That's my general experience when it comes to the products itself, but there's only some of them that are currently used in our company today.

### Tegus Client
Maybe it's outside of your purview with clinical or not, I'm not sure. But do you guys use regulatory or study, but safety quality? Or do you go to a different vendor for that?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
We do have regulatory and quality in our space. Safety is a small user but not as big as clinical or regulatory or quality.

### Tegus Client
So you guys use Veeva for regulatory and quality also?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Yes. So currently, we are going through a project for regulatory, but quality is pretty well established, yes.

### Tegus Client
And you said safety, do you guys use someone else for that, if I heard correctly?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Yes. There are multiple other products out there that we're using multiple different combinations of them. There is some use of Veeva in that space, but we do have other products out there in our company that we're using.

### Tegus Client
And I mean, are you guys using like Oracle, ARRIS? Or is it more like smaller point solution specialists?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
More niche technology, not Oracle products.

### Tegus Client
That's very helpful and I think will be a good level setting for just making sure I ask you questions that are relevant. So I appreciate the background. Maybe we could start with the big three clinical apps, like how I guess, with EDC, when did you implement that?
And what were you using before? How did the product experience compare? Maybe you could just talk me through what you used to have when you switch to Veeva, what the experience has been since, how you feel the products stack up with each other, that sort of thing is maybe just a background.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
So again, not here in the company today, but other company when we had to move from EDC perspective, we used to have Medidata. There's a lot of challenges with from a product standpoint in terms of integration and also working with CRO. EDC was typically the challenging part of it because everybody has their own EDC and trying to get to our EDC because obviously, it needs to flow into other systems like CTMS in terms of the data flow and the activities that we need to do from our clinical operation standpoint.
We also had challenges with maintaining different links in different forms and different templates for each of these organizations. We didn't have a standard process that would say, hey, this is EDC data consistently will be coming in, in this format, in this fashion, these are the data points here so how the data model is going to look like. That has been heavily customized in the organization that made maintenance operations a lot harder, but primarily integration is even harder because we need to look at it case by case when we have to establish that with CTMS.
So that was the second challenging part of it, which when we did the assessment, we looked at the market and the industry and one of the things we were looking at. And by that time, we already had Veeva eTMF in our space. So it made sense for us to switch to Veeva EDC. And that decision was made, I think, 2.5 years ago, if I'm not mistaken.
And after the EDC implementation, during the Veeva implementation, we had several challenges ourselves in terms of how different these two systems are, the processes and the operations. So it took us a little longer than anticipated for the implementation of it. Actually, we went four months or 4.5 months more longer than what we have planned in terms of the implementation aspects of it.
Once it has been deployed, it has been pretty smooth. We did have a few issues, but nothing dramatic or major that stopped our operations and our adaptability of that systems per se. So let me take a quick pause there so if you have any specific question around that journey.

### Tegus Client
Yes. And so just to clarify, your experience with Medidata was in PPD and you're talking about when you switched, while you were at PPD versus Gilead today?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
So my two previous companies, one was Biogen, and one was PPD. So this was at Biogen and prior to that, I was at PPD.

### Tegus Client
Sorry, just to clarify, which of those companies used Veeva of the three of Gilead, PPD and Biogen, you just said at a prior firm, I just wanted to understand, it sounded like it was the CRO experience. I just wanted to clarify that.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Yes. So it's a CRO experience PPD.

### Tegus Client
So implementation took longer than you thought. It sounds like maybe to summarize the Medidata experience like the product was challenging, technology is old, required a lot of integrations and like it's super customized. So like you just got very expensive to maintain.
And at some point you guys did the math on the like the implementation cost to switch systems. I imagine that's not cheap. But nonetheless, it seems like you guys thought that would save you time money moving forward. And so you made the switch, is that fair summary?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Yes.

### Tegus Client
For a pharma company like Gilead, do you guys have an enterprise level style agreement with Veeva? Or are you paying a la carte for these services? And how much do you spend a year on your EDC and your various clinical modules?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
It all depends, again, depending on which company we're talking about. Initially, we started individual technologies because that made more sense for us. We were heavy users of Veeva at that point. So it makes sense to use that for that particular technology licensing and so on. But in our current organization, we have multiple modules that are in place. So we do contracts combined.
So we do have a MSA with Veeva, but at an enterprise level what we still do them by suites, we don't combine everything, meaning quality and clinical, we don't have a contract together. But if we have a module in clinical, we combine them together. So we have that clinical suite cost and EAM and anything else that needs to come with it. We do that, but we don't have a contract at an enterprise level that combines all different modules in our space today.

### Tegus Client
Understood. And what order of magnitude would you say the clinical MSA is on what order of magnitude of spend per year? Is it a mid-single-digit million-dollar number like $20 million? Just help me size that.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
If clinical, we are looking at somewhere around $10 million to $12 million.

### Tegus Client
How about on the other.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
What was the question?

### Tegus Client
No, no, please. No, if you were going to elaborate, please do. I apologize.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
No, I just want to say I say $10 million to $12 million. The reason I say that is we're exploring another product as we speak. So it's not in there yet, if I'm taking only the current use and, I would say, $10-ish million, I think that's our annual price.

### Tegus Client
Got it. And so for quality and regulatory, where you're also regulatory you're sort of an in-process user. But when those are ramped, about how much spend a year do you think that would be?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Well, it's I think quality is somewhere over $15 million, if I'm not mistaken, $15 million-ish and regulatory is around the same $12 million to $15 million. I know they're starting, so they've already started the licenses combined with other things, I think they're also around the $12 million to $15 million-ish.

### Tegus Client
And so clinical, you're saying on the order of like 10 to 12. I'm surprised to hear that quality is so much more than clinical given that you guys are big that you're using the large modules in clinical. Can you maybe talk me through like how? Because if I understand it correctly, clinical is priced.
Well, I guess if you're at an enterprise level for these bundles like you're just agreeing to a price. But I sort of understood clinical to be derived on more of like a per-site basis, quality and regulatory being more like a per person like per seat basis, sort of like underpinning what that MSA should be.
So I just would have assumed like a big company, you guys would be spending maybe more on sites and trials and things like that than quality. But maybe you could talk me through what those, like kind of just like the rough drivers of those numbers and how you think they might grow or not over time?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
I think the reason for that cost in difference is primarily because we're not using all of the modules in clinical today. We only have two. And we will be growing. If we're using everything in the suite, then we would be somewhere over $20 million, $25 million easy from our overall licensing cost per se, but we're not there yet.
We're just starting to add another CTMS module to our project, and that will be at least a two-year journey before we consider adding anything else just because it takes that long for us to implement, adapt and have that business change management in place, but we're not introducing too many products too quickly that it takes a longer time to grow into our space.
So usually, in just about any companies that have been, we don't try to introduce the entire suite into the organization all of the same time we try to adapt one module at a time. So maybe if you ask me this question three years from now, that cost will dramatically change to $20 million, $25 million easy.
So that's the reason why quality has been adapting Veeva products for a little while, at least longer than clinical has been. And that's why their cost is high because they're well established. They're using multiple products, and they do have a good user community as well within the organization. So that's the reason why there is a cost difference.

### Tegus Client
And so quality being more mature, like using the example you just gave, like today, clinical is like 10, but it could be 20, 25 if you were using all that products. Like today, quality is 15. Like where does that stack up relative to like what it might be, would you characterize 15 as pretty full spend for quality?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
I would say so, again, I'm not a quality expert, and I don't manage that organization, but I think they're in a pretty mature state in their point, at least from what I understand, but I'm speculating at this point.

### Tegus Client
Totally fine. Yes. No. So speculation even if it's fine by me. So that's all good. And for regulatory, I don't know if you have a similar sort of like high level view?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
I think there are opportunities to grow there. They're adding a module. And I think there will be one more module left, if I'm not mistaken. And I'm not quite sure exactly which one that is, but there is, I think, an opportunity to grow there.

### Tegus Client
And for regulatory specifically, since that's sort of just to clarify, you mentioned that there's some implementation there kind of like ongoing. Is the $12 million to $15 million reflecting like the run rate of all of that stuff? Or is that you've already agreed to purchase or use, but maybe isn't fully implemented? just trying to get a rough sense for like the pricing of the modules and how things scale as the ad products, if that makes sense?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Yes. If that pans out, that might be what the cost may look like by the end of the year potentially, but we haven't decided on Veeva yet at this point. And that's why I gave you that range. But if you're looking for a steady step that would be $10.5 million.

### Tegus Client
And I guess you mentioned like an interest in taking things more slowly, kind of keeping the change management costs to your enterprise like to a minimum. I mean, Gilead's obviously like a very large company, and I'm sure you guys spend a lot of money on these sorts of systems. Like where would you characterize your journey with respect to adopting these products?
Like is that a five-year process where you feel like it probably happens, but we need to take it slowly. We're really interested in all these products. We even have a road map, and we do it if we have infinite resources or is it like we're really not sure we have things that work. We have other vendors that we like. Like could you just characterize for me like maybe where you are on the journey there?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
So I think we have yet to explore all the modules to their extent. There are multiple factors that play into that decision making. One is, obviously, we as a company ready for it that we're not just buying the product just for the sake of buying, but there's actually a value-added I guess, for the company by purchasing that product.
So there's multiple different factors to it, not only just in the journey of buying it. There's maturity either product maturity as well in some areas, they're not as mature as other companies so that plays a factor into our decision-making as well. It would be great if we're able to invest within a platform that is in a single environment that we can manage it.
But at the same time, that's not the only factor going into that decision-making. Again, the value added, what makes our life easy at the end of the day. if it's a whole another product and whole another company, but it's mature and able to meet our needs, then we tend to look that way. We tend to find those technologies. And that's one of the reasons why, like for safety, we have very niche technology within our

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
system.
Some of our custom build and some are very specific products serving a very for specific purpose because some products are not mature enough, and there's a really small market there that has these companies building these products or we, as a company, are building it ourselves. So it all boils down to multiple different factors before we make that decision.
But if let's assume for the sake of this conversation, if we choose, we want to adopt every single product that's out there in the clinical suite. I think five years is a good estimate for us to get there in order for us to look at the entire clinical suite, including EDC and others in the next five years for us to kind of adopt that because that would give us two years for CTMS, 1.5 years versus Study Start-up and potentially EDC in that journey, maybe not in that quarter, but probably in that journey that might make sense.

### Tegus Client
I guess, like thinking about like the switching costs here are extremely high, for EDC as an example. It sounds like you went through the transition with Medidata. And like maybe there were some hiccups, but it all kind of worked out. Is there anything that some of these other, like I'm going to call them legacy vendors just like for sake of terminology.
Is there anything they could do to refresh their product that would get you to leave Veeva? Or is there something that could happen with Veeva that would get you to leave the clinical suite that you're using today? Or are you happy with it? And as long as there was no major data hiccup or something that you'd be a happy ongoing user?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
So actually, it's a very good question. We, as a company, are looking at already because we're starting to see some patterns within Veeva are very familiar with other companies that have done in the past, which made us leave those companies in the first place, and Veeva is heading into the same path.
I would say absolutely, I don't see, for us when we try to look at technology in the business operation, my goal at the end of the day is how am I making my companies and my company users' life easier. We shouldn't be like attached to a technology if the technology is not serving its purpose, then yes, absolutely, we would move to a legacy vendor and see what improvements they have made that might make our life easier at the end of the day.
It boils down to what Veeva can do in terms of, one, keeping their customers happy, keeping the cost low, improving the product in its state that they need to. But there's always a point if you take Oracle, for an example, ten years ago, I was a heavy user of Oracle, used it, we customized it, we build the products, and we did a lot of things with some technologies then they were the industry fleet back then for several products, not just only CTMS, but analytics and others.
And that scale ticked pretty quickly for a reason. And I see Veeva heading in that same direction, which there will be that tipping scale. There might be somebody else, there might be another company who they might have better ideas in terms of platform solutions and technology solutions, which is the reason why I said we haven't made a decision to move to all Veeva clinical vaults in this suite.
Because we're going to pressure test that at every single product just because we have these couple of products we're not just going to add more products from Veeva. Yes, from an operational maintenance standpoint, it might make sense, but that's not our goal. We need to make sure that we have our focus on delivering what the company needs, delivering what our users need. And that's what our decision will be primarily based off of.

### Tegus Client
And I would love to dive deeper on this. So let's take like EDC as an example, assuming that, that applies here or if it doesn't pick a product does apply to. But what is Veeva doing like more specifically around like what are the problems you're experiencing? And what would motivate you to evaluate Medidata or installing Medidata here?

Page 7 of 13

### Tegus Client
Like could you just talk me through that? I just want to get more detail on the high level, like seeing some similar patterns versus other vendors you've used in the past that did lose share. What are those patterns? What are they doing? How are they addressing them, et cetera?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Absolutely. I can give you a few examples on some few scenarios that we're already seeing with Veeva. So take a sponsor company like us, where we partner a lot with CROs, we contracted out. We either adopt their services. But we have a very different ways of operations than a CRO would. They will be heavy users of the technology compared to a sponsor; they may not have that extensive use of that technology.
So we're paying for their people, they're paying for their services, we're paying for their technology. And we're duplicating that cost in our company because we need that technology in our space as well, but we're not that heavy users of that.
We don't have the same number of users, the same number of studies, but our price model is the same because Veeva tend to charge you for the licenses based on your R&D spend, which is not a fair deal for a sponsor, and that's one of the huge concerns that being hearing, not just only within my company, but my peers and the other organizations as well. And that may drive people to say what are the other cost-efficient options that will help us achieve the same goals but in a different product. So that's one example.

### Tegus Client
Sorry, just before we go to the next example, I would love just to ask a quick clarifying question on this. Let's take that you're partnering with a CRO and you both use Veeva for your EDC. You're paying at an enterprise level to have it, let's say, the CRO is like an enterprise partner, too, and so are they. Your contention here is basically just like the CRO, whether or not it's directly billed to you or not is like passing through that overhead?
Or is it that the CRO is explicitly billing you for using that EDC technology.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
So regardless of what system they use as the CRO, we have a technology cost built into it. If they're using Medidata, they're using Veeva, it doesn't really matter. We have a technology cost when we do a contract with because we need the data back and they need to put this data somewhere, so they put it into their EDC, their CTMS, whatever that solution technology we're talking about.
And then they have a data cost to it as well because they are giving us that data to us at the end of the day. So we have multiple layers of that cost in our contract when we partner with CROs. So in that situation, based on the R&D cost, if you take a look at it, that spend is not directly going into our technologies. We're spending it outside of our organization. There's a technology cost included.
So I don't know how you want to call it direct or indirect. It's part of our contract with the CRO costs that we know that we're paying for it, and we are duplicating that cost because we are paying for our own EDC for internal use. Again, that's a small use compared to what our CRO partners who are paying for that as well.
So the concern, at least from some of us and from peers in the organization is it's not the services and our contract and/or the product is not built for a sponsor. It's built for a CRO. It's all contracted out to CROs. They do it in their system, we don't use it. There are several features and functionalities like that as a sponsor.
We don't use them because they are contracted out to a CRO. They have a full use of the technology. So when they're paying that full price, it might make sense for them because they are taking full advantage of the product and services that are coming with CTMS. When we are using CTMS, we are not using in its full capacity.
We're using it for very specific reasons. We might have late-phase studies that we're doing it in a very specific way that doesn't use everything will module. When we have interventional studies, Phase I and Phase II, they are done very differently. They're using very specific modules. We're not using end-to-end based on how Veeva built the product. But we're paying for all of that. It's not built based on how many

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
modules you're using.

### Tegus Client
I understand. Maybe if you don't mind, I'd like to just try to say back to you. I think there's a few different pieces of what you're pointing out, which are all very interesting. So one is that you're paying an MSA level price for a heavyweight system that fully functional for IQVIA maybe been not for you. I mean IQVIA doesn't use Veeva bad example.
But for you guys, you don't use all the modules. So you're sort of paying like full freight for a system that you use like a fraction of. So that's sort of like one pricing issue there. Maybe you could sum up all these is they're expensive and they're like hidden ways that they're charging you. But one way is that the service itself is expensive versus what you can use.
The second way is that in your company's R&D spend, which is what drives your MSA price, you're already including in that spend to CROs that have this technology and use it. And so that's sort of like the gripe here. Is that fairly summarized?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Yes, I think so.

### Tegus Client
And so when you say you're looking to explore more cost-efficient options, actually one more question on this one. And then I'd like you to go through your other examples first. Maybe we'll take on after you do that, like who is well positioned to address these concerns.
But you said like other peers of yours are not happy with this. Are these existing users of Veeva or folks that just like won't adopt it because it's expensive and they see the dynamic is just like unfair?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
So again, it all depends. So when we need to make a decision to say, okay, we're going to use a different payment solution that's not Veeva. It's not something that quality or regulatory has a say in it. It's primarily all of that decision comes from the clinical team because we use the product, and it impacts us at the end of the day.

### Tegus Client
Just to clarify, I appreciate the dynamic you explained around quality, regulatory and clinical like all having their own separate MSA. But I'm assuming that the price you're paying is benefiting from the bundle. Is that not correct?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Not true.

### Tegus Client
Got it.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
So there is a bundle option, but it's not always cost efficient even in that situation as well. So is the pricing a driving factor, absolutely. Everybody has a budget, and everybody has to stick with it. If we're not able to find a solution within that budget that does impact our company finances as well at the end of the day. That's a pretty significant difference that we have to explain to our leadership, why we need to continue to maintain that particular product.

### Tegus Client
I understand.

So when we look at any of these products, they are not based on a decision to say, hey, we started the Veeva contract. They're all evaluated individually. And when it comes down to cost, we do look at the bundle option to say if I have three of these products, is it giving me everything that I'm looking for from a use case requirement prospective at the same time is it fitting into my budget. So all of those conversations have to happen in order for us to make a decision.
So let's say, tomorrow, we look at payment options. But their payment solution is not mature. It's a very basic level payments, but for clinical site payments, they are very complex. There are so many scenarios, so many use cases to think about and how to manage that within the organization in overall clinical finance that needs to come together, that's a whole another complex monster use case that will come together and Veeva payments product is not mature to handle that.
So we need to ask ourselves the question, is that the right product for us to invest or do we go with other vendors who are in the market, they're very niche technology. They're built very specifically for this purpose, and they don't have any other products. And it might make sense for us to say, hey, they're the same cost, but I'm getting a better product there compared to here.
So we need to weigh in multiple different levels. It's not just only a cost, but if it boils down to, I'm getting the same product, but I can get one for a lower cost in some places. Absolutely, we will evaluate that and see if that's a best solution for us moving forward, if that saves us a couple of million dollars a year.

So you would evaluate changing. I assume the example we just talked about like what apply to like EDC, CTMS, eTMF, like you would evaluate changing those products based on the complaint you just registered?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Absolutely. If you asked me 10 years ago, people would have said, "absolutely not. There is no better system out there other than Oracle CTMS, but things are changing. It's always going to change. There's always going to be something better on the market, and we're just not going to shy away from exploring that if we have better use case, better system, better pricing that we can explore absolutely.

### Tegus Client
I know we went on a bit of a loop there, but that was helpful in clarifying a lot of things for me, so I appreciate it. If you recall, your train from like 10 or 15 minutes ago, you mentioned this one particular headache with Veeva. What you were starting to head down a path to talk about some other ones. Maybe I'll let you lay them all out first and then we can ask the clarifying questions afterwards just to let you kind of get your thoughts down.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Sure. So I know we're getting close on time here. So I will give you another example, which is a road map. It's a very interesting conversation with products like Veeva. And this is something similar to what we have seen with Oracle as well. They failed to take users' input into the road map.
Because they were very focused on what they want to drive the product instead of considering what the users for the product needs, and they quickly lost sight of it. And it's one of those things where you do not want to take that portion out of it. At the same time, I know Veeva does have a large user group, and they cannot satisfy everybody's request, that's not their concern.
Having said that, there are some valid product concerns that people have been struggling and we have been establishing other solutions, customizing the product and Veeva is now catching up to it several years later, it does drive us to look for other products too because when we invested in Veeva, they were growing fast, they were improving fast, but they're not doing that fast anymore.
They slowed down dramatically in terms of their road map. They have stopped or reduced their interactions with the users on their pain points, how to help them, how to address some of their concerns within the

product itself, innovating to, again, would a sponsor needs to what a CRO needs. They're weighing in a lot on CRO side of the functionality, which is causing a disadvantage to sponsor that they would roll out a feature in an R1 and R2, but we have zero value for it.
And it's like, okay, we can just turn that feature off and we'll just move on to other things that are more pressing for us. So they need to start thinking about how to balance that. So they're not deploying changes that are only CRO-centric, CRO impactful. They also need to think about sponsors because they do have a large CRO organizations that they're supporting. It would be good for them to start thinking about how to have a sponsor-specific upgrades they need to make to the product so that they are in that continuous evaluation of the product.
And now they're not on the top of the chain anymore because everybody else started to look for elsewhere or they start to customize the products, build their own. So all of those are good possibilities to happen with Veeva if they don't try to balance between CRO needs and sponsor needs to build into their core product itself.

### Tegus Client
So it sounds like you guys feel like, particularly as a sponsor, voice is not really being heard in terms of the product road map. And these two issues sound like they would feed on each other in the sense that you're paying a CRO price for a CRO product that's being maintained and upgraded for CROs, but not really for your own needs.
And so that's resulted in you having to do internal patching and other like brake fix type work on your own, which makes the sort of the simplicity of the product that you highlighted like early in the call, like it sort of defeats that purpose a little bit because you've got a lot of like integrations and things you have to do to solve problems that aren't being dealt with by the company.

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Exactly.

### Tegus Client
So I guess any other major ones besides these two?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
I think from the road map and actually, there's one more example that I can give you is a recent change they made last year with the environment. So I don't know if you know this, but they have limited every suite to seven environments. And you have to stay within that. If you need an eighth environment, you have to buy more environments and there's a different price ranging from small to extra-large where it can cost you $25,000 a month to maintain that environment for you.
Which, to me, is a step against customer service and customer success because, well, if you're taking environments away and limiting them, then it limits what we can do within our product itself. So one, you're not taking our road map needs into consideration and not building it into the product now limiting the products would limit our POCs, our ability to make the changes ourselves within any environment.
On top of it, you have Veeva releases and everything. So it's going to be very hard for us to manage multiple different products within seven environments. It's absolutely not reasonable at all for us to maintain. Everybody in our organization right now is looking at adding more environments. And I'm sure that's as good news for Veeva because now it's getting more out of the companies from a cost perspective, but it's a step taken against customer success because now you're limiting what I can do within the system.
You're limiting my ability to meet my customer needs because I have very limited environment, adding more budget to our spend already when we think the existing cost itself is expensive. Now this is an additional cost that's adding to our expense. So things like that, I don't know how much thought process went into it when they make these changes. If this is a way limiting customers do not customize their product, then again, it's not helping us at the end of the day in ensuring that we're using the product to the full extent.

And with the last couple of minutes that we have, I would love to know who is positioned well. And in particular, on the big clinical modules, I imagine that some of these are a little more fungible than others, but EDC and CTMS, like these are big systems that you would not make the change lightly. And so for those if these issues were not resolved, like who else would you explore and why?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
Could you repeat that question? I don't think I followed. When you say you, if they're not.

### Tegus Client
Sorry, you just brought up, I think, like three really good like examples of what would make the using Veeva challenging or give you a negative customer experience. Presumably, like they could address these and make you a happier customer. But if they don't, and you're saying you're interested. These are all sufficient in your mind to like to level up the concern of using their products on an enterprise-wide basis and maybe even cause you to consider changing like an EDC system.
Who are the other providers that you think are doing this stuff well? Like when you talk to your peers that are current Veeva users, and you mentioned that they're also dissatisfied. Who are you talking about when you're saying we should stop using Veeva, we should call Medidata. The product has its issues, but at least it's cheaper and they don't double charge-offs like this?
Who would you sub Veeva out for across the key products you're using? Because Oracle, you mentioned nobody seems to like Oracle and they've had a lot of legacy issues. I've heard negative things about people's customer experience with Medidata as well. Is Veeva like the worst of the best or the best of the worst is one way to ask it?
Or are there other like viable alternatives or new point solutions that are being grown that might be better options. Just like help me understand the competitive alternative set for you across your key major clinical suite?

### Senior Director / Head of Clinical Systems at Gilead
I think at this very moment, like for CTMS and even eTMF, I don't think there good competitive out there. I know Oracle bought the goBalto, but that's more of a steady startup than TMF, in my opinion. So I know Oracle is coming up with the TMF, I know that, but I don't know when that's coming in? Is it this year or next year? But that something we would look forward to when it does roll out.
From an EDC perspective, we're still in contact with Medidata.. I don't know when and what they will come out. But I don't think I can give you and say, "Hey, this is one particular CTMS that we want to go forward with. We did evaluate some of the industry trends, like Intrinsic was one of them.
If you're into like Excel and Word documents that you want easily import and export, that was one of those technologies we evaluated a couple of years ago. And Medidata has their CTMS as well, although it's not mature enough. But there are other companies that are at a very starting stage, and they're not up there yet to say if I have a choice next month, and I can switch from Veeva to another company.
I don't think there's a name I can give you, but there are companies that are growing and investing into seeing where the market trend and industry trends and concerns are going, they're trying to build it into the product. So it might be a year or two before that comes out, but I don't think I can give you just one name.

### Tegus Client
If I can sum up what you just said is Oracle is working on a TMF product, when it launches, you'll be interested to evaluate in Medidata, you would need to see some upgrades to the product given your prior experience, but it sounds like they want to address those. And if they do, you'd be interested there too.
I mean I think you answered my question. I wasn't necessarily looking for like one particular company, just there are viable alternatives at least theoretically, on the road map and Veeva is not the only game in town.

Yes. At least, I mean we are considering Veeva for sure. It primarily depends on who is able to meet our needs, and that could be the business operations or that could be cost.
All different factors will go into it to ensure that we're getting the right product in our company, and it's not merit to just think, we were putting a product. We have a thorough evaluation process and ROI process before we make that decision.

### Tegus Client
Very helpful. Like I said, I appreciate your patience. I apologize for being late, but I hope you have a good one.
