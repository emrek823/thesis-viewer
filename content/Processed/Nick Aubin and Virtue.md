### Commons Clinic Business Model & AI Impact

- Overall business model - AI cannot dramatically change cost structure; majority of costs are real costs:
	- Physician compensation ($1M/surgeon)
	- Surgery center implants
	- Staffing costs ($40-50k/staff) are meaningful but smaller
- Getting rid of 10% staff isn’t economically compelling, but valuable due to quality issues
- Quality problem focus - not clinical quality, but quality of work
- Critique of cost-saving pitches: “Do you think my front desk person only does one thing? No, you’re a YC idiot”

### Healthcare AI Applications

- AI scribe implementation:
	- Doesn’t save money directly
	- Accelerates physician note closing, driving revenue velocity
	- Key insight: “You can’t teach good rates” - contracts matter most
- PPM (Physician Practice Management) dynamics:
	- In highly compensated specialty care, leverage comes from:
		- Physician compensation reduction over time
		- Launching ancillaries and new revenue streams
		- Cost synergies (though staff reduction often worsens practice)
	- Specialty services challenge: ratio of AI-able staff isn’t where biggest costs lie
	- Example: Cardiology - replacing staff saves some money, but launching imaging generates significant revenue

### Lower-Skilled Healthcare Segments

- Home health / ABA characteristics:
	- Relatively unskilled clinicians with high turnover
	- Commodity labor with massive documentation burden
	- Better scaling economics and cost leverage in roll-ups
	- Numbers become more material as provider entity scales

### Three Key Market Theses

- Enterprise Opportunity:
	- Similar to SmarterDX approach
	- Focus on real scale, real problems
	- Attack from enterprise perspective
- Platform vs Point Solutions:
	- Need for healthcare-specific ERP
	- Build different with AI stack
	- Expanding buyer base
	- More value-based entities and new providers
- Provider Roll-ups/Workflows:
	- Critical of Function/Ezra approaches (“garbage experiences”)
	- Shoot out AI solutions with minimal clinical oversight
	- Common misunderstanding of malpractice constraints
	- Example: CareStyntax CTO pitch for AI-enabled mid-level procedures rejected due to regulatory/practical issues

### Voice Technology Implementation

- AssortReplicant evaluation
- Need for “Dialpad for Healthcare” with native AI voice
- Value breakdown:
	- 80% from Dialpad functionality
	- 15% voice from Eleven Labs
	- 5% content/workflow management
- Assort implementation process:
	- Content collection via spreadsheet
	- Code base implementation
	- Eleven Labs integration
