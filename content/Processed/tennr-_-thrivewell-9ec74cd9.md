# Tennr - Senior Operations Specialist at Thrivewell Infusion, LLC
Interview conducted on April 24, 2025

## Topics
AI Tools, Data Entry, Referral Process, Product Development, Human in the Loop, Return on Investment, Benefits Investigation, Workflow Automation

## Summary
A medical practice operating as an MSO discussed their experience implementing AI tools to automate and streamline operations, focusing on the referral and intake process. They chose Tennr over Mandolin due to its advanced development and customization capabilities. The implementation process began in August with a phased-out approach for thorough planning and testing. Tennr's live analytics tool and recent AI functions for document identification were highlighted as key milestones. The Tegus Client inquired about potential future spend and new features like the qualifications worker, mentioning areas for improvement like a more interactive system of record and a live dashboard. The expert suggested Tennr could improve by focusing on task management within the referral process and recommended assigning tasks to different teams. They rated their likelihood to recommend Tennr as a nine out of ten, praising the company for delivering what was asked for and helping streamline processes without the need to hire additional staff.

## Client
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about AI tools to automate and streamline different operations in healthcare, specifically Tennr. To start off, could you please give me a quick overview of your background and experience?

## Expert
Yes. My background personally, I've worked in healthcare administration for about 10 years now. I was in a large hospital system then I shifted and helped to scale a number of mental health centers across New York state. About two years ago, started working with Thrivewell Infusion, which provides infusion services for patients with rare and chronic diseases that need to get advanced biological medications that varies across the industry.

We have like 90 meds in our portfolio. We're not like a med spa or anything like that. We actually are a medical practice and we operate as an MSO on top of that. In terms of what we were doing, pretty much Thrivewell was having a few concerns and issues. We have an EMR that we utilize. What I saw when I came in was I did an analysis of the whole entire practice and how it was operating, and what I was finding was that there was a ton of duplicate data entry.

People were having manually to go through faxes. It was taking forever to create a chart, get things set up, and our intake process was not sufficient within the EMR that we were using. I helped to streamline that front end and then really was looking for some different AI technologies that would enhance that and see if we could shorten the time frame because we were also scaling super quickly.

We're in five states, we will be in nine states by the end of the year, and we are over 30-something locations. While this rapid growth period was happening over the last year and a half, instead of having to hire in a ton more staff, I was looking into different AI solutions that would save us from having to bring on more talent and also help to streamline and optimize our workflows so we could have less duplicate data entry.

## Client
Makes perfect sense. When you talk about the intake process, because I assume all of your customers or clients come through referrals, is that true? Is it like 100% of your clients are coming through referrals?

## Expert
Yes. 100% of our clients come through referrals.

## Client
Is that the area that you were experiencing the highest pain points in, in terms of length of time that it took and the inaccuracy that you're referring to, just seeing wrong data being entered? Was that the highest priority area or how are you thinking?

## Expert
The highest priority for us was being able to scale and manage the volume that was coming in. It wasn't so much not having to add more people and being able to make sure that we could streamline and get that in as quickly as possible, because the amount of time it takes to process those new referrals that come in directly impacts the amount of time it takes from when the patient's journey begins to when they can actually be seen and treated.

In order to not have to add five or six people to that team and expand the size of that team, we were able to instead utilize Tennr, and have one person managing it and then get through something that took 25 minutes previously in about 30 seconds to three minutes. It really helps us on the front end.

They've also been helpful with a number of other pieces. They've been able to integrate directly into our Excel sheets and also into our EMR to actually create patient charts so that we don't have to do that manually anymore. As it's reviewing the documents that come in, when it is a referral, it will actually pull out that information.

We built-in touch points because obviously with clinical information, we wanted to be certain that it's correct. They have accuracy checkers, but we wanted a human in the loop for those elements. It was very customizable with them how we built out our architecture and they spent the time with us on the front end of the work to really understand, "Okay, here's our process, and here's what we would like to do. We want people to be involved here. When it's just a document that we want uploaded and we don't want anyone to have to do that part, we'll have that part be automated."

The team that we had worked with them, we were assigned three people from their team. One was an engineer, one was like a case manager in a way, or customer relations manager. We also have someone who helps us to overview our analytics and just make sure that we're satisfied with the product. Those three people had worked together to really optimize us across the start of how we were going to build out the architecture. We've actually gone live about a month and a half ago.

## Client
In your evaluation process, what other companies did you look at? Were you only looking at tools that will automate the referral and intake process or also just looking at broader AI tools? Can you maybe just go over that and what the company.

## Expert
We also evaluated Mandolin, which is another product. I felt personally that Tennr was further along in the development of their product. They had an actual platform which you can log into. They were able to show us a live demo. Their team felt like it was larger and more available to meet our needs. When we prospected with Mandolin, they were still showing us screenshots of the software. It felt a little bit like it was a thought and it needed to still be built out.

They weren't able to give us examples of workflows that they've seen before. That was one of the reasons why we didn't move forward with them. They offer a variety of services. They have the same fax wrangling, but then they also do BI. They also do other automations. I think they're connected with authorizations. We've looked at SambaCare, which is an authorization AI platform. I think it's called Invictus, which also does phone call benefits investigations.

We evaluated a number of other products, and to be honest, we felt that the range that Tennr offered, even though it seems like it's just the front-end wrangling that they're doing for you when you're looking at the income of referral, they actually built out a lot of other workers within there for us. We wanted a fax to go back to the providers to confirm referral was received. They were able to do that and they're able to pull zip files for us and build in these things that we needed and integrate within our spreadsheets and our team's chats.

That has been really helpful because those are more than just reviewing documents there. It's actually getting into drafting a web, drafting an email and then forwarding an email to us so that our team doesn't have to constantly create these emails to kickstart the initiative within our workflow. They've done a number of things that were really customized to what our build out was that are not just receiving the referral.

## Client
That's really helpful. You weren't necessarily only looking to automate the referral process, but it sounds like that was the most important area to automate and Tennr was doing that and also were able to build-out some tools to automate other kind of manual processes, it sounds like. Is that the right way to think about it?

## Expert
Yes. We're always looking at new technologies in the space to see what they have to offer. I think we also looked at Denial. An AI denial software that reviews and helps you to write appeal letters. The owner was this guy named Corey. I'm always evaluating what's out there in the market, but sometimes you get over-promise, I feel. Can it actually deliver? The way our business is set up, some of these tools are built for very streamlined, "Okay, I'm totally in network." If all your T's and I's are crossed and dotted, in reality that's not necessarily how the business is operating.

If the tool wasn't going to be completely reliable, I feel like with our team it wasn't worth bringing forward to C-suite and saying, "Here is this initiative that I think is going to add value because you'd have to have carve-outs and it's only helping parts of the team." We've also spoken with Anatomi. We actually use them. They're a mail processor. Physical mail goes to them. I know that they're working on trying to build out some task optimization in there, but still from what I saw from them, Tennr seems much further along in their development.

## Client
Were any of the other tools that you evaluated also had a solution for the referral process?

## Expert
Yes. Mandolin and Tennr. Anatomi was talking about the fact that even though they do mail, they might be able to do the wrangling as well. Those were the primary three that I spoke with.

## Client
How did you specifically find that Tennr solution that was different or better than Mandolin? What made you go with Tennr over Mandolin?

## Expert
Like I said, the demo experience. When they were actually showing us the product, we felt that Tennr was showing us something live and actionable. It felt like it was further developed. That was the primary thing. Also just based off of interactions and what felt like was like genuine. What was actually like, "Do they actually have this? Is it actually producible and will it actually result in success?"

I felt like the Tennr team seemed like it was larger and more bass with more experience. Even though we were the first to use it in the infusion space, they had a number of customers outside of that space, so I felt confident from that. We met them actually at one of the conferences, both companies in person and then demoed with them.

## Client
That's helpful. When did you start working with Tennr to actually implement their solution? What was the timeline there?

## Expert
We started working with them last year in, I believe August, was when we met them. Did we meet them in June and then we signed in August? I want to be clear that the build-out itself. We moved very slow. I feel like anytime we gave an active request, they were on top of what we wanted. It did take time because our workflow it's not linear. We wanted to make sure that we had thought out a lot of the pieces, but it was phased out appropriately. We have been live for at least four months, I think now.

We are finally at the point where we can see backend analytics and data. They have different management tools that we can use. We have been able to assign managers to look over that. Now, they just told us that it should start reporting using its AI function like the worker in the front to identify what the documents are on its own. That just went live for us recently.

## Client
You said the first thing that went live was analytics tool, not the actual AI.

## Expert
No. They have a live analytics tool that we can utilize to see the time that's being saved. It's just another feature that's there. At first, we did an architecture design, so we met with their engineers and we did like, "Okay, here's what we anticipate to be in the build-out," then we went into a testing period for about five months there.

We had two people who were specifically trained to be in there and utilizing it, but they were manually uploading files and we were testing out the back end. After that, we went into having it be live, where it was sorting our documents and sending emails, adding to our spreadsheets and fully functioning.

## Client
Really helpful. How has the experience been so far with the product? How is it being used today? Is it completely automated today or is there still a human in the loop who's checking that all the information is correct?

## Expert
Yes. We wanted a human in the loop, so we built it in that way that it would be that they have to click. They call it the human in the loop. That everything is correct, but the time that they spend has been dramatically reduced. They were doing all that work manually, making a patient's chart in the EMR, drafting an email, adding them to a spreadsheet.

All of those components, like I said at the beginning of the call, are now taking like 30 seconds and it's pulling that data out for them. You can see the percentage of accuracy. The accuracy has gone up over the last month. It's what it's actually identifying for us. It's always been pulling out that information, but she's been confirming it.

We just got an email, I think two weeks ago, where it said that it has been learning for long enough, that now it will start to make recommendations. I don't have the analytics on what the accuracy is with those recommendations, and I don't want to tell you something that is not true. I don't know how accurate the actual worker is just because it just went live like last week. I haven't looked over that yet. In terms of time saved, it's a significant KPI, like increase and an ROI for moving forward with them as a platform.

## Client
Got it. It sounds like what's happening is that it's just automating that data entry process. Is there anything around authorization that's being done today or is that not something that's live?

## Expert
We're not utilizing it for authorization outside of the fact that we push emails that are authorization specific to specific team members based on different insurances, things along those lines, but no, it's not doing any authorization. I don't know that it has that built-in, that capacity to do authorization. It doesn't mean that they may not be able to. I haven't heard them pitch that as a feature to us. More so I've heard them talk about that they have a BI, but we're not using that at this time.

## Client
Got it. In terms of spend, how much are you spending annually on Tennr, and how do you think about your return on investment? You can say mid-high five figures, low six figures.

## Expert
I think that they're billing implementation fee. I think it's based on a quarterly, and I would say it's below six figures.

## Client
Got it. Do you foresee your spend with them increasing over time? Is it tied to referral volume and you see that going up, so spend will also increase, or do you see spend increasing through expanding? As you mentioned, they're building out some new tools. I'm curious how you think about that.

## Expert
Yes. I do think that we will probably have it increased because we are looking into using what's called their qualifications worker, where it will potentially review those orders and then draft out those orders and highlight missing pieces of clinical information, or not even what's missing, just specific pieces from within those documents.

That is a technology that they have that we aren't currently utilizing. We wanted to first see how this platform, this wrangler worked before we moved into that, what they called the qualifications worker. I do think it's something that our team may be interested in over time, so that is a possibility.

Also, I'm pretty sure that it gives you a certain number of faxes sent out and also a certain number of faxes to process in. As we scale, I could see that going up a bit, but those numbers, again, were relative. I also feel like they were workable regarding the cost. They were willing to work with us as customers, and we negotiated with them a bit. From an outside perspective, I think you would probably be able to do the same thing.

## Client
Maybe just to get a sense, in your view, how much do you foresee that spend increasing to? Do you think you would, it would ever get to seven figures, or do you only see it maybe getting to mid-six figures? What's The potential you see with how much you're spending on?

## Expert
I think it depends on our growth trajectory. For right now, I can totally answer. I don't see us stopping to use it. I think that the tool is a great tool. I feel like it will scale as we scale. I don't anticipate it just going up while we're going down in business. As we grow, I anticipate that it would. The cost may increase as our volume increases, but that would be okay based on our return.

Especially if we can keep the number of people that are actually working within the platform low, then we're saving. In our eyes, the way we're doing our ROI is like, "Okay, this is not seven people, 10 people, 15 people that would we need to work to process that many factors, that amount of time." Doesn't matter referrals. The spend, I think it will scale appropriately.

## Client
I know you just went live recently with the product, but are there any areas where you think they can be doing better, areas where the product could be better or even just things that you'd like to see them improve?

## Expert
I do think from my perspective, I would like to see a system of record. I think it comes as a data file right now, which is helpful for my analytics team, but from a viewpoint of management, I'd like to see that be more interactive and I've given them that feedback that their analytics to be able to narrow in to the different cards, they call them cards, in a different way and have alternative views of the completed work would be helpful because as it's processing those files, I'd like to be able to see it differently with the patient attached to the patient's name.

There were some things, but anytime I've made a request, they've been super open to that feedback and they've been building things out. I feel confident that they'll get there, but that is something that I would like to see a little bit more of another view, of the completed work.

## Client
Just so I really understand, right now the way that you're getting this information is like it's being sent in a data file and you just want more of a live dashboard.

## Expert
The actual platform you can go in and you can see the cards. I don't know if you've demoed with them, but the cards move across the tracker as you're completing a task. When the cards get to the end is when they're completed. If you go into that completed list, you can search for different things like authorization this, that, and then you can look at a list of all of those files, but if you wanted to get and hone in a little bit more onto those files or see them in a different way, you'd have to pull it out as raw data.

I would like something that looks a little bit more, from my perspective, can I potentially in the future follow across a patient and see different things, like how many files came in for this one patient over the last six months? I don't think that I have that. I do think you can search by patient's name, but I think it could be more interactive from a UX experience.

## Client
One thing I just wanted to clarify that you mentioned is what exactly Tennr product does. It sounds like from you, part of it is the technology or document processing stuff where they can take this really large PDF and structure the data and put it into a format where you can understand it. Another part is maybe texting the patient, I think you were saying, and automating some of those contacts and then also making sure that the payer is in network. What is the stuff that they do on top of just the time savings from human labor reading a PDF and putting it into a structured format?

## Expert
Sure. I think it's actually not lot different from what you just said. From my perspective of what's actually happening, it is looking through every kind of referral or any kind of incoming message that we're getting. It's not just referrals. If we get scripts, we get billing mail, we get authorization information. Whatever is coming in is all connected and then it will automatically sort all of that out and send it to the appropriate team. That was our original design. With the actual referrals that are new referrals, versus continuity referrals.

It'll actually review the document, it'll pull out the specific pieces of information that are relevant from that document, and then learn what those document types are so that next time it will be more accurate and it can get that information more accurately in the future, and then it will take that and it directly goes in. We built it out that it creates charts within our EMR so we don't have to do that.

## Client
It sounds like it was doing some part of automating the contact with the patient. Is that right?

## Expert
We have a confirmation receipt. We built it out that it will fax back to the referring provider's office saying that we received their information. That was a build out we wanted to add on that they were able to do. They can send faxes back, they can send emails back, they can send emails internally to our teams. We have a process in which whenever that patient is added in and a new chart is created, it gets added onto this manual tracker as well.

It's integrated within our sheet. It goes in and actually reads through the sheet to make sure, and there's logic behind it. Is this patient on this list? Is this patient on this list with a different med? It's using logic there to make sure that is kept accurate. That's a live sheet with 40-something tabs that 10 departments work across.

## Client
It makes a lot of sense. Last quick question is on the new product that you said you were evaluating from them what exactly is that? It sounds like it would check with the payers or something like that. What was that new product that sounds like you're not quite ready to use yet?

## Expert
You're talking about their BI, their benefits investigation tool that they are building. I think they're building out something that if you provide the insurance, I haven't totally demoed it yet, but I know that they presented on it in their quarterly review. It's pretty much like a benefits investigation with the insurance. They'll go in, they'll do automated call to that insurance company, review those benefits that patient has and then return that information with the transcript to you.

## Client
Was there something else that you said you were evaluating from them too?

## Expert
Yes. The qualification worker.

## Client
What is that one?

## Expert
That one is it will actually review the paperwork itself. If you're receiving a medical record, it'll be like, "Okay, this is a DEXA scan." If you're looking for certain lab values, it'll read the document and be like, "Okay, this is this lab value versus this is this," and then it'll pull that information out for you and then be like"This may be missing" or did highlight what is relevant based on the diagnosis code, based on different things like that. That was another thing we were potentially going to build, and then it can actually go into the system and build orders.

## Client
Got it. What ways could Tennr improve? Are there any other products that are like this product, like the qualifications product or something like that that if you were talking to the team, you might tell them to build in?

## Expert
I know that they had other products available, but honestly, I haven't looked at them, so I'm not sure what those workers were from. From our perspective, things that would be helpful, there's still so much on the front end. There's a lot that could be built out in terms of task management. I think a lot of the EMRs and a lot of these systems don't have ways to follow tasks. I think that if they could build something like that, people would be interested in that.

## Client
What kind of tasks?

## Expert
As you're working through the workflow, there's all these different teams that need to be attached to those different stages of a referral process. Once it's done being processed like, "Okay, this is a referral," then you move into "Okay, this needs to have this authorization and what status is it at and who's owning this within that team."

All of those tasks, where it's pending, it could be built out further so that you could follow that patient's journey outside of just the intake and moving into their actual care. The more automation you can do there, the better. I don't know if that makes sense, but more task management.

## Client
Could you be more specific around what actual moving into the patient actual care? Can you give an example of a task, because obviously, that can be very broad, if you can give me an example of a task that you're thinking of.

## Expert
Other tasks that we have is like the sending of infusion notes back to the providers. That could be something that could be easily automated by them. What I was more so talking about was, along the stages of getting them so that they can be seen, there are other steps that are required. Like, has a benefits investigation been completed? Like, being able to push forward those tasks into different teams buckets, and making it like, "Okay, this is where this patient is along the journey."

It going from a file or referral into a card that then is owned, and I can see, "Okay, Person X from my team is working on this patient's BI right now." That was approved, and then now it shifts forward and switches so that our authorization team gets it. As it's been through those stages having it be that those tasks can be assigned rather than outside of the referral process.

## Client
Makes sense. Just last question for me is if you had to rank your likelihood to recommend Tennr on a scale of 1-10, 10 being most likely, what would you say?

## Expert
I would say nine. Honestly, for what we wanted the product to deliver, I feel like it has successfully delivered. I feel like they were easy to work with. They're educated. They've created what we've asked for, and anytime there has been an issue, if it's come about they've found a solution.

To me, so far where we're at in the product, they're a great vendor for us and have helped us to not have to hire at least four people onto a team that was drowning. It's been a great resource. I think they're easy to work with and they're educated in what they're doing. I'm very analytical, so I look at the process and the workflow from the outside in.

They took the time to make sure our clinical team felt safe with the parts that they wanted to have, like human in the loop. They took the time to understand what is the logic behind this, and they worked with us well. I think for what we were looking for, they were a great vendor in terms of like, a full AI solution that does everything. I'm not sure what it is specifically you're looking for, but I do feel that the demands that we created and or the requests that we created, they met that. To me, that's what I can go off of.

I think that if you have own workflow and you understand your process, it was take the time to work it out, to be able to automate your flow and it doesn't have to be specific to what ours is. They have the capability to integrate. They have the capability to understand. They're working with multiple vent. It's not just infusion. The fact that we were the first infusion customer and they were able to create what we wanted, I think was impressive.

## Client
Great. This was helpful. Thank you for your time. Enjoy the rest of your day.
