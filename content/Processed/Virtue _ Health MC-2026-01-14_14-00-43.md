### Customer Relationship Updates

- Gather (mid-year adjustment client)
	- Multiple meetings completed, CEO meeting scheduled post-call
	- Annual subscription + shared upside arrangements being structured
	- Strong alignment from COO and CTO, good prior relationship
- Credo partnership concerns
	- Been fundraising for over a year, may be “circling the drain”
	- Considering ending white-label relationships due to added friction
	- Strategic shift toward direct client relationships only
- Render situation (major setback)
	- President and CIO retired by PE overlords before Christmas
	- Lost institutional knowledge, back to square one with new team
	- External counsel engaged, compliance concerns slowing progress
	- Revenue holes creating urgency but institutional chaos
- Kirana ongoing discussions

### Business Development & Support Needs

- Top priority: More top-of-funnel opportunities
