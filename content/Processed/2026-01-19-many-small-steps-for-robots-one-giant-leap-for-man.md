Hi friends 👋 ,

Happy Thursday! I am thrilled to bring you not boring world’s first co-written essay (cossay? need something here) with my friend **[Evan Beard](https://x.com/evanbeard)**, the co-founder and CEO of **[Standard Bots](https://standardbots.com/)**.

Evan is the perfect person to kick this off.

I have known Evan for ~20 years, which is crazy. We went to Duke together, worked at the one legitimate startup on campus together (which [still exists](https://www.shoeboxed.com/)!), and even won a Lehman Brothers Case Competition together (which won us the opportunity to interview at the investment bank right before it went under).

After school, Evan went right into tech. He was in an early YC cohort, back when those were small. He started a company with Ashton Kutcher. I was interested in tech from the outside and always loved talking to Evan, so we’d catch up at reunions and then go our separate ways. In September 2023, a mutual acquaintance emailed me saying “there’s a company you should have on your radar, *[Standard Bots](https://standardbots.com/)*,” and I looked it up, and lo and behold, it was founded by Evan Beard!

Since reconnecting, Evan has become one of a small handful of people I ask dumb robot questions to. He’s testified in front of Congress on robotics. Last year he spoke at Nvidia’s GTC on the main stage. He was even featured doing robotic data collection in A24’s movie *Babygirl* alongside Nicole Kidman! Evan knows robots.

And the questions are very dumb! Robotics as a category has scared me. As valuations have soared, I’ve mostly avoided writing about or investing in robots, because I haven’t felt confident enough that I know what I’m talking about to take a stand.

Which is the whole point of these co-written essays!

Evan has dedicated his career to a specific belief about how to build a robotics company. He’s making a different bet than the more hyped companies in the space[1](https://www.notboring.co/p/robot-steps#footnote-1-184546099), one that is like a Russian Doll with a supermodel in the middle - not very sexy on the outside but sexier and sexier the more layers you remove until you get to the center and you’re like, “damn.”

So throw on a little Robot Rock…

And let’s get to it.

# Many Small Steps for Robot, One Giant Leap for Mankind

*A Co-Written Essay With Evan Beard*

There is a belief in my industry that the value in robotics will be unlocked in **giant leaps**.

Meaning: robots are not useful today, but throw enough GPUs, models, data, and PhDs at the problem, and you’ll cross some threshold on the other side of which you will meet robots that can walk into any room and do whatever they’re told.

In terms of both dollars and IQ points, this is the predominant view. I call it the Giant Leap view.

The Giant Leap view is sexy. It holds the promise of a totally unbounded market – labor today is a ~$25 trillion market, constrained by the cost and unreliability of humans; if robots become cheap, general, and autonomous, the argument goes that you get Jevons Paradox for labor- available to whichever team of geniuses in a garage produces the big breakthrough first. This is the type of innovation that Silicon Valley loves. Brilliant minds love opportunities where success is just a brilliant idea away.

The progress made by people who hold these beliefs has been exciting to watch. Online, you can find videos of robots [walking](https://www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/1orvsuw/chinese_companys_new_humanoid_robot_moves_so/), [backflipping](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1q8uk7o/atlas_ends_this_years_ces_with_a_backflip/), [dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw), [unpacking groceries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yQHYNXPws), [cooking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uexur9rOxW4), [folding laundry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyURDZB7imo), [doing dishes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AINewsMinute/comments/1kf4rze/california_startup_unveils_%CF%8005_ai_for/). This is Jetsons stuff. Robotic victory appears, at last, to be a short extension of the trend lines away. On the other side lies fortune, strength, and abundance.

As a result, companies building within this view, whether they’re making models or full robots, have raised the majority of the billions of dollars in venture funding that have gone towards robotics in the past few years. That does not include the cash that Tesla has invested from its own balance sheet into its humanoid, Optimus.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NbnA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d3f3bf9-aef9-4cb9-974b-296ad2c63bd5_909x702.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NbnA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d3f3bf9-aef9-4cb9-974b-296ad2c63bd5_909x702.png)

**To be clear, the progress they’ve made is real**. VLAs (vision-language-action models), diffusion policies, cross-embodiment learning, sim-to-real transfer. All of these advancements have meaningfully expanded what robots can do in controlled settings. In robotics labs around the world, robots are folding clothes, making coffee, doing the dishes, and so much more. Anyone pretending otherwise is either not paying attention or not serious.

It’s only once you start deploying robots outside of the lab that something else becomes obvious: **robotics progress is not gated by a single breakthrough.** There is no single fundamental innovation that will suddenly automate the world.

We will eventually automate the world. But my thesis is that progress will happen by climbing the gradient of **variability**.

Variability is the range of tasks, environments, and edge cases a robot must handle. Aerospace and self-driving use Operational Design Domain (ODD) to formally specify the conditions under which a system can operate. Expanding the ODD is how autonomy matures. It’s even more complex for robotics.

Robotic variables include **what you’re handling** (identical vs. thousands of different SKUs), **where you’re working** (climate-controlled warehouse with perfect lighting vs. a construction site with dust, uneven terrain, weather, and changing layouts), **how complex a task is** (single repetitive motion vs. multi-step assembly requiring tool changes), **who’s around** (operating in a caged-off cell vs. collaborating alongside workers in shared space), **how clear the instructions are** (executing pre-programmed routines vs. interpreting natural language commands like “clean this up” or “help me with this”), and **what happens when things go wrong** (stopping when something goes wrong vs. detecting errors, diagnosing causes, and autonomously recovering).

Multiply these variables together and the range can be immense[2](https://www.notboring.co/p/robot-steps#footnote-2-184546099). This is because the spectrum of real, human jobs is extremely complex. A quick litmus test is that a single human can’t just do every human job.

Most real jobs are not fully repetitive, but they’re also not fully open-ended. They have structure, constraints, and inevitable variation, much to the chagrin of Frederick Winslow Taylor, Henry Ford, and leagues of industrialists since. Different parts, slightly bent boxes, inconsistent lighting, worn fixtures, humans nearby doing unpredictable things.

It’s the same for robots.

At one end, you have **motion replay**. The robot moves from Point A to Point B the same way, every time. No intelligence required. This is how the vast majority of industrial robots work today. You save a position, then another, then another, and the robot traces that path forever. It’s like “record Macro” in Excel. It works beautifully as long as nothing ever changes.

At the other extreme, you have something like a **McDonald’s worker**. Different station every three minutes. Burger, then fries, then register, then cleaning. Totally different tasks, unpredictable sequences, human interaction, chaotic environment. The dream of general physical intelligence is a robot that can walk into this environment and just... work.

At one extreme is automation. At the other is autonomy. Between those extremes lies almost all economically valuable work.

Between automation and a McDonald’s robot that can fully replace a worker is an incredible number of jobs.

It’s my belief that these **small** steps across this spectrum are where we’ll unlock major economic value today.

That’s what my company [Standard Bots](https://standardbots.com/) is betting on.

Standard Bots makes AI-native, vertically integrated robots. We’re currently focused on customers within manufacturing and logistics. We’ve built a full stack solution for customers to train robot AI models, from data collection, review, and annotation, to model training and deployment. And we make these tools accessible enough for the average manufacturing worker to use.

In a market full of moonshots, our strategy might look conservative. Even tens of millions of dollars in revenue is nothing compared to the ultimate, multi-trillion dollar, abundance-inducing prize that lies in the future.

It isn’t.

**We are building a real business today because we believe that it’s the most likely to get us to that abundance-inducing end state first.**

### **Two Strategies: Giant Leap or Small Step**

If you believe there’s a massive set of economically valuable tasks waiting on the far side of some threshold, then the optimal strategy is to **straight-shot** it. Lock your team in the lab. Scale models. Scale compute. Don’t get distracted by deployments that might slow you down. **Leap**.

If you believe, like we do, that there is a continuous spectrum of economically valuable jobs, many of which robots can do today, then the best thing to do is to get your robots in the field early and get to work.

Each deployment teaches you where you are on the gradient. Success shows you what’s stable, failure shows you where the model breaks, and both tell you exactly what to work on fixing next. You **iterate**. You take **small steps**.

It’s widely accepted in leading LLM labs that data is king. The optimal data strategy is to climb this spectrum one use case at a time. You don’t need “more” data. What you really want is **diversity**[3](https://www.notboring.co/p/robot-steps#footnote-3-184546099), **on-policyness**[4](https://www.notboring.co/p/robot-steps#footnote-4-184546099), and **curriculum**[5](https://www.notboring.co/p/robot-steps#footnote-5-184546099). Climbing the spectrum iteratively is the strategy that best optimizes for these three dimensions of good data for any given capital budget. Real deployments on your bots get you on-policyness (nothing else can), the market intelligently curates a curriculum, and both provide rich and economically relevant diversity.

We’ve learned this lesson over years of deployments.

**Whenever robotics evolves to incorporate another aspect of the job spectrum between automation and autonomy, it also unlocks another set of jobs, another set of customers, another chunk of the market. One small step at a time.**

Take screwdriving. It is *much* easier to use end-to-end AI to find a screw or bolt than to try to put everything just so in a preplanned and fixed position. Search and feedback is cheap for learning systems. Our robot can move the screwdriver around until it feels that it’s in the right place. It wiggles the screwdriver a little. It feels when it drops into the slot. If it slips, it adjusts. And when our robots figure out how to drive a screw, it unlocks a host of jobs that involve screwdriving. Then we start doing those and learn the specifics of each of them, too.

We learn on the job and get better with time. Many of these robots are imperfect, but they’re still useful. **There’s no magic threshold you have to cross before robots become useful.**

That’s not our hypothesis. It’s what the market is telling us.

Industrial robotics is already a large, proven market. [FANUC](https://www.fanucamerica.com/), the world’s leading manufacturer of robotic arms, does on the order of $6 billion in annual revenue. [ABB’s](https://new.abb.com/news/detail/125276/q1-2025-results?utm_source=chatgpt.com) robot
