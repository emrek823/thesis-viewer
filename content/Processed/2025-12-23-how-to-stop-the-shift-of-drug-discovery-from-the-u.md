By Scott Gottlieb

May 6, 2025

Gottlieb, served as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration from 2017 to 2019.

Five years ago, U.S. pharmaceutical companies didn’t license any new drugs from China. By 2024, [one-third](https://www.wsj.com/articles/obesity-drugmaker-verdiva-bio-grabs-411-million-venture-financing-10f015eb) of their new compounds were coming from Chinese biotechnology firms.

Why are U.S. drugmakers sending their business to China? As in many other industries, it’s so much cheaper to synthesize new compounds inside Chinese biotechnology firms once a novel biological target has been discovered in American laboratories.

Yet the costs of developing new drugs in the U.S. needn’t be so high. They are driven up, in part, by increasing regulatory requirements that burden early-stage drug discovery in America. That’s especially true for Phase I clinical trials, in which drugs are tested in people for the first time.
