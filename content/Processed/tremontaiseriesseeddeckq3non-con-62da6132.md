## Slide 3: Executive Summary

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The status quo in drug safety assessment is **broken**. AI can help.

Preclinical toxicology is one of drug development's biggest bottlenecks: slowed by manual workflows, subjective reads, and labor-intensive reporting. Tremont AI accelerates these processes for faster, more consistent, and more reliable safety assessment.

## Slide 4: Safety & Efficacy Assessment

**Image description:** A two-part diagram showing the process of safety & toxicology assessment and preliminary efficacy assessment, followed by three bar charts illustrating toxicity and efficacy outcomes.

**Part 1: Safety & Toxicology Process**
1.  Healthy animals
2.  Treated with a drug candidate (indicated by a capsule icon)
3.  Tissue necropsy
4.  Assessment of histologic signs of toxicity

**Part 2: Efficacy (preliminary) Process**
1.  Animals with disease
2.  Treated with a drug candidate (indicated by a capsule icon)
3.  Biopsies from organ of interest
4.  Assessment of drug efficacy

## Slide 5: Problem - Preclinical Toxicology: A Time and Cost Bottleneck

### PROBLEM
Preclinical Toxicology: A Time and Cost Bottleneck

**Resource-Intensive Process**
*   ~10,000 slides in a 12-month chronic rodent study
*   >50 organs per animal, across multiple dose groups
*   Only a few hundred board-certified toxicologic pathologists worldwide

**Scale of the Challenge**
*   ~500–700 GLP studies annually at a large pharma
*   Pathology costs alone per chronic rodent study around $100K–$250K
*   Review adds ~3–6 months after in-life for chronic studies

**Imperfect methods**
*   Needles in haystacks
*   Subjectivity in distinguishing spontaneous from drug-induced lesion
*   Semi-quantitative labelling at best

## Slide 6: Problem - The Result: A Broken, Expensive System

### PROBLEM
The Result: A Broken, Expensive System

**False Negatives**
Promising drug candidates rejected unfairly, wasting research investment and delaying treatments

**Financial Impact**
Increased development costs, wasted resources, and missed market opportunities

**False Positives**
Unsafe compounds advance to clinical trials, creating patient risk and catastrophic late-stage failures

**Development Delays**
Extended timelines reduce patent exclusivity period and delay clinical trials

## Slide 21: Competitive Landscape

### Competitive Landscape
No one is focusing on unlocking all the rich historical toxicopathology and histology!

**Deciphex (DIRECT)**
*   PathoZoom Platform
*   EU CRO focus
*   €6M raised
*   **Gap:** Rule-based, no AI. EU-only.

**Histofy (DIRECT)**
*   Tox Path AI
*   Small biotechs
*   $1M seed
*   **Gap:** Limited data, basic models.

**AIRA Matrix (DIRECT)**
*   Preclinical AI
*   Single organs
*   $8M raised
*   **Gap:** Point solutions, academic only.

**PathAI (ADJACENT)**
*   Human Pathology
*   Clinical focus
*   $255M raised
*   **Gap:** Human-only, wrong market.

**Axiom (ADJACENT)**
*   In Silico Prediction
*   Computational tox
*   Series A
*   **Gap:** No tissue validation.

**Indica (HALO) (PLATFORM)**
*   Image Analysis
*   Quant pathology
*   $20M+ ARR
*   **Gap:** Manual features, no AI.

**Visiopharm (PLATFORM)**
*   Traditional Quant
*   Pharma labs
*   Acquired $300M
*   **Gap:** Pre-AI technology.

**Instem (Provantis) (PLATFORM)**
*   Study Management
*   Workflow & SEND
*   Public
*   **Gap:** No image analysis.

**Tremont AI**
**Foundation Model for Toxicology Pathology**
**Our Edge:**
*   Millions of real tox path images from 20+ years
*   Species-specific models: rat (current), expanding to mouse, dog, monkey, rabbit
*   Zero-shot rare lesion detection
*   Every study improves the model
*   Built for GLP regulatory submissions

**Proscia (ADJACENT)**
*   Digital Path Platform
*   Generic viewer
*   $37M raised
*   **Gap:** No tox expertise.

**Owkin (ADJACENT)**
*   Drug Discovery AI
*   Target discovery
*   $184M raised
*   **Gap:** Discovery, not safety.

## Slide 22: TRACE (FT) Agreement with Consensus

**a. Diagram: Validation of TRACE (FT) model**
1.  100 slides from 22 studies are input.
2.  Parallel processes:
    *   **TRACE (FT)** leads to Lesion-wise predictions (example images: Hypertrophy, Bile duct proliferation).
    *   **Pathologist annotations (n=10)** lead to Independent diagnosis.
3.  Independent diagnosis feeds into Analyse majority.
4.  Analyse majority leads to **Consensus (n=3)**.

**b. Chart: Quadratic Cohen's score for various lesions**

**Chart Title:** Quadratic Cohen's score (X-axis: 0.0 to 1.0)
**Legend:**
*   TRACE (FT) agreement with consensus (black diamond)
*   Average pathologist agreement with consensus (dashed line with empty circle/square)
