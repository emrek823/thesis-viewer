**Client**
Hello, I'm very broadly just trying to understand the payment integrity landscape. I saw that you're at Cotiviti office. They've come up as the leader in payment integrity and healthcare. I have some specific questions, but overall, just really trying to understand the business model and how it works. Maybe a good place to start is if you wouldn't mind, I know you're a VP of product management, but would love to just understand a little bit about your background and then specifically what that means at Cotiviti.

**Expert**
Yeah. My background is I've been working for the past 20 years on all kinds of projects related to pre-adjudication and some of the post-adjudication edits for payors, not only in claims. My experience is broader than just the claims. It's also including enrollment, which helps in the post-pay COB business for payment integrity and other things like eligibility payments and so forth.

I've been doing this for a while. Now, I'm working on multiple projects related to pretty much all of the aspects of the payment integrity. I don't know how deep you know that, but there are typically multiple steps. Pre-adjudication, post-adjudication, prepay, and then the post-pay audit. We are doing all of those and I have pretty good knowledge about these domains.

**Client**
Awesome. Time on some of my bigger questions. When I think about payment integrity, I know historically a lot of the industry was based on reactive or retrospective audits, but a lot of the industry now, as you mentioned, it's prepay and moving to more proactive spaces. I'm just curious to understand because from what I can find online, it seems like the business model is really based on contingency. You guys get paid depending on how many errors you find. Does that change in the prepay model at all? Is there movement towards software pricing?

**Expert**
No, it's about the same. The difference from the business model between the prepay and post-pay, it's the revenue model because post-pay is a bit heavier on the human resources because people need to review the payments and do some clinical analysis or some other financial analysis while prepay, it's not exactly real time. There is some lag, but it is relatively fast and for the most part, automated.

Only if there are claim denials, sometimes they need to go for the review but most of this is the automated rules. The revenue percentage based on the recovery that becomes the contingency payment for the payment integrity vendor is different. For the prepay, it's roughly 10%. Again, it varies of course, based on the contract, negotiations. For the post-pay, it's about 20% from the savings that have been recovered for the health plan.

**Client**
Got it. Okay. From what I can see online, it's 15%-20%. Is that right or over time, is that going down?

**Expert**
Yeah. It's about that. Again, sometimes in the payment integrity, the vendor may be not the only vendor. For example, many plans do two or even three passes for the prepayment. Meaning if a vendor sits third in the row, then the amount of the recovery will be very low because two vendors before them will spot most obvious things so the actual flow or savings will be very low. In that case, the contract may include the higher contingency payment to justify the whole effort. It really depends on the case-by-case basis.

**Client**
Got it. Sorry, let me make sure I understand that. You're saying sometimes, a lot of plans will do two to three passes through things with different payment integrity vendors. If you're the third vendor, then obviously, you're not making a ton of money so maybe your contingency is going to be higher, your percentage of contingency.

**Expert**
Yeah. Again, it really depends on the contract. If they give you so little business and the amount of revenue you make from this is negligible, that probably doesn't make sense to do the whole thing. We try to negotiate these deals to make sense for both the payment integrity vendor and the health plan.

**Client**
That makes sense. I'd love to get your take on the business model more generally. A good place to start is just don't understand how services heavy this is. I know there's a pretty large software component, but I'd love to understand how much human involvement there is.

**Expert**
The services are more heavy on the postpaid audit side. On the prepayment, vendors like Cotiviti and Optum use coders to do some additional validation and review. When the claim gets potentially denied or paused for additional review, this is where the services piece will come in. Also, there is a lot of services at the time of the integration.

It's more or less one-time thing, but it's sometimes very heavy because to do the payment integrity efficiently, the health plan needs to provide a lot of data to vendors. Data about the members, about the benefits, providers, and so forth, of course, claims themselves, history of claims. There is about 400 data elements that we need to really do things efficiently. That is another services aspect. It's more of a software installation configuration and making sure the data flows correctly.

**Client**
On the post-pay audit side, just before I move on from that, [quick count,] that's heavy just because there are nuances that need human involvement or what?

**Expert**
Exactly. For the post-pay, the payment has happened already, so now you need to be a bit more certain because the payment recovery process is relatively expensive and therefore, additional human review is necessary for things like COB conflicts.

Again, there are some rules which are just automated but in many cases, for the post-pay, the claim has already passed through the prepay sections so there is much less to find and that much less often requires machine learning or models. They for example have 80% accuracy. 80% accuracy when you talk about recovering the payment, it means human needs to review and confirm, "Yeah. This is accurate." That's why it's a bit more labor intensive.

**Client**
Got it. Can you speak a little bit more about the integration point? I'm trying to understand when you're first integrating with a payor or a health plan, how challenging is that? How much time does it take? What does that process look like?

**Expert**
It is very challenging. The main reason is the sheer amount of data that needs to be sent and the distribution of data across the health plan is typically very complex because membership systems or benefits management systems are typically owned by one department. The claims is another department.

All kinds of COB information is somebody else. Provider networks, provider contracts, all these are scattered across the whole IT infrastructure of a health plan. Collecting all that data is a pretty heavy project by itself. This is one of the integration points. It is collecting the initial data.

Typically, the integration is done with the core administrative system or adjudication system. It can be HealthEdge, QNext, whatever else they use, where they would be sending us. Now, the claims that are coming in and all the associated data if there are claim attachments or any supplementary information, they would send it to us for processing. That's another point of communication.

We send back a specialized file with the recommendation about what to do with this claim. Either it needs to be repriced or it may be denied altogether. That is the action that then may or may not be taken by the adjudication system itself.

**Client**
Got it. Okay. I'm just trying to understand the implementation piece still. How portable is the product? Is it very even? If you're selling it to new payors, how portable is it or is it always going to involve this crazy implementation window?

**Expert**
No. It's not crazy. Again, you do it five times, the sixth time it becomes much easier because you understand all the formats. I can't say it's easily portable. It's not plug and play, definitely. You really have to work with individual health plans on their unique circumstances but for the most part, we can leverage standard mechanisms.

Again, plan to plan depends but for example, the provider data can be in standard EDI transaction 274 claims. Again, typically, they come in 837 so we can consume those natively. It's just a matter of getting access to that information. Enrollment data again 834 but depending on the benefits management system, they may have different layouts. They can have CSU file. Every time you see the new payor, it's not like you're building things from scratch and you just see it for the first time.

Obviously, we all have existing patterns so implementation team replicates these from plan to plan. The amount of work is still relatively high because we need to agree on can they do 837s, or their adjudication system uses some flat file format or some XML. All those nuances is what typically derails the steady implementation flow but it's relatively replicable.

**Client**
Got it. How long for maybe a regional plan?

**Expert**
Small regional plan would probably take about three, four months to go live. Again, you need to understand that it depends on the level of maturity of the team because if it's a new start-up and they just begin doing things, definitely it'll take longer. If this is a bigger organization like Cotiviti, it would be about that because we have resources and skills.

**Client**
Got it. The other big piece that I'm curious about is how payment integrity and some of the vendors in the space are starting to take more of a role in value-based care. I'd just love to understand. Maybe if you can spell it out for me how that's worked.

**Expert**
Yeah. We do value-based care as well through the Edifecs acquisition. Value-based care is a slightly different domain because it is a shared risk or there are different models in the value-based care and typically, you don't need to really do that much of the work on the payment integrity because in many cases, it can be a capitated model, meaning you can send as many claims as you like but you get paid only that amount. In which case, you don't do any payment integrity because there is nothing to really adjust. I would say it's a slightly different domain, but it's not that mainstream and it's been out there for a while.

**Client**
What about instances with shared savings where you would need those claims and the calculations?

**Expert**
Again, shared savings basically means that if you can reduce your utilization by 20%, we can pay you 10% back. Essentially, it's moving the payment integrity more on the provider's revenue cycle management so

they can optimize their things but it still exists because even in that model, providers may still request or code the claim to get paid more for certain things.

Payment integrity doesn't go away, but the amount of savings is decreasing because providers now incentivized to not do these things. That is how it typically works but if it's not a capitated payment, the payment integrity will still be in place and will still provide some savings.

**Client**
Got it. Okay. Something that I've been thinking more about is just with the rise of specialty value-based care, how there will start to be a lot of issues around payment integrity. With the fact that there's going to be multiple attribution, a PCP could be attributed to a patient at the same time as specialists and how that all works. Is that something that Cotiviti and some of these other vendors are focused on? What are your thoughts on that?

**Expert**
We're not per se focused on this because that's a very small amount of payors and providers who do this today. This is not the main focus, but we do have rules for certain type of scenarios. We have more than I think 300 rules if I remember correctly, for prepay itself. Some of those rules are targeting situations like that. We have rules for the Medicaid business, like you mentioned, when there is a member attribution to physicians.

Again, it depends on the provider contracts because typically what happens is if a member is attributed to a certain provider, then the contract with that provider, it's an in network type of thing. Meaning there are some obligations from provider to build things in certain way and payor would also make some concessions to make it affordable to provider.

If the same member goes to another provider for example, and if it's not Medicaid for instance, that provider may have a different contract and therefore, payment integrity system needs to account for that. All in all, we do process these, but it is just one of the rules that we have. We have many rules for the provider contracts like in network, out of network. There are overlapping networks for different services, things like that. Payment integrity vendors do this, but this is not a key focus.

**Client**
Got it. Okay. The other thing, just going back to the beginning of the conversation on pre and post-pay, I think I read online that most of the business is moving towards prepay audits, that area because historically, when you think about payment integrity vendors, most of them are focused on post-pay audits and then over time, they moved into prepay. If you think about the business today, when a health plan signs up with you guys, do they have both prepay and post-pay audits or do some payors just have post-pay audits that they work with you on?

**Expert**
I would say many major payors actually operate more within the prepay intervention than the post-pay audit. Machinify, it's one of the competitors, they recently acquired Rawlings to do the COB and postpay edits. Lyric, Zelis, they all iterate more in the prepayment section than in the post-pay and COB. In general, without giving out any numbers, the revenue for the prepay is bigger than for the post-pay. Definitely where the revenue is, the vendors will go there first, so strictly you're right.

**Client**
I was just curious on how does the prepay then work? Obviously, we've talked about this. This is based on contingency so it's errors that you find but how does the payor validate that you're not just making up errors? Obviously, postpayment it's easier because you can say, "Look. This money went to the wrong person. We're going to claw it back from them and we'll get a portion of that" but when it's prepayment, how do you show that it's accurate?

Yeah. It's a combination of the reputation, best experience references. That's why it's relatively difficult to get into this space from nothing, because there is a notion of trust, of course, but also payors do the audits. They periodically check the recommendations we make. Also, the final decision is not on us. We provide recommendations to the adjudication system.

Yes, in many cases, or maybe most of the cases, adjudication system will just take this as is submit back but there is a concern of the provider appeals because provider may always appeal the decision. This is the check and balances type of situation when, if payors would begin seeing a lot of appeals for the edits done by certain vendor, they may question the quality of the work.

Even in the post-pay, the quality and the trust is very critical because what you're doing is you're saying that you have overpaid to that member or to that provider and this is why. Again, given the volumes of recommendations coming in the post-pay, often cases, health plans just have to trust that the recommendation is correct. They go and try to recover that money. Same thing, if they face pushback with recovery and providers basically say, "No, I disagree. I dispute that decision," they can come back and reassess whether this vendor is trustworthy.

**Client**
That makes sense. Another question, I'm sorry. I'm popcorning them all over the place. We hit on this a bit about the fact that it's not super services heavy, it's outside of implementation, but I know the margins are very, very high and my question is why is that? Is it just that really once the software is in place, it's typical high-margin software where you don't really have to add that much human intervention to it and it can just run on its own? Can you explain that to me?

**Expert**
That depends on how deep and how many edits. You can do the pure automated edits and you can probably get to maybe 2% of savings with pure automation and that will lead to a pretty high operating margin because you just have the software that runs by itself. You don't need any services.

If you want to capture more and more revenue, then you would need to add the services piece for like claim pattern review, the quoting accuracy review, things like this. This is where you can increase your revenue but the profit margin will definitely decrease because of the added human labor. It really depends on the vendor. Being one of the major vendors, we're trying to capture as much as possible.

Whatever investors prefer to have either high revenue or high margin, you can tweak the business model based on that.

**Client**
That makes sense because you guys I think are pretty high margin. I think that was why I was interested because it does seem like there's a pretty heavy services component. I was just trying to understand.

**Expert**
Keep in mind that there are many things that happen outside of the claim payment process. For example, for things like COB or post payment audit and even prepayment, you have to do a lot of data mining to understand the payment patterns, the outlier detection. You need to build and collect a lot of information and that information needs to be validated, processed.

Again, there is a lot of services you need to connect to different provider EMR systems. Sometimes, you need to feed the clinical data to see what's happening. You need to have the history of benefits for this member. You need to know which other plans this member may be part of or his family.

There are some very tricky use cases where for example, when the baby is born and this is a regulation which I didn't know before I saw this, the primary plan is one of the two parents, assuming they have different plans, whose month of birth is first, not who is older or younger, it's just pretty much random allocation.

Knowing these type of rules, you have to have the data for what is the payment plan for father, what is the

payment plan for mother. Collection of the data is relatively human labor-intensive process. Keep that in mind. For a lot of things to be very highly accurate, you have to do a lot of homework outside of this payment process.

**Client**
Interesting. I think we covered everything. I just had high-level basic questions, so I think we covered everything. Is there anything else I should know as I'm thinking about payment integrity and the business model?

**Expert**
No, I think you got it about the business model. I think you had that question, the savings can really vary. For prepay, it will be probably from 1%-3%. For the post-pay, it's a bit smaller. Can be maybe up to 1.5% to in rare cases 3% but I honestly haven't seen that. Medicaid and commercial have typically a bit higher recovery rate because Medicare is so regulated and they put so much pressure on both providers and health plans. Those are the things to consider. I don't know either you are a PE firm or start-up, but those things need to be kept in mind.

**Client**
Okay. I only really needed a half an hour. I think they sent for an hour. I can give you the time back if that works.

**Expert**
Okay.

**Client**
Thank you so much. This was really helpful. Bye.
