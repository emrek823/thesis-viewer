### Convexia Background

- Co-founder Ayaan Parikh with Rahul (known since 8th grade), both Stanford CS
- Not technically raising until next week (YC batch), looking at starting at $3M at $30M
- Long-term goal: run full drug discovery pipeline internally
- Current model: selling technology components to clients
	- Client provides query → run through stack → deliver output
	- Improves internal orchestration and models
	- Plan to leverage learnings from 20+ company relationships for internal asset discovery

### Technology Platform & Capabilities

- Asset discovery queries handled:
	- NEV 1.8 small molecule searches
	- Preclinical studies that failed animal safety
	- Discontinued/shelved assets with 7+ years IP runway
- Competitive advantage over Cortellis, Patsnap, Evaluate Pharma:
	- Competitors pull only from structured databases (ClinicalTrials.gov, etc.)
	- Convexia uses AI agents on unstructured data (videos, conference audio, PDFs, posters)
	- Clients report finding double the valuable assets vs PatchDeck
- Three core diligence stacks:
	- Technical operations
	- Market insights (financial forecasting, geographic splits, probability of success)
	- Scientific evaluation
- Automated consulting-style PDF reports based on training from public/accessible consulting reports

### Future Focus Areas

- Target therapeutic areas when running internal pipeline:
	- Solid tumor oncology - prostate cancer, ADCs, radioligand therapies
	- Rare disease - pediatric genetic disorders, tropical diseases
	- Known targets with FDA designations
	- High-potential assets from underfunded labs (budget cuts creating opportunities)
- Data wish list for full-stack operations:
	- Customer feedback data to improve internal orchestration
	- Software integration with customer data rooms
	- Internal organizational data for enhanced market analysis
