# State of Health AI 2026

## Bessemer’s analysis explores how healthcare innovation is evolving beyond the hype, revealing the unique promise of Health Tech 2.0 through private market signals and the emerging power of the “Health AI X factor.”

![State of Health AI graphic](https://www.bvp.com/assets/themes/bvp-24/img/clear-post-banner.gif)

2025 marked a turning point for the healthcare innovation industry. We witnessed pivotal signs of technology adoption, driven by AI, sustainable business models, and reinvigorated returns and excitement in both the public and private markets. The IPO window reopened with force—six Health Tech companies went public between 2024 and 2025, adding $36.6 billion in fresh market capitalization after a two-year drought. These weren't the unprofitable, hype-driven businesses that stumbled in 2020 and 2021. This second generation—Waystar, Tempus, Hinge Health, Omada, Caris Life Sciences, and HeartFlow—brought strong unit economics, clear paths to profitability, and rapid growth that outpaced even the cloud software darlings of the last decade.

The public markets responded. [**Through our Bessemer Health Tech Index analysis**](#BVP-Health-Tech-Index), we saw that new health tech stocks rose 18% in 2025, matching the strong performance of the NASDAQ and S&P 500 indices and eclipsing the [Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index](https://cloudindex.bvp.com/) (EMCLOUD), which fell 7%. Yet despite these wins and metrics that rival or exceed those of high-growth software companies, health tech stocks still trade at a 10-20% discount to their cloud counterparts, despite the stronger underlying business metrics — new health tech stocks have 2x the revenue growth and FCF margin of high-growth software counterparts. Why? Public health tech companies are still earning back trust after the first generation's stumble.

**But here's what the skeptics are missing:** **This time is fundamentally different. AI is transforming healthcare technology from workflow tools into mission-critical infrastructure that drives both revenue growth, margin expansion, and, most excitingly, better clinical outcomes. The industry wonders: Are we in another bubble, or is this the real breakthrough moment for health tech?** 

Our analysis of public and private market data, combined with insights from hundreds of founder conversations, points decisively to the latter. 

Healthcare AI companies are hitting $100M ARR, even $200M ARR, in under five years versus 10+ years for healthcare software companies and ~7 for cloud companies. That's why we created the **Health AI X Factor** — a framework explaining how these businesses grow into their valuations through unprecedented velocity, margin expansion, and platform potential.

**In the State of Health AI 2026, we will cover:**

* Why Health Tech 2.0 is different (and why the trust gap will close)
* Three private market signals proving this isn't hype
* The Health AI X Factor framework and implications for venture investing
* Seven predictions for 2026 that will shape the next wave of innovation

## **Key predictions from the State of Health AI 2026**

1. Payers will feel pressure from providers to “catch up” on AI, driving a wave of adoption in the admin stack.
2. There will be a rise in clinical AI applications, primarily for triage and assessment with clinicians-in-the-loop.
3. CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) will launch experiments to attempt to establish clinical AI payment codes.
4. Cash-pay consumers will accelerate clinical AI adoption faster than any reimbursement code.
5. A nascent health AI data infrastructure category will blossom, gaining significant investment driven by demand from both model labs and application companies. But can they capture and sustain value in healthcare in the long term?
6. A new generation of AI-native value-based care companies will launch and scale.
7. New Age digital CROs will crack pharma’s R&D trilemma — cost, speed, and competitiveness.

## **Health tech insights based on public and private market performance in 2025**

The health tech public markets in 2025 were a comeback story. But to understand why, we need to look back at two distinct chapters in the sector's evolution.

### **A tale of two health tech generations**

**Health Tech 1.0 (2015-2021):** We can date the birth of technological innovation in healthcare around 2010, in response to two major U.S. policy overhauls: the 2008 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) and the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Health Tech 1.0 was the cohort of companies that grew in the decade that followed, with the COVID pandemic creating a perfect storm for the majority of this generation’s health tech IPOs. Telemedicine, virtual care, and digital health tools surged in adoption as COVID-19 prompted rapid digitization. Particularly between 2020 and early 2021, numerous health tech companies rushed to public markets, riding the wave of enthusiasm. Many, including Livongo (later acquired by Teladoc Health), Amwell, Hims & Hers Health, Doximity, and Definitive Healthcare, among others, went public with impressive top-line growth but weak unit economics, unproven retention, and business models that depended on pandemic-era tailwinds and a zero-interest-rate “growth-at-all-cost” mentality that would continue indefinitely.

When those tailwinds reversed, reality hit hard. These generation stocks' performance suffered, and the IPO window slammed shut in 2022 and stayed closed through 2023. These companies burned through public investor trust, and the entire sector paid the price.

**Health Tech 2.0 (2024-2025):** Fast-forward to 2024, and a new cohort began to emerge. The IPO window cracked open with [Waystar in June 2024](https://investors.waystar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/waystar-announces-pricing-initial-public-offering), followed by [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/news/pr/tempus-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering/?srsltid=AfmBOooLW0D33r2wCIG6EYURamMge_c0cnI5nMfeo0JLXHhBJ0q-MdBC). In 2025, four more companies joined them: [Hinge Health](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/hinge-health-ipo), [Omada Health,](https://www.omadahealth.com/) [Caris Life Sciences](https://www.carislifesciences.com/), and [HeartFlow](https://www.heartflow.com/). These six companies represented something fundamentally different from their predecessors. The Health Tech 2.0 cohort represents 30% of the $121B market cap of the 28 companies actively trading today that we track in our BVP Health Tech Index.

### **BVP Health Tech Index**

**Key insight:** [Health Tech 2.0 came to market with dramatically different profiles](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-health-tech-2024): profitable or near-profitable operations, strong net retention, proven ROI for customers, and business models that work regardless of macro conditions.

Take [Hinge Health](http://bvp.com/atlas/hinge-health-ipo), which went public in May 2025 at a $2.6B valuation (disclosure: Bessemer is an investor). As of Q3 2025, the company demonstrated 72% annualized revenue growth with 26% free cash flow margins—the kind of Rule of 40 at 98% (Annualized Revenue Growth plus LTM FCF Margin), a performance that investors see as a gold standard, even amongst SaaS giants. 

Or consider Tempus, which, despite posting a -22% FCF margin (investing heavily in growth), commanded a 9.3x EV/revenue multiple because of its 85% growth rate and AI-driven precision medicine platform that's genuinely transforming oncology care. Since its June 2024 IPO, Tempus stock has risen 65%, adding $5.7B in market cap.

In 2025, Health Tech 2.0 stocks rose 18%, in line with the NASDAQ's 23% gain and the S&P 500's 18% gain. Meanwhile, the “Health Tech 1.0“ index—companies that went public before the end of 2021—remained essentially flat. The broader health tech index, which includes both generations, finished up 4% for the year, handily beating the cloud software index's 7% decline.

**These early signals indicate a broader trend: Despite the strong performance of new IPOs in recent years, health tech remains undervalued relative to high-growth software.**

### **The trust gap: Why health tech still trades at a discount**

Despite strong performance, strong metrics, and clear strategic value, health tech stocks still trade at a discount to comparable high-growth software companies. This is what we call the "trust gap"—the lingering skepticism among public investors who remember the first generation's troubles.

**Let's look at the data:**

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Company** | **EV/Annual Revenue** | **Annualized Rev Growth** | **FCF Margin** | **Rule of** **(Rev Growth + FCF Margin)** |
| **Waystar** | 6.9x | 12% | 27% | 39 |
| **Tempus AI** | 9.3x | 85% | -22% | 63 |
| **Hinge Health** | 5.7x | 72% | 26% | 98 |
| **Omada Health** | 2.5x | 65% | -1% | 64 |
| **Caris LS** | 8.9x | 117% | -7% | 110 |
| **HeartFlow** | 13.8x | 49% | -36% | 13 |
| **HEALTH TECH 2.0 Avg** | **7.2x** | **67%** | **-2%** | **65** |
| **EMCLOUD Avg** | **8.0x** | **19%** | **19%** | **38** |

**What’s the takeaway?** Most of these Health Tech 2.0 companies are growing faster (67% y/y) than the EMCLOUD average (19% y/y), and several show stronger profitability profiles. Albeit at a smaller scale than its cloud counterparts. Yet they trade at lower multiples on average. 

**But why is there a “discount”?** Healthcare business models are still perceived as complex, regulatory risk is real, and memories of 2020-2021 valuations followed by steep declines are fresh. Public investors say that if these businesses show sustainable growth metrics over multiple quarters, sentiment may be re-rated. 

**The good news?** Healthcare companies are demonstrating sustainable high growth, quarter after quarter. As this track record builds, we expect the trust gap to narrow significantly over the next 12-24 months. The fundamentals are there, and the proof points are accumulating. Patient capital will be rewarded.

### **Why healthcare AI isn’t hype: Three signals from the private markets**

In the prior digitization era, healthcare lagged and struggled to achieve the growth and transition that its software counterparts in other industries enjoyed. Healthcare AI is compressing that evolution at a faster rate than any other industry. **Three private market trends prove this wave is different.** 

### **1. M&A activity surged in 2025, driven by a clear thesis that AI drives growth and margin expansion.**

**Global health tech M&A reached 400 deals in 2025, up from 350 in 2024.** But volume tells only part of the story. The strategic rationale matters more: Healthcare incumbents and private equity firms recognize that AI implementations simultaneously drive revenue growth and margin improvement.

Consider the rollup strategy: SmarterTechnologies acquired Access Healthcare (PE-backed), Thoughtful, and Bessemer’s portfolio company [SmarterDX](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/from-residency-to-rocketship-how-smarterdx-became-a-healthcare-ai-success-story) to infuse AI and automation throughout their RCM operations. The thesis? Leverage SmarterDx’s growth engine and clinical AI platform to drive productivity and margin expansion across the Access Healthcare RCM services conglomerate.

Other examples of acquisitions, including [Waystar’s acquisition of Iodine](https://investors.waystar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/waystar-acquire-iodine-software-accelerating-ai-powered) and [R1’s acquisition of Phare Health](https://www.r1rcm.com/news-and-press/r1-to-acquire-phare-health-a-leading-ai-platform-for-automating-inpatient-coding-and-pre-bill-clinical-documentation-improvement/), aren't speculative bets on future AI technology. Acquiring innovation or partnering with upstarts to grow the addressable market with point solutions into platforms is a [“layered cake strategy”](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/ten-lessons-from-a-decade-of-vertical-software-investing) by sophisticated operators who see revenue growth opportunities and/or an immediate margin improvement AI delivers and want to own those capabilities rathe
