"Until a health system knows the purchasing habits and overall spend for their non-acute facilities, it's hard for them to see the savings and efficiencies that are available." - Vizient, Inc.

“In most situations, buyers just look at the product price and shipping costs, glossing over price variances and quality changes that could result in being overcharged." - Revalize
