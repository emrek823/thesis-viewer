# RightSite Series A Fall 2023

## Slide 1: ER MD telehealth + SDOH navigation for EMS / 911 non-emergency patients

## Slide 2: Everyone Loses

### Text
130 million patients visit the ER each year.
50% of these visits are not emergencies.

### Chart: Everyone Loses Diagram
This chart illustrates a cycle where "Everyone Loses" due to non-emergency ER visits.
The central element is "Everyone Loses".
Surrounding elements represent the stakeholders affected:
*   **Patient** (depicted by a sad face)
*   **ER** (depicted by "ER" text with a building icon)
*   **EMS** (depicted by an ambulance icon)
*   **Payor** (depicted by a document with a dollar sign icon)

## Slide 3: Avoidable ER visits are expensive.

### Chart: ALL ER EPISODES
This chart breaks down ER episodes and their associated costs.

#### ALL ER EPISODES Distribution
*   **Avoidable ER Episodes:** 51%
*   **Needed ER Episodes:** 49%

#### Breakdown of Avoidable ER Episodes (71%)
*   **Avoidable discharge from ER:** 71%
*   **Avoidable in-patient admission:** 20%
*   **Avoidable observation stay:** 9%

#### Cost
*   **COST Weighted Avg Per Episode:** $4,300

Our solution changes 911 / EMS care.
Non-emergent 911/EMS patients receive EMS-activated ER MD telehealth and SDOH navigation.

### Diagram: RightSite Workflow
This diagram illustrates the RightSite workflow for non-emergent 911/EMS patients:
1.  **Ambulance Icon** (represents EMS/911 call)
2.  **Arrow pointing to House Icon** (represents diversion to home)
3.  **Crossed-out Hospital Icon** (represents avoiding the ER)
4.  **Arrow from House Icon pointing down to RIGHT SITE logo** (represents RightSite's intervention)

## Slide 5: RightSite Service and Outcomes

### Text
RightSite diverts ~70% of non-emergent 911/EMS patients.

### Diagram: RightSite Service Flow and Outcomes
This diagram illustrates the RightSite service flow and its outcomes.

#### Service Flow
1.  **911 / EMS**
2.  **RIGHT SITE** (with Board-Certified ER Doc and RightSite Navigator below it)
3.  **70% Diversion** (outcomes listed below)
    *   **Telehealth:** 31%
    *   **Urgent Care:** 37%
    *   **PCP:** 2%
    *   **ER:** 28%
    *   **Refusal:** 2%

#### Outcomes

*   **PATIENT SATISFACTION:** 9.7/10

### Results Source
Atlanta Results

### Bullet Points
*   EMS or Dispatch initiates RightSite's service "pre-ambulance"
*   ER MD telehealth
*   SDOH navigation
*   Follow-up services

## Slide 6: Call Volume and ER Diversion Rate

### Text
RightSite's 911/EMS call volume continues to grow. In October, we added our first 911/EMS client sending calls directly out of dispatch (San Antonio Fire/EMS) vs. on-site (Grady/ATL) eliminating the cost of an ambulance trip altogether.

### Chart: RightSite Activations 2023
This bar chart shows RightSite activation volume from January to October 2023, broken down by San Antonio and Atlanta.

| Month   | Total Activations | San Antonio | Atlanta |
| :------ | :---------------- | :---------- | :------ |
| Jan-23  | 19                |             | 19      |
| Feb-23  | 19                |             | 19      |
| Mar-23  | 20                |             | 20      |
| Apr-23  | 30                |             | 30      |
| May-23  | 115               |             | 115     |
| Jun-23  | 98                |             | 98      |
| Jul-23  | 80                |             | 80      |
| **Last 3 months** | | | |
| Aug-23  | 195               |             | 195     |
| Sep-23  | 303               | 50          | 253     |
| Oct-23  | 509               | 219         | 290     |

## Slide 7: Call Volume and ER Diversion Rate

### Text
This activation waterfall of results illustrates the contrast between Atlanta and San Antonio. Currently, Atlanta's volume comes entirely from the on-scene EMS, while San Antonio's volume originates entirely within the 911/EMS dispatch center. Both communities will eventually combine field and dispatch activations, but this "pure" view offers insight into the outcomes of these activation methods (field vs. dispatch).

### Chart: RightSite Activations (Overall)
This chart is a smaller version of the previous chart, showing the last 3 months.

## Slide 9: 911/EMS Footprint

### Text
RightSite's 911/EMS growth is a community-based land-and-expand strategy. Our first market was ATL, with recent launches in both SAT and JAX.
911/EMS is a tight-knit group, regionally and nationally. Most of our expansion has been regional referrals from our 911/EMS clients.

## Slide 10: RightSite is a Value-Based Provider

RightSite is a provider, not a vendor.

### Diagram: Revenue Models
This diagram shows two revenue models for RightSite:

*   **Fee For Service**
    *   Telehealth By ER MD
*   **Fee for Success**
    *   Case Rate Value-Based

## Slide 11: ATL Payor Type by Line of Business

### Text
This is RightSite's payor mix by primary line of business.
For the Uninsured population, RightSite formed the RightSite Foundation, a 501(c)(3), allowing local philanthropies to provide care to the uninsured at the individual patient level.
We estimate 1/4 of the Unknown and Uninsured category will ultimately be BCBS or retroactive and reinstated GA Medicaid.

### Chart: ATL by Line of Business April – September 2023
This pie chart shows the payor mix by line of business for RightSite in Atlanta from April to September 2023.

| Payor Type        | Percentage |
| :---------------- | :--------- |
| Unknown           | 22%        |
| Commercial        | 21%        |
| Medicare Advantage | 18%        |
| Managed Medicaid  | 17%        |
| Medicaid          | 10%        |
| Medicare          | 6%         |
| Uninsured         | 6%         |

## Slide 12: ATL Payor Type by Payor Mix

## Slide 13: ATL Market TAM Estimate

### Text
The TAM for RightSite's current Atlanta EMS client base is $76M, and does not include expansion counties in greater Atlanta.
Our financial model predicts ATL will handle 21,000 navigated calls/year in Year 3, equating to a 25% (21,000/83,349) market share of RightSite's current EMS customer base TAM, excluding ATL prospect counties/cities that potentially double the TAM (see note 8).

## Slide 17: RightSite Case Study

### Text
This RightSite case study demonstrates how our physician + navigator teams address clinical needs to deliver the right care while avoiding an unnecessary ER visits, and how the Navigator to solves SDOH gaps to drive better outcomes and experience at a lower cost – the Triple Aim.

### Case Highlight
Not every 911 run needs to go to the ER.

**47 yo female, called 911 for insomnia.**

Patient states she has not been able to sleep and is feeling "foggy." She takes Effexor, but has been out for several days because she lost her job and her insurance, and has not been able to follow up with her PCP. She has been using someone else's Xanax to help her sleep.

She called 911 because the insomnia was giving her anxiety. The 911 dispatcher felt that the patient could be helped outside the ER and offered her a RightSite telehealth evaluation, which she accepted.

**RightSite Outcome:** The patient received a refill of her medication and recommendations for other ways to manage her symptoms, as well as a discount code to lower her out-of-pocket prescription costs.

**Patient Quote:** “Whoever put this program together, I love them for it..... I am so thankful!”

**Patient Satisfaction Score:** 10/10
