## Slide 3: 14 Million Americans Live With a SMI and are a Massive Driver of Healthcare Cost

### Existing treatment options are:
*   **Expensive**
    *   >$300B spent on SMI in the US yearly
    *   6.3x higher spend on average vs non-SMI population, >50% have comorbidity
*   **Ineffective**
    *   SMI is the 2nd leading cause of 30-day hospital readmissions for Medicaid
*   **Fragmented**
    *   1 in 5 SMI patients has a substance use disorder - only 7% receive treatment for both

### Those seeking help remain stuck in the cycle
**Current SMI Patient Experience** (depicted as a cycle)
1.  Patient goes to ER for a health issue due to SMI
2.  Multi-day ER Stay
3.  Inadequate SMI treatment
4.  Hospital discharge without care plan
(Cycle repeats)

## Slide 4: Amae Does Not Separate Physical and Mental Health
Patients with SMI have significantly higher prevalence of costly chronic diseases

### Increase in Diabetes
*   2x higher prevalence of diabetes in SMI patients (9% across U.S. population)

### Reduced Life Expectancy
*   3x higher avg mortality for SMI patients, up to 20 year reduced life expectancy

### Increase in Hypertension
*   33% more prevalent in bipolar patients
*   50% of MDD patients have hypertension

### Cardiovascular Issues
*   Up to 3x higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in SMI patients

We relieve the burden from Disease-Management Programs (DMP)

| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jane goes to ER with chest pain & suicidal behaviors | • Re-hospitalization 2x/month for two months 3-5 days at a time | No adequate outpatient care results in multiple expensive hospitalizations without any long term stabilization |
|                                        | • Periods of stabilization for a few weeks             |                                                                                                |
|                                        | • Lack of care leads to frequent ER visits over months again |                                                                                                |

*   Obtain clarity on TGH priorities and how Amae Health can best support

## Slide 10: Appendix

## Slide 11: First, we take a high-touch approach to initial engagement
We intervene at a critical behavior change point and build trust through dedicated support for a patient's immediate needs

### Engage patient at the ED / Inpatient Psych
Pre-discharge, an onsite Amae Engager (LCSW & Peer Mentor) meets with the patient at the ED or Inpatient Psych Facility and onboards them into our community

### Supporting Services:
*   **Onboard and set up a care plan**
    *   We create an account for the patient, set up their care dashboard, receive consents and intake medical records to pair with claims data
*   **Care coordinator & health coach matching**
    *   Patient is matched with based on cultural competency, preferences, presenting symptoms, and medical history
*   **Housing facilitation and security**
    *   If needed, a living arrangement is provided based on their existing status and living conditions
*   **Telepsychiatry evaluation**
    *   When a psychiatrist is not available during a patient's hospitalization, we provide a telepsychiatry evaluation to expedite discharge

## Slide 12: Next, we provide delivery of holistic care
With a psychiatry-led model, we establish personalized treatment plans for patients' behavioral health, physical health and social health needs to vastly improve outcomes compared to existing solutions

(Diagram showing interconnected roles)

*   **Psychiatrist** (central role, connected to Health Coach and Care Coordinator)
    *   **Clinical (reporting to Health Coach)**
        *   NP / GP
        *   Medication Management
        *   Psychologist
    *   **Social Determinants of Health (reporting to Care Coordinator)**
        *   Support System
        *   Housing
        *   Community + Holistic Health

**Role Descriptions:**
*   Psychiatrist and the nurse practitioner / general physician work together to evaluate and establish a personalized medication and treatment plan including SUD treatment, comorbidity treatments, and medication side effect monitoring
*   Health coach and case coordinator (LCSW) acts as our patients' health "quarterbacks" and help address critical social determinants of health including but not limited to: housing, food security, sleep, exercise, mindfulness, support system engagement, community integration

## Slide 13: Over the long term, our patients advance from acute illness to prosperity planning

### Amae Prosperity Pact
*   Amae Peer Mentor + Prosperity Pact

**Details:**
*   Amae Patient is assigned an Amae Peer Mentor – an individual with SMI experience whom the patient can relate to and build trust with based on their condition
*   Peer mentor supports patient in completing their Amae Prosperity Pact – a set of measurable aims to re-establish meaning and purpose in a patient's life
*   Amae Patient will also be responsible for engaging in local community service efforts and volunteering in order to feel that they are contributing to their community and helping others

## Slide 14: A technology enabled hybrid model that meets patients where they are
Hybrid Care: Flexibility in engaging the patient how and when it makes the most sense

### Amae Care Center
*   An inclusive combined community center and outpatient clinical facility built / leased by Amae that provides education, mentorship, and social support in tandem with a healthcare center for clinical work
*   Option for temporary housing and respite care onsite as an emergency stopgap to build trust and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations

### Amae Digital Patient Platform
*   A single platform and EHR that:
    *   Integrates remote monitoring including assessments and adherence tracking
    *   Syncs data from digital health devices
    *   Presents meaningful data summary to clinicians and providers
    *   Enables personalized treatment planning and task management
    *   Video + asynchronous treatment

## Slide 15: We improve outcomes by first treating the SMI

### Flipping the treatment model to treat SMI as the primary condition
*   A psychiatrist serves as the lead clinician for our patients

### Taking on treatment costs for patients with the highest needs
*   Health outcomes are primarily driven by patients' undertreated SMI - physical health comorbidities cannot be managed until the SMI is treated

### Delivering innovative care to have transformational outcomes
*   We use more invasive yet effective and higher ROI treatments
    *   Long-acting injectables, Clozapine, IV Ketamine, TMS
*   We address SMI-specific SDOH:
    *   Substance abuse treatment, housing, employment, food security
