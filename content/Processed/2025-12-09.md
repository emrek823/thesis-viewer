**Updated:** 2025-12-09T19:54:39.320Z

### Current Traction & Revenue Performance

- Current ARR at ~$1.4-1.5M across four active contracts
	- Vituity: $420K (monthly, cleanest contract structure)
	- Astrana: ~$500K (mix of HEDIS reviews and claims, some revenue expected to decline)
	- Belong Health: $300K ($25K/month, currently unprofitable but fixing contract)
	- Clover: $250K (annual contract, converting to monthly)
- Strong unit economics emerging: 80% gross margins, 50% OPEX margins on new contracts
- Pipeline shows ~$4M potential without new sales exec’s network

### Series A Fundraising Strategy

- Pressure from Floodgate (Anya) and NEA (Blake) to raise Series A
- Blake confirmed company has late-stage Series A metrics already
- Gerald targeting 2-2.5M ARR with monthly payments before raising
- Considering strategic investors (Intermountain, Heritage) over traditional VCs initially
- Planning to attend JPM conference to start investor conversations
- Doesn’t need capital (20 months runway) but recognizes hiring/recruiting advantages of Series A

### Product & Operations Evolution

- Launched AI platform consolidating all workflows into single product
- Reducing sales cycles from 6-9 months to target <120 days
	- Recent pipeline deals converting in <30 days
- Shifting from cost-plus to value-based pricing model
	- New medication adherence wedge: $200K per measure with Clover (3 measures)
	- Requires legal work to restructure existing agreements
- Managing offshore team restrictions for larger national payers

### Next Steps & Pipeline Development

- Belong Health contract renegotiation at 4pm today (proposal may reduce from $500K)
- Clover Care discussion Friday on 3-measure medication adherence deal
- Exploring Centene opportunity in Nashville/Mississippi region
- New sales executive starting to expand network beyond existing pipeline
- Gerald to share deck with Virtue team for feedback

### Revenue Status & 2026 Goals

- Seeking to close two deals at $300K+ each by year-end (would reach $2M+ ARR)
	- Hospice deal and CHAP (accreditation body) both at board approval stage
	- CHAP deal particularly valuable as partnership opportunity - recognized by all home health/hospice enterprises
- 2026 target: $10M ARR through expansion strategy
	- Clinical Data Analyst product entering development phase
	- Initial expansion revenue $50-100K off existing $200-300K contracts

### Commercial Strategy & New Hire

- Hired salesperson with $4-5M annual quota for home health/hospice market
	- Former operator of Homecare 100 conference (top 100 hospices/home health companies)
	- Extensive relationship network, planning to “burn the book” of contacts
	- Positioned as “hired gun” rather than strategic commercial leader
- Enterprise focus for post-acute market going forward
- Health systems: targeting one referenceable customer by Q1-Q2 2026

### Product & Engineering Moat Development

- Primary 2026 focus: building defensible product foundation
	- Current deployment timeline 6-12 weeks, need to reduce significantly
	- Moving from human-in-the-loop to automated solutions
	- Head of engineering role needed but not yet prioritized
- Clinical Data Analyst wedge strategy
	- Targeting CNO/CMO departments for patient safety and quality use cases
	- 80-90% of queries can convert to expansion products
	- Three active health system conversations: Beth Israel, Marin Health, Jackson Memorial

### Team Building Discussion

- Current approach: hiring specialists for specific functions vs building executive team
- Virtue perspective: top-performing companies prioritize A+ talent density early
	- Reference examples: SmartIX, Translucent success stories
	- Concern about “hired gun” approach vs strategic leadership
- Acknowledged need to collect data points on optimal hiring approach
- Recognition that new hire already attracting enterprise interest

### Next Steps

- Send proper revenue update with specific numbers
- Include team building strategy in upcoming investor memo
- Develop “dream team” organizational chart working backwards from goals
- Continue onboarding new salesperson (48-hour Austin visit)

**Updated:** 2025-12-09T17:31:00.520Z

### Company Background and Strategy

- Rob Davenport, Founder at Squid IQ - platform for medical device utilization management
- Origin story: Discovered problem while working with NY Hospital Association on supply chain localization (2018)
	- Chief supply chain officer: “We know what devices we purchased, have no idea what we own”
	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision

**Updated:** 2025-12-09T17:31:00.520Z

### Company Background and Strategy

- Rob Davenport, Founder at Squid IQ - platform for medical device utilization management
- Origin story: Discovered problem while working with NY Hospital Association on supply chain localization (2018)
	- Chief supply chain officer: “We know what devices we purchased, have no idea what we own”
	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision

**Updated:** 2025-12-09T17:31:00.520Z

### Company Background and Strategy

- Rob Davenport, Founder at Squid IQ - platform for medical device utilization management
- Origin story: Discovered problem while working with NY Hospital Association on supply chain localization (2018)
	- Chief supply chain officer: “We know what devices we purchased, have no idea what we own”
	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision

### Current Traction & Revenue Performance

- Current ARR at ~$1.4-1.5M across four active contracts
	- Vituity: $420K (monthly, cleanest contract structure)
	- Astrana: ~$500K (mix of HEDIS reviews and claims, some revenue expected to decline)
	- Belong Health: $300K ($25K/month, currently unprofitable but fixing contract)
	- Clover: $250K (annual contract, converting to monthly)
- Strong unit economics emerging: 80% gross margins, 50% OPEX margins on new contracts
- Pipeline shows ~$4M potential without new sales exec’s network

### Series A Fundraising Strategy

- Pressure from Floodgate (Anya) and NEA (Blake) to raise Series A
- Blake confirmed company has late-stage Series A metrics already
- Gerald targeting 2-2.5M ARR with monthly payments before raising
- Considering strategic investors (Intermountain, Heritage) over traditional VCs initially
- Planning to attend JPM conference to start investor conversations
- Doesn’t need capital (20 months runway) but recognizes hiring/recruiting advantages of Series A

### Product & Operations Evolution

- Launched AI platform consolidating all workflows into single product
- Reducing sales cycles from 6-9 months to target <120 days
	- Recent pipeline deals converting in <30 days
- Shifting from cost-plus to value-based pricing model
	- New medication adherence wedge: $200K per measure with Clover (3 measures)
	- Requires legal work to restructure existing agreements
- Managing offshore team restrictions for larger national payers

### Next Steps & Pipeline Development

- Belong Health contract renegotiation at 4pm today (proposal may reduce from $500K)
- Clover Care discussion Friday on 3-measure medication adherence deal
- Exploring Centene opportunity in Nashville/Mississippi region
- New sales executive starting to expand network beyond existing pipeline

	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision

### Current Traction & Revenue Performance

- Current ARR at ~$1.4-1.5M across four active contracts
	- Vituity: $420K (monthly, cleanest contract structure)
	- Astrana: ~$500K (mix of HEDIS reviews and claims, some revenue expected to decline)
	- Belong Health: $300K ($25K/month, currently unprofitable but fixing contract)
	- Clover: $250K (annual contract, converting to monthly)
- Strong unit economics emerging: 80% gross margins, 50% OPEX margins on new contracts
- Pipeline shows ~$4M potential without new sales exec’s network

### Series A Fundraising Strategy

- Pressure from Floodgate (Anya) and NEA (Blake) to raise Series A
- Blake confirmed company has late-stage Series A metrics already
- Gerald targeting 2-2.5M ARR with monthly payments before raising
- Considering strategic investors (Intermountain, Heritage) over traditional VCs initially
- Planning to attend JPM conference to start investor conversations
- Doesn’t need capital (20 months runway) but recognizes hiring/recruiting advantages of Series A

### Product & Operations Evolution

- Launched AI platform consolidating all workflows into single product
- Reducing sales cycles from 6-9 months to target <120 days
	- Recent pipeline deals converting in <30 days
- Shifting from cost-plus to value-based pricing model
	- New medication adherence wedge: $200K per measure with Clover (3 measures)
	- Requires legal work to restructure existing agreements
- Managing offshore team restrictions for larger national payers

### Next Steps & Pipeline Development

- Belong Health contract renegotiation at 4pm today (proposal may reduce from $500K)
- Clover Care discussion Friday on 3-measure medication adherence deal
- Exploring Centene opportunity in Nashville/Mississippi region
- New sales executive starting to expand network beyond existing pipeline
- Gerald to share deck with Virtue team for feedback

### Revenue Status & 2026 Goals

- Seeking to close two deals at $300K+ each by year-end (would reach $2M+ ARR)
	- Hospice deal and CHAP (accreditation body) both at board approval stage
	- CHAP deal particularly valuable as partnership opportunity - recognized by all home health/hospice enterprises
- 2026 target: $10M ARR through expansion strategy
	- Clinical Data Analyst product entering development phase
	- Initial expansion revenue $50-100K off existing $200-300K contracts

	- Current deployment timeline 6-12 weeks, need to reduce significantly
	- Moving from human-in-the-loop to automated solutions
	- Head of engineering role needed but not yet prioritized
- Clinical Data Analyst wedge strategy
	- Targeting CNO/CMO departments for patient safety and quality use cases
	- 80-90% of queries can convert to expansion products
	- Three active health system conversations: Beth Israel, Marin Health, Jackson Memorial

### Team Building Discussion

- Current approach: hiring specialists for specific functions vs building executive team
- Virtue perspective: top-performing companies prioritize A+ talent density early
	- Reference examples: SmartIX, Translucent success stories
	- Concern about “hired gun” approach vs strategic leadership
- Acknowledged need to collect data points on optimal hiring approach

### Current Traction & Revenue Performance

- Current ARR at ~$1.4-1.5M across four active contracts
	- Vituity: $420K (monthly, cleanest contract structure)
	- Astrana: ~$500K (mix of HEDIS reviews and claims, some revenue expected to decline)
	- Belong Health: $300K ($25K/month, currently unprofitable but fixing contract)
	- Clover: $250K (annual contract, converting to monthly)
- Strong unit economics emerging: 80% gross margins, 50% OPEX margins on new contracts
- Pipeline shows ~$4M potential without new sales exec’s network

### Series A Fundraising Strategy

- Pressure from Floodgate (Anya) and NEA (Blake) to raise Series A
- Blake confirmed company has late-stage Series A metrics already
- Gerald targeting 2-2.5M ARR with monthly payments before raising
- Considering strategic investors (Intermountain, Heritage) over traditional VCs initially
- Planning to attend JPM conference to start investor conversations
- Doesn’t need capital (20 months runway) but recognizes hiring/recruiting advantages of Series A

### Product & Operations Evolution

- Launched AI platform consolidating all workflows into single product
- Reducing sales cycles from 6-9 months to target <120 days
	- Recent pipeline deals converting in <30 days
- Shifting from cost-plus to value-based pricing model
	- New medication adherence wedge: $200K per measure with Clover (3 measures)
	- Requires legal work to restructure existing agreements
- Managing offshore team restrictions for larger national payers

### Next Steps & Pipeline Development

- Belong Health contract renegotiation at 4pm today (proposal may reduce from $500K)
- Clover Care discussion Friday on 3-measure medication adherence deal
- Exploring Centene opportunity in Nashville/Mississippi region
- New sales executive starting to expand network beyond existing pipeline
- Gerald to share deck with Virtue team for feedback

### Revenue Status & 2026 Goals

- Seeking to close two deals at $300K+ each by year-end (would reach $2M+ ARR)
	- Hospice deal and CHAP (accreditation body) both at board approval stage
	- CHAP deal particularly valuable as partnership opportunity - recognized by all home health/hospice enterprises
- 2026 target: $10M ARR through expansion strategy
	- Clinical Data Analyst product entering development phase
	- Initial expansion revenue $50-100K off existing $200-300K contracts

### Commercial Strategy & New Hire

- Hired salesperson with $4-5M annual quota for home health/hospice market
	- Former operator of Homecare 100 conference (top 100 hospices/home health companies)
	- Extensive relationship network, planning to “burn the book” of contacts
	- Positioned as “hired gun” rather than strategic commercial leader
- Enterprise focus for post-acute market going forward
- Health systems: targeting one referenceable customer by Q1-Q2 2026

### Product & Engineering Moat Development

- Primary 2026 focus: building defensible product foundation
	- Current deployment timeline 6-12 weeks, need to reduce significantly
	- Moving from human-in-the-loop to automated solutions
	- Head of engineering role needed but not yet prioritized
- Clinical Data Analyst wedge strategy
	- Targeting CNO/CMO departments for patient safety and quality use cases
	- 80-90% of queries can convert to expansion products
	- Three active health system conversations: Beth Israel, Marin Health, Jackson Memorial

### Team Building Discussion

- Current approach: hiring specialists for specific functions vs building executive team
- Virtue perspective: top-performing companies prioritize A+ talent density early
	- Reference examples: SmartIX, Translucent success stories
	- Concern about “hired gun” approach vs strategic leadership
- Acknowledged need to collect data points on optimal hiring approach
- Recognition that new hire already attracting enterprise interest

**Updated:** 2025-12-09T17:31:00.520Z

### Company Background and Strategy

- Rob Davenport, Founder at Squid IQ - platform for medical device utilization management
- Origin story: Discovered problem while working with NY Hospital Association on supply chain localization (2018)
	- Chief supply chain officer: “We know what devices we purchased, have no idea what we own”
	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision

### Current Traction & Revenue Performance

- Current ARR at ~$1.4-1.5M across four active contracts
	- Vituity: $420K (monthly, cleanest contract structure)
	- Astrana: ~$500K (mix of HEDIS reviews and claims, some revenue expected to decline)
	- Belong Health: $300K ($25K/month, currently unprofitable but fixing contract)
	- Clover: $250K (annual contract, converting to monthly)
- Strong unit economics emerging: 80% gross margins, 50% OPEX margins on new contracts
- Pipeline shows ~$4M potential without new sales exec’s network

### Series A Fundraising Strategy

- Pressure from Floodgate (Anya) and NEA (Blake) to raise Series A
- Blake confirmed company has late-stage Series A metrics already
- Gerald targeting 2-2.5M ARR with monthly payments before raising
- Considering strategic investors (Intermountain, Heritage) over traditional VCs initially
- Planning to attend JPM conference to start investor conversations
- Doesn’t need capital (20 months runway) but recognizes hiring/recruiting advantages of Series A

### Product & Operations Evolution

- Launched AI platform consolidating all workflows into single product
- Reducing sales cycles from 6-9 months to target <120 days
	- Recent pipeline deals converting in <30 days
- Shifting from cost-plus to value-based pricing model
	- New medication adherence wedge: $200K per measure with Clover (3 measures)
	- Requires legal work to restructure existing agreements
- Managing offshore team restrictions for larger national payers

### Next Steps & Pipeline Development

- Belong Health contract renegotiation at 4pm today (proposal may reduce from $500K)
- Clover Care discussion Friday on 3-measure medication adherence deal
- Exploring Centene opportunity in Nashville/Mississippi region
- New sales executive starting to expand network beyond existing pipeline

### Revenue Status & 2026 Goals

- Seeking to close two deals at $300K+ each by year-end (would reach $2M+ ARR)

	- Positioned as “hired gun” rather than strategic commercial leader
- Enterprise focus for post-acute market going forward
- Health systems: targeting one referenceable customer by Q1-Q2 2026

### Product & Engineering Moat Development

- Primary 2026 focus: building defensible product foundation
	- Current deployment timeline 6-12 weeks, need to reduce significantly
	- Moving from human-in-the-loop to automated solutions
	- Head of engineering role needed but not yet prioritized
- Clinical Data Analyst wedge strategy
	- Targeting CNO/CMO departments for patient safety and quality use cases
	- 80-90% of queries can convert to expansion products
	- Three active health system conversations: Beth Israel, Marin Health, Jackson Memorial

### Team Building Discussion

- Current approach: hiring specialists for specific functions vs building executive team
- Virtue perspective: top-performing companies prioritize A+ talent density early
	- Reference examples: SmartIX, Translucent success stories
	- Concern about “hired gun” approach vs strategic leadership
- Acknowledged need to collect data points on optimal hiring approach

**Updated:** 2025-12-09T17:31:00.520Z

### Company Background and Strategy

- Rob Davenport, Founder at Squid IQ - platform for medical device utilization management
- Origin story: Discovered problem while working with NY Hospital Association on supply chain localization (2018)
	- Chief supply chain officer: “We know what devices we purchased, have no idea what we own”
	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision

**Updated:** 2025-12-09T17:31:00.520Z

### Company Background and Strategy

- Rob Davenport, Founder at Squid IQ - platform for medical device utilization management
- Origin story: Discovered problem while working with NY Hospital Association on supply chain localization (2018)
	- Chief supply chain officer: “We know what devices we purchased, have no idea what we own”
	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision

**Updated:** 2025-12-09T17:31:00.520Z

### Company Background and Strategy

- Rob Davenport, Founder at Squid IQ - platform for medical device utilization management
- Origin story: Discovered problem while working with NY Hospital Association on supply chain localization (2018)
	- Chief supply chain officer: “We know what devices we purchased, have no idea what we own”
	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision

	- Belong Health: $300K ($25K/month, currently unprofitable but fixing contract)
	- Clover: $250K (annual contract, converting to monthly)
- Strong unit economics emerging: 80% gross margins, 50% OPEX margins on new contracts
- Pipeline shows ~$4M potential without new sales exec’s network

### Series A Fundraising Strategy

- Pressure from Floodgate (Anya) and NEA (Blake) to raise Series A
- Blake confirmed company has late-stage Series A metrics already
- Gerald targeting 2-2.5M ARR with monthly payments before raising
- Considering strategic investors (Intermountain, Heritage) over traditional VCs initially
- Planning to attend JPM conference to start investor conversations
- Doesn’t need capital (20 months runway) but recognizes hiring/recruiting advantages of Series A

### Product & Operations Evolution

- Launched AI platform consolidating all workflows into single product
- Reducing sales cycles from 6-9 months to target <120 days
	- Recent pipeline deals converting in <30 days
- Shifting from cost-plus to value-based pricing model
	- New medication adherence wedge: $200K per measure with Clover (3 measures)
	- Requires legal work to restructure existing agreements
- Managing offshore team restrictions for larger national payers

### Next Steps & Pipeline Development

- Belong Health contract renegotiation at 4pm today (proposal may reduce from $500K)
- Clover Care discussion Friday on 3-measure medication adherence deal

### Company Background and Strategy

- Rob Davenport, Founder at Squid IQ - platform for medical device utilization management
- Origin story: Discovered problem while working with NY Hospital Association on supply chain localization (2018)
	- Chief supply chain officer: “We know what devices we purchased, have no idea what we own”
	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision

### Current Traction & Revenue Performance

- Current ARR at ~$1.4-1.5M across four active contracts
	- Vituity: $420K (monthly, cleanest contract structure)
	- Astrana: ~$500K (mix of HEDIS reviews and claims, some revenue expected to decline)
	- Belong Health: $300K ($25K/month, currently unprofitable but fixing contract)
	- Clover: $250K (annual contract, converting to monthly)
- Strong unit economics emerging: 80% gross margins, 50% OPEX margins on new contracts
- Pipeline shows ~$4M potential without new sales exec’s network

### Series A Fundraising Strategy

- Pressure from Floodgate (Anya) and NEA (Blake) to raise Series A
- Blake confirmed company has late-stage Series A metrics already
- Gerald targeting 2-2.5M ARR with monthly payments before raising
- Considering strategic investors (Intermountain, Heritage) over traditional VCs initially
- Planning to attend JPM conference to start investor conversations
- Doesn’t need capital (20 months runway) but recognizes hiring/recruiting advantages of Series A

### Product & Operations Evolution

- Launched AI platform consolidating all workflows into single product
- Reducing sales cycles from 6-9 months to target <120 days
	- Recent pipeline deals converting in <30 days
- Shifting from cost-plus to value-based pricing model
	- New medication adherence wedge: $200K per measure with Clover (3 measures)
	- Requires legal work to restructure existing agreements
- Managing offshore team restrictions for larger national payers

### Next Steps & Pipeline Development

- Belong Health contract renegotiation at 4pm today (proposal may reduce from $500K)
- Clover Care discussion Friday on 3-measure medication adherence deal
- Exploring Centene opportunity in Nashville/Mississippi region
- New sales executive starting to expand network beyond existing pipeline
- Gerald to share deck with Virtue team for feedback

### Revenue Status & 2026 Goals

- Seeking to close two deals at $300K+ each by year-end (would reach $2M+ ARR)
	- Hospice deal and CHAP (accreditation body) both at board approval stage
	- CHAP deal particularly valuable as partnership opportunity - recognized by all home health/hospice enterprises
- 2026 target: $10M ARR through expansion strategy
	- Clinical Data Analyst product entering development phase
	- Initial expansion revenue $50-100K off existing $200-300K contracts

	- Positioned as “hired gun” rather than strategic commercial leader
- Enterprise focus for post-acute market going forward
- Health systems: targeting one referenceable customer by Q1-Q2 2026

### Product & Engineering Moat Development

- Primary 2026 focus: building defensible product foundation
	- Current deployment timeline 6-12 weeks, need to reduce significantly
	- Moving from human-in-the-loop to automated solutions
	- Head of engineering role needed but not yet prioritized
- Clinical Data Analyst wedge strategy
	- Targeting CNO/CMO departments for patient safety and quality use cases
	- 80-90% of queries can convert to expansion products
	- Three active health system conversations: Beth Israel, Marin Health, Jackson Memorial

### Team Building Discussion

- Current approach: hiring specialists for specific functions vs building executive team
- Virtue perspective: top-performing companies prioritize A+ talent density early
	- Reference examples: SmartIX, Translucent success stories
	- Concern about “hired gun” approach vs strategic leadership
- Acknowledged need to collect data points on optimal hiring approach

	- Clover: $250K (annual contract, converting to monthly)

### Revenue Status & 2026 Goals

- Seeking to close two deals at $300K+ each by year-end (would reach $2M+ ARR)
	- Hospice deal and CHAP (accreditation body) both at board approval stage
	- CHAP deal particularly valuable as partnership opportunity - recognized by all home health/hospice enterprises
- 2026 target: $10M ARR through expansion strategy
	- Clinical Data Analyst product entering development phase
	- Initial expansion revenue $50-100K off existing $200-300K contracts

### Commercial Strategy & New Hire

- Hired salesperson with $4-5M annual quota for home health/hospice market
	- Former operator of Homecare 100 conference (top 100 hospices/home health companies)
	- Extensive relationship network, planning to “burn the book” of contacts
	- Positioned as “hired gun” rather than strategic commercial leader
- Enterprise focus for post-acute market going forward
- Health systems: targeting one referenceable customer by Q1-Q2 2026

### Product & Engineering Moat Development

- Primary 2026 focus: building defensible product foundation
	- Current deployment timeline 6-12 weeks, need to reduce significantly
	- Moving from human-in-the-loop to automated solutions
	- Head of engineering role needed but not yet prioritized
- Clinical Data Analyst wedge strategy
	- Targeting CNO/CMO departments for patient safety and quality use cases
	- 80-90% of queries can convert to expansion products
	- Three active health system conversations: Beth Israel, Marin Health, Jackson Memorial

### Team Building Discussion

- Current approach: hiring specialists for specific functions vs building executive team
- Virtue perspective: top-performing companies prioritize A+ talent density early
	- Reference examples: SmartIX, Translucent success stories
	- Concern about “hired gun” approach vs strategic leadership
- Acknowledged need to collect data points on optimal hiring approach
- Recognition that new hire already attracting enterprise interest

### Next Steps

### Company Background and Strategy

- Rob Davenport, Founder at Squid IQ - platform for medical device utilization management
- Origin story: Discovered problem while working with NY Hospital Association on supply chain localization (2018)
	- Chief supply chain officer: “We know what devices we purchased, have no idea what we own”
	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision
