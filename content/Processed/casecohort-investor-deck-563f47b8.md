## Slide 4: Persistent margin pressures will impact providers’ purchasing and investment behaviors
Persistent margin pressures will impact providers’ purchasing and investment behaviors

**Major drivers of provider operating margins**

| Category                   | 2022 Value | 2027 Value | Change |
| :------------------------- | :--------- | :--------- | :----- |
| Operating margin,¹ 2022    | -5.4%      |            |        |
| Net rate increases         | 4.4% ↑     |            |        |
| Headwinds²                 | -6.5%      |            |        |
| Heightened inflation       | -7.5%      |            |        |
| Operating margin,¹ 2027    |            | -15%       |        |

**Headwinds**
*   Reimbursements are fixed and not matching inflation
*   Labor shortages driving ~20% spike in labor costs
*   Supply expense per discharge increasing owing to supply inflation and stocking issues
*   COVID emergency funds expiring
*   Vertical integration changing consumer choices
*   Nonoperating income has declined; endowments no longer delivering income to fund operations

**Tailwinds**
*   Anticipated decrease in interest rates
*   Evolving digital reimbursement landscape
*   Decreasing turnover rate for registered nurses on staff (5% decline in 2022)
*   Payers and providers more open to value-based reimbursement

The MedTech industry is struggling to adapt, despite mounting pressures on gross margins

**Unsustainably high costs**
The productivity of sales reps has remained roughly the same over the past decade

35-40% VS 10-20%

Typical MedTech spend on SG&A as percent of revenue
Typical technology or industrial spend on SG&A as percent of revenue

**Underdeveloped commercial skills**
Commercial teams are organized around expensive in-person, relationship-based sales motions (milkmen)
