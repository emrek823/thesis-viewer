The battle for control of the specialty patient continues, profit models are becoming more opaque, and vertically aligned channels pose market access risks. To build a big business ($1B+) in this space with high gross margins (50%+), you have to choose which stakeholders to partner with and where you will take other's margins.

The market is extremely consolidated with insurers, PBMs, and SPs vertically integrating. The top four specialty pharmacies have 75% market share, the top 3 wholesalers have more than 90% market share, and thee top 3 PBMs have 80% market share

## Slide 2: Medical vs. Pharmacy - Buy-and-bill, White-bagging, In-office dispensing, SP dispensing

| | Medical | Pharmacy |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| | **Buy-and-bill** | **White-bagging** | **In-office dispensing** | **SP dispensing** |
| **Providers** | Margin (ASP + 4-6%) on drugs + reimbursement for administration, technology investment | Reimbursement for admin only ($100-$300 / infusion), prior auth issues | Margin on drugs (~$50K - $100K / year profit) but smaller compared to infused | No revenue |
| **Specialty Pharmacy (SP)** | Services and analytics only | 5-10% gross margins on drugs | Services and analytics only | 5-10% gross margins on drugs |
| **PBMs** | Rebate from manufacturer but lack of control over drug choices | More negotiating power, higher rebate | Rebates and direct and indirect renumeration (DIR) | Rebates and direct and indirect renumeration (DIR) |
| **Pharma Manufacturers** | Direct to provider/patient channel | More focused, limited drug-distribution strategy | Offer higher list prices to increase rebates for PBMs | Offer higher list prices to increase rebates for PBMs |
| **Wholesalers / Distributors** | Higher margins on drugs without SP in process | SP reduce margins with negotiating power and sometimes bypass wholesalers altogether | Higher margins with SP cut out of loop | Lower margins with negotiating power of SPs |
| **Plan sponsor** | Focused on shifting to less expensive sites of care | Limit network to own SP to control utilization | Potential for cost savings from split-fill, reduced medication waste | Trying to limit dispensing to SP they own |
| **Patients** | Higher quality, more convenient | Difficulties coordinating medications and insurance | Higher quality, more convenient | Difficulties coordinating medications and and insurance |

▼ **Autoimmune Overview:** Specialty drug spend is ~70% of annual costs for growing autoimmune population. Growing specialty pharma spend on a relative and absolute basis has made autoimmune specialty drug spending a top budget concern for payers.

**Autoimmune: Heterogeneous patient population with large unmet need**
~7% of US population has an autoimmune disease

| Disease | US Patients | Disease Burden |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Psoriasis (PsO) | 8,000,000 | $112B/year in total costs |
| Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) | 1,300,000 | $39B/year in total costs |
| Ulcerative colitis (UC) | 640,000 | $30B/year in total costs |
| Crohn's disease | 564,000 | |

## Slide 4: Drivers of Specialty and Non-Specialty Trend

### Autoimmune Conditions Were the Greatest Contributor to Specialty Growth...
In 2021, specialty growth was largely driven by utilization increases of specialty treatments in certain categories, including autoimmune and asthma/atopic dermatitis. The increase in utilization was driven by new therapies and indications, as well as changes to guidelines for conditions like psoriasis and eczema that made more people eligible for treatment.

**Pie Chart Data: Autoimmune Treatments Accounted for More Than Half of All Specialty Utilization Trend**

| Category | Percentage |
| :--------------- | :--------- |
| Autoimmune | 54% |
| Asthma/Atopic Dermatitis | 36% |
| Oncology | 6% |
| Infertility | 2% |
| Hormonal Therapies | 2% |

### Growth of the Autoimmune and Asthma/Atopic Dermatitis Classes Largely Stemmed from Increased Utilization, Not Higher Prices

| | Utilization Trend | Price Growth |
| :---------------------- | :---------------- | :----------- |
| Autoimmune | +8.8% | +0.9% |
| Asthma/Atopic Dermatitis | +34.6% | -3.8% |

▼ **Providers:** If given the tools and resources, providers can drive additional margin through dispensing and administering drugs

**Medical benefit** - Hospital outpatient departments (HOPD) charge an additional site markup and moving infusions into the home or office can reduce costs ~50%. Providers are less

### HOPD vs Office Cost Analysis for Remicade and Biosimilar

| | **HOPD** | **Office** |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| | **Remicade** | **Biosimilar** | **Remicade** | **Biosimilar** |
| Cost/dose | $4,914.80 | $3,184.16 | $4,914.80 | $3,184.16 |
| $ to Physician (buy-and-bill) | $491.48 | $318.42 | $491.48 | $318.42 |
| Site Markup | $5,601 | $5,601 | $695 | $695 |
| Total to plan | $11,007.28 | $9,103.58 | $6,101.28 | $4,197.58 |
| % Savings vs. Remicade HOPD | | 17.29% | 44.57% | 61.87% |

**Pharmacy benefit** - For an example practice below dispensing ~3500 medications / year (22 providers, 11 locations), they are able to generate an additional $3M in profit / year at >10% margins.

## Slide 9: Year-over-Year Performance and Specialty Pharmacy Profitability

### Year-over-Year Performance

**Bar Chart Data: Revenue**
*   2018: ~$17,000
*   2019: ~$21,000
*   2020: ~$23,000

**Bar Chart Data: Profit**
*   2018: ~$1,000
*   2019: ~$2,500
*   2020: ~$3,000

**Bar Chart Data: Dispenses**
*   2018: ~$1,750
*   2019: ~$3,000
*   2020: ~$3,250

*(Values are approximate based on visual representation of the charts in thousands)*

▼ **Specialty Pharmacies (SPs):** Pushing for increased control of utilization to maintain margins on dispensing drugs while navigating incentives of PBM/health plan

Specialty pharmacies make 4%-5% gross margins (2-3% EBITDA margins) by purchasing drugs from distributors / manufacturers (WAC, lower price) and receiving reimbursement from payers (AWP, higher price). SPs increasingly facing pricing pressures from payers.

### How we make money and grow profitability (Illustrative example)

**How we make money (Flow Diagram Data)**
*   **Payors** (AWP_Y%) send money ($10,000 Revenue) to **DIPLOMAT**
*   **DIPLOMAT** sends money ($9,600 COGS) to **Distributors / pharmaceutical manufacturers** (WAC-X%)
*   **Distributors / pharmaceutical manufacturers** send Physical drug movement ($ flows) to **Patient**
*   **Patient** receives Physical drug movement from Distributors / pharmaceutical manufacturers

**Example:**
*   AWP $11,905
*   WAC $9,921
*   AWP $11,905 - 16% = $10,000 Revenue
*   WAC $9,921 - 3% = $9,600 COGS
*   Gross Profit = $400
*   Gross Margin = 4%

*(1) Note AWP = WAC x 1.20*

### Drug mix and positive pricing trends are tremendous profit tailwinds for Diplomat

**Table: Diplomat's 3Q'16 Average***

| Our core focus | | Traditional Drug | Specialty Drug A | Specialty Drug B | Specialty Drug C | Specialty Drug B (10% price incr.) |
| :------------- | :------------ | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------- |
| | Revenue | $100 | $3,700 | $10,000 | $27,000 | $11,000 |
| | Gross Profit ($) | $10 | $185 | $305 | $400 | $810 | $440 |
| | Gross Margin (%) | 10% | 5% | 4% | 3% | 4% |

**Movement:**
*   Diplomat mix shift movement over time
*   Inflation Impact

Specialty pharmacies also provide brand support services, supply chain solutions, patient support services in addition to dispensing specialty medications.

## Slide 10: Specialty Care Group Business Model & Payers

### Specialty Care Group Business Model: Economics Vary Across Operational Platforms

| | Brand Support Services | Supply Chain Solutions | Patient Support Services | Specialty Pharmacy | End of Life Care |
| :-------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------- | :--------------- |
| **Customer** | | Manufacturer | | Third Party Payers | Hospices |
| **Revenue** | Fee-for-Service Model | Fee-for-Service Model | Fee-for-Service Model | Buy/Sell Model | Per Diem Model |
| **Product** | Manufacturer Owns the Product | Manufacturer Owns the Product | Manufacturer Owns the Product | Specialty Care Group Owns the Product | Specialty Care Group Owns the Product |

▼ **Payers:** Potential to reduce costs through changing site-of-care and reducing drug costs, but forced to deal with internal incentives of PBMs/SPs they own.

Autoimmune is the top category for specialty drug spend for payers.

### Top 10 Drug Categories²

| | Category | % Spend\* | Trend\*\* |
| :- | :----------------------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| 1 | Autoimmune | 16.8% | 19.0% |
| 2 | Diabetes | 14.6% | 2.4% |
| 3 | HIV | 6.1% | 17.1% |
| 4 | Cancer (oral) | 6.1% | 22.7% |
| 5 | Multiple sclerosis | 4.5% | -3.3% |
| 6 | Respiratory | 4.1% | -2.7% |
| 7 | ADHD | 3.6% | -2.7% |
| 8 | Pain | 3.0% | -15.3% |
| 9 | Hepatitis C | 1.8% | -49.7% |
| 10 | Anticonvulsant | 2.5% | 4.5% |

Payers have 2 levers to drive down costs:
*   **Lowering drug costs (medical + pharmacy):** Sometimes complicated given incentives of PBM and SPs they own
*   **Changing site of care (medical):** HOPD charge site markup that is 10x office-based or home infusion. More direct savings (50%) by changing site of care (buy-and-bill or white-bagging).

## Slide 11: Reimbursement Solutions and White Bagging Policies

### Reimbursement Solutions
Incentivize providers to dispense lower-cost medications by adjusting provider reimbursements

**Bar Chart Data: Reimbursement Solutions (Provider Margin and Drug Cost)**

| Drug | Provider Margin | Drug Cost |
| :--- | :-------------- | :-------- |
| Aloxi | ~$100 | ~$90 |
| Zofran | ~$100 | ~$90 |
| Zofran (with adjustment) | ~$180 | ~$90 |

*(Values are approximate based on visual representation)*

### Site of Care
Shift members to lowest-cost infusion location by applying medical drug management policies

Moving one member from hospital to home infusion may save group $30,600/year

**Site of Care Costs (Remicade infusion)**

| Location | Cost |
| :------- | :----- |
| Hospital | $9,400 |
| Doctor Office/Clinic | ~$6,500 | *(estimated visually)* |
| Member's Home | $4,300 |

White bagging can boost profits and revenues for PBM-owned specialty pharmacies while increasing payers' control over hard-to-manage medical benefit drugs.

### UnitedHealthcare, White Bagging Policies, by Pharmacy, 2021

| Pharmacy | Parent Organization | Products (Total = 78) |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Accredo Health Group | Cigna (Express Scripts) | 59 |

▼ **Wholesalers/Distributors:** Facing margin pressures from large SPs and working to provide additional value-add services to entire supply chain

Wholesalers are facing pressures on their business model for reasons listed below, but the typical strategy is to buy in bulk from manufacturers to get discounts on price then sell to

## Slide 12: Wholesalers/Distributors & Manufacturers

pharmacies or providers at a margin. A drug with a $50K list price has a $30K net price after rebates and discounts. A wholesaler earns fees and discounts equal to ~5% of the list price. The wholesaler therefore absorbs 8% of the manufacturer's net price for distribution services.

Wholesalers purchase and take title (legal ownership) to a manufacturer's product and absorb credit risk when reselling a manufacturer's products. The two biggest components of wholesalers' current assets are (1) the product inventories purchased from manufacturers and owned by the wholesaler, and (2) the accounts receivables that customers owe to wholesalers

This business model is being challenged for a number of reasons:

*   **Increasing power of SPs:** Large, insurer-owned SPs have the increased negotiating power and drive down margins on sell-side. In some cases, larger specialty pharmacies purchase products directly from the manufacturer of a specialty drug, bypassing specialty distributors and full-line wholesalers.
*   **Challenges to fees based on list-price:** With increases in list prices over time, stakeholders in the specialty pharmacy chain are trying to push towards fixed prices based on units or fees based on net-pricing (includes rebates).

*   https://www.drugchannels.net/2018/07/building-new-drug-wholesaler.html

▼ **Manufacturers:** Offer rebates (list price - net price) to get on formulary while working with wholesalers and distributors to increase access at launch and ensure adherence to medication

Formulary exclusions have emerged as a powerful tool for PBMs to gain additional negotiating leverage against manufacturers. The prospect of exclusion leads manufacturers to offer deeper rebates to avoid being cut from the formulary. Exclusions are a key factor behind the growing gap between list and net prices for brand-name drugs.
