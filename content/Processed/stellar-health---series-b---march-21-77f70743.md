## Slide 4: What is Value-Based Care?
stellarhealth
What is Value-Based Care?
The change that created opportunity

**Health Plans ("Payors")**
Payors receive a fixed amount of money, a
portion of which is tied to performance and
quality, to cover medical services

The leftover after covering services (the
Medical Loss Ratio or “MLR") and admin
costs are the payors' profits

**Value-based payment**
Payors pay providers for services
rendered to patients

A portion of providers' payments
are tied to various measures of
performance
and quality

**Providers**
Providers receive payments for
their services

Providers' incomes are ultimately
tied to their measures of
performance and quality

## Slide 6: The Solution to a Difficult Problem
stellarhealth
The Solution to a Difficult Problem
The key to success is changing physician behavior to align with new objectives,
unfortunately breaking bad habits is hard to do

**Insurers (represented by logos: Cigna, aetna, CMS.gov, BlueCross BlueShield, Anthem, Humana)**
*   "Use these fancy analytics to fix your HEDIS Quality Scores"
*   "Change everything you do so that I can make more money!"
*   "Improve your MLR!"

**Insurers face ballooning medical spend**
(90% of P&L) and poor quality; bloated
with legacy infrastructure, constrained
budgets; knee-jerking by forcing plethora
of new tasks, analytics and risk-sharing
onto frustrated physicians

**Physicians (represented by stethoscope icon and questioning person icon)**
$
? ? ? ? ?

**Physicians are struggling**
with rule changes (MIPS, MACRA),
declining profits and payors pushing
them on new metrics that feel impossible
to impact; cannot shift focus from volume
to "value" without risk of insolvency

**Intuitive Solution Required**
changing behavior is never easy; it
requires a system that fits into your
existing way of doing things while also
rewarding you in the near-term to
reinforce the new behavior: **Stellar Health**

## Slide 7: The Stellar App
stellarhealth
The Stellar App
The Stellar App is a web-based, point-of-care workflow tool designed to prompt
and reward providers and practice staff for delivering high-quality care

**Screenshot of Stellar App:**
**Conduct Outreach**
Address prioritized care opportunities and follow up on screenings for Stellar patients.
**Scheduled Screenings**
Recent Scheduled Screenings (37)
| Patient | DO... | Action | Status | SVU |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ruby Smith | Complete Breast Cancer Screening | Scheduled at Gold Standard Radiology for 01/20/20 | Scheduled | 10 |
| Emily Evans | Complete Colorectal Cancer Screening | Scheduled at None for 12/31/19 | Scheduled | 20 |
| Nelson | Complete Colorectal Cancer Screening | Scheduled at None for 12/18/19 | Scheduled | 20 |
Show next 10 actions.

*   The Stellar App delivers a **simple checklist of**
    **recommended value-based actions** for providers and
    staff based on each patient's historical data

*   Stellar partners with risk-bearing entities to set aside
    **extra funding to reward the completion of these**
    **actions** not found on normal fee schedules

*   Instead of waiting 12-18 months to get paid, **bonus**
    **checks are paid monthly** to providers and staff

*   Providers can receive **real-time claims data across all**
    **payors through one platform** and can say goodbye to
    multiple portals and care gap spreadsheets!

## Slide 8: How the Stellar App Works
Stellarhealth
How the Stellar App Works
Stellar's incentive structure empowers providers to spend the extra time needed to take
actions that improve MLR and Quality during the patient visit

**Status Quo**
PCP addresses
acute issue,
bills $100 for 15
min. visit, and
then rushes to
next patient to
hit volume
target, missing
additional
value-based
actions that
could be
completed for
the patient

| Conditions addressed | Insurer receives |
|----------------------|------------------|
| J20.9 (Acute Bronchitis) | $0 |
| I10 (Hypertension) | $0 |
| **Total** | **$0** |

$100 RVU
VS.

**Stellar Health**
Stellar prompts
provider to
address chronic
conditions &
quality
measures

| Conditions addressed | Insurer receives |
|----------------------|------------------|
| J20.9 (Acute Bronchitis) | $0 |
| I10 (Hypertension) | $0 |
| E11.40 (Diab w/ Comp.) | $501^1 |
| I50.9 (CHF) | $509^1 |
| Need Mammogram | $150^2 |
| Need Diabetic Eye Exam | $150^2 |
| **Total** | **$1,309** |

$100 RVU
$120 SVU™

PCP gets **+$120**
for closing gaps
in real-time

Insurer gets
**+$1,309** for
improved MLR
& quality scores

Patient avoids
**ER and $$$**

1.  Incremental value driven by the marginal extra diagnoses.
2.  Incremental value driven on Quality measures based on specific Star movements.

## Slide 9: What is Stellar's Business Model?
stellarhealth
What is Stellar's Business Model?
Our business model creates value for payors by getting physician and staff rewarded
for carrying out the specific activities that the payors want done

**Payors**
Receive higher quality score
and increased revenue from
extra actions completed by
physicians

10K MA Lives x $5pmpm
= $600K incentive pool

**$6 million**
**of value generated**

**Stellar Health**
Receives annual service fee and a
performance bonus tied to results

**5 - 10x**
**Gross ROI**
3 - 6x Net ROI
inclusive of Stellar
fees of $300K

**Physicians**
Receive free platform to
help with actions and earn
additional payments for
completing those actions

500 actions completed in month
= $15K monthly check

**$50 - 100K extra in**
**take-home pay per doc**

$600K / 20K possible actions
= $30 avg. payment per action

## Slide 12: Stellar's Traction: Scaling with National Payor
stellarhealth
Stellar's Traction: Scaling with National Payor
In 2019, Stellar proved it works to a large national payor and is now scaling against that

**Stellar was able to convert and enroll**
**75%+**
of Provider groups
handed to us by
the Payor

**Stellar drove**
**+0.6 Stars**
Quality Improvement / or +60%
on the HEDIS measures for
quality (all this in a partial-year
with only 6 months)

**Stellar is truly a**
**step-change to how things**
**have been done; if you look at**
**the results of the same**
**patients year-over-year, we**
**have moved this group up to**
**4.5 – 5**
★★★★★
star levels (up from 2.3 star avg.)

With these astounding results, Stellar proved it to the large national payor,
and we have now **renewed and expanded 3 - 4x in lives managed for 2020**

## Slide 13: Stellar's Traction: Success with Regional Payor
stellarhealth
Stellar's Traction: Success with Regional Payor
In 2020, Stellar worked with a regional payor in NY to make significant improvements in
engaging participating IPAs and independent practices

**Background:** The client is a small regional plan with Medicare, Duals and Special Needs patients managed by provider practices in
several IPAs in New York as well as other independent and health system affiliated practices. Stellar was brought in to improve
performance and engagement. Stellar helped the regional payor support its VBC efforts with these providers by improving star ratings,
diagnosis recapture - surpassing all contracted performance goals

**Client Detail:**
*   2.5K Lives (Onboarded)
*   91 Medical Groups (Onboarded)
*   115 Providers (Onboarded)

**Key Initiatives:**
*   Created a VBC model with client specifically to incentivize quality and coding
*   Launched Transitions of Care Module - (Started 6 months after launch once provider engagement was achieved with initially unengaged groups)
*   Serving as a Supplemental Data Feed for certain measures

**Partnership Context**
*   **A Platform to Engage**
    Stellar's platform and incentive design is built to fit into a practice's workflow,
    engage providers and drive performance

*   **VBC Strategy and Expertise**
    Stellar's model is built to help payors perform in value-based care such that provider
    entities can take on more risk, scale, and move down the VBC continuum. Given its
    expertise, Stellar is very aligned with the client's quality / VBC strategy such that the
    client is heavily relying on Stellar (included in MA bid)

*   **Strong IPA Relationships**
    Stellar's strong foothold in NY as well as the deep relationships it had already
    built with IPAs in the state, allowed for a seamless onboarding of providers that
    had the client's membership

FAQs

**Why start with Medicare Advantage?** MA is a growing, fragmented market with the largest revenue potential for MLR
solutions. There are 3,500 individual plans covering 24m members that each generate c.$11,000 in annual premiums
for insurers, or $240b of annual MLR spend. We capture 25% of the 20% MLR improvement that we create for the
insurer, or $12b of potential SH revenue.

**Why focus on enabling primary care physicians?** Primary care physicians only generate 2% of the MLR spend, but they
directly impact 90% of total spend. Targeting and micro-managing large line items like oncology and pharmacy, is
downstream and less likely to generate outsized returns on investment.

**Why have many pop health analytics failed to deliver consistent impact?** Several new companies provide helpful data
analytics; however, they are unable to effectively motivate local provider behavior change that is critical for execution.
Wide scale behavior change requires trust, consistent education, granular incentives paid frequently, and tactical
guidance at the point-of-care.

**Why don't existing risk-sharing arrangements and incentives work?** Existing shared savings pools are ineffective
because physicians do not believe other physicians in their risk pool will follow through. An analogy is giving a line
worker equity in a company; he does not believe he can singularly impact the entire company's value. Instead, he
requires granular instructions, targets and bonuses for motivation.

**What are the barriers to entry for others who might replicate?** Moving MLR requires a trusted partner in the physician
community that generates additional new income, makes life easier and improves quality. Software alone has never
worked. An effective MLR engine is indispensable to the insurer and providers.

|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Description**         | New generation of primary care that invests heavily in technology and staff to manage more risk for smaller panels of patients | Broad technology platforms focused on managing population health using analytics across a large number of patients | Technology solutions specifically designed for closing patient care gaps at the point-of-care (Stellar's closest competitors) |
| **Competitors**         | PRIVIA HEALTH, iorahealth, Aledade, OAK STREET HEALTH                                     | Inovalon, Epic, evolent HEALTH, Lumeris, wellcentive                                      | Lightbeam Health Solutions, arcadia HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS, innovaccer, Vatica HEALTH |
| **Disadvantages Compared to Stellar** | * Extremely capital intensive and resource heavy<br>* Does not represent the majority of primary care providers<br>* Requires buying or investing in practices, not just training | * Significant capital investment and long implementation time<br>* Analytics does not translate to changes in physician behavior at the point-of-care<br>* Lack of focus on primary care | * Missing granular, real-time incentive payments<br>* Inability to work across all insurer types<br>* Built for systems and not aligned to staff workflow |

Stellar was built to serve primary care providers often overlooked by existing competitors, either because of their size or
current level of sophistication, and was specifically designed to change physician behavior at the point-of-care
