### Financial Performance & Clinic Operations

- Wayland clinic achieved profitability
	- Burned $130K to reach break even (budgeted $250-350K)
	- Currently at 40% gross margin, reaching 50-60% in August
	- 30% blended contribution margin
	- Now generating ~$2M cash flow with $250K investment
- Break even timing clarification
	- Revenue recognition vs forward planning confidence
	- Diagnostic evaluations done month before launch
	- Wayland opened with 6 full-time clients, now at 9
	- 6-month timeline from client acquisition to service delivery due to prior auth delays

### Expansion Plans & Market Strategy

- Total clinics end of year: 4 confirmed (Sudbury, Wayland, Weston, Woburn)
	- 5th location in Braintree/Brookline targeting December 1st or January 1st move-in
	- True market coverage once southern location opens
	- 25M top line capacity across all locations
- Market expansion progress
	- Indiana: In network by end of 2025, flag in ground Q2 2026
	- Minnesota: Similar trajectory to Indiana
	- Arizona: Already secured first commercial contracts, 78% gross margin on key service codes
- State expansion challenges
	- Coverage limits hit $50K in ~4 months for young clients
	- Need to understand how competitors navigate Arizona market

### Operational Challenges & Solutions

- BT retention spike concerns
	- Annual retention dropped from 84% to 58% last quarter
	- Industry standard is 77% turnover, so still above average
	- Conducting pulse surveys and floor time with staff
- Compensation restructuring (largely net neutral)
	- Moving all salaried employees to hourly
	- Addressing pay inequity issues
	- Career ladder into salary positions based on center availability
	- May take couple margin points hit but should stabilize retention
- Key growth drivers identified
	- Referral volume - more than can satisfy
	- Real estate - getting into good position
	- BT count - critical bottleneck if retention issues persist
