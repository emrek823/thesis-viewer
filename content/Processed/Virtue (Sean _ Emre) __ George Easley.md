### George’s Background & Investment in Dart

- Angel investor in Dart since 2022 - $20k check when they were dropping out of Berkeley
- Board observer at PaintJet, working with CIO at LifePoint Health (introducing them to Dart this week)
- What attracted him to invest:
	- Each founder walked through professional history despite being only 20 years old
	- Hustle mentality: “we don’t know what we don’t know” in a good way
	- Blissful ignorance combined with strong drive - not aware of supposed limitations
	- Completely a people bet, pre-product v1 of the idea
	- General humility and willingness to be wrong repeatedly

### Dart’s Evolution & Key Characteristics

- Quick iteration cycles and desire to learn rather than know-it-all arrogance
- Super low ego team that survived multiple near-death experiences by spending less
- Business pivots and learning process:
	- Started chasing shiny objects in independent contractor/freelancer space
	- Humble enough to admit they were chasing the wrong thing
	- Transitioned to healthcare compliance after customer discovery
	- 2024 breakthrough: spoke to post-acute care group (SNFs) using clinical note processors
		- “We have no idea what’s actually a good job” - notes exist in EMR but die there
		- Led to digging deeper on what constitutes good performance and consequences of poor work
- Product maturity evolution reflects founder growth:
	- First: consumer-facing app
	- Now: enterprise AI deployment (unsexy but valuable)
- Extreme frugality approach:
	- Always chose frugal option over shiny option
	- Never had physical office even after raising pre-seed from Forge Ventures
	- Hired contractors and talented friends on product side rather than full employees
	- Still working out of other people’s offices/WeWork

### Areas Where Dart Needs Support

- Leadership development:
	- Still very young and lack gravitas for enterprise healthcare sales
	- Need someone with gray hairs who’s seen 12-month procurement cycles with regional hospital systems
	- Don’t know much about infrastructure to build/scale business structurally beyond 10 people
- Go-to-market expansion:
	- Strong network on post-acute care side needed
	- Connections to health systems and acute care delivery settings
	- George’s LifePoint connections limited, needs broader network access
- Team dynamics:
	- Aakruti operates in background while Raj drives conversations
	- Should encourage her to take more outward, pronounced C-level executive role
	- Provide support for her growth into that position
- Recent commercial traction: 70-75% of current revenue gained in last 100 days, just signed largest contract ($200k) yesterday
