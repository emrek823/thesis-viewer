### Update and Theses

- Update since last chat: short story and long story
- 3 theses about world:
	- AI service - everything will become AI service businesses
	- Bending the cost curve in healthcare (linear relationship between cost and labor)
	- VBC as a forcing function to enable that
- Building a fractional COO for primary care practices to scale capacity and optimize VBC
- Long-term goal: Building an AI-native IPA

### VBC Implementation Challenges

- Not doing VBC correctly
- Problem: hiring 3-4 additional people to do VBC would put practices in the red
- AWV / ToC - even with insight layer from Arcadia or others, atomic actions not happening
- Problem with other VBC plays that sell into MSO or IPA: ROI case for individual PCPs difficult
- Aim: Own atomic actions as a service; become true operational infrastructure for practices

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- After talking to office managers, approached practice owners
- Piloting with one practice (18k covered lives) and proving out value
- They want an MSO-type solution; noticed practice not doing VBC work
- Creating service area relationships, starting with one IPA as a model
- Target: “messy middle” of IPAs too small for larger enablers

### Specific Tasks and Infrastructure

- Focus on: AWVs, Transitions of Care, Risk adjustment, referrals
- Building infrastructure layer to spin up workflows quickly
- Spent time in Boston sitting in practice to map workflows
- Hacked together a Karatas-like product in a weekend

### Learnings from VBC Landscape

- Aledade, Agilon: TIN arbitrage, taking 50% of upside
- Cherry-picking physicians who would generate savings anyway
- Many docs left out who could do VBC with more bandwidth
- Problem: Companies send operations consultants, but practices lack capacity
- Race to the bottom - trend towards MSO-like arrangements
- Vytalyze: Traditional MSO and ACO, locks in downside risk
- Honest Health: Charges upfront (e.g. $400K on 10% of projected savings)

### Co-founder and Team

- Co-founder: Obinna Akahara (https://www.linkedin.com/in/obinnaakahara/)
- Head of product engineering at Convergent (AI company for B2B marketing)
- Demonstrated ability to quickly build and ship product (demo at 3AM)

### Long-term Vision

- Make economics of VBC actually viable
- Current VBC enablers not going far enough
- Opportunity to generate more savings by owning more of the work
- Enable other players (e.g. health systems) to do VBC correctly

### Financing Strategy

- Raising small friends and family round ($250-$350k) for 6-8 months runway
- Considering larger raise for 18 months of “wandering” to refine business model
- Exploring $500K from Pear or YC for quick capital
- View on capital: relationship-based, looking for strategic value beyond money

### Additional Insights

- Met with Jenny from Tufts Integrated Network, led to IPA connections
- Upcoming meeting with largest IPA in Massachusetts
- Abhi from Oak Street Health (now at Altitude) interested in solution
- Identified gap in servicing smaller ACOs and IPAs that larger players can’t efficiently address
