# Market Opportunity Vim + Hermes Health

## Executive Summary

*   The U.S. medical record retrieval market is a $2.5B+ opportunity driven by high-volume legal, insurance, and payer demand.
*   Vim, in partnership with Hermes Health, is uniquely positioned to streamline and monetize the record exchange process by offering structured, digital data access directly to Requestors.
*   With 100+ record retrieval vendors as distribution channels, the platform can rapidly scale and capture market share.

## Market Size

The number of medical record requests in the U.S. is enormous. Industry data indicates over ~111 million of monetizable medical record requests are made to healthcare providers each year (scanstat.com). Despite near-universal adoption of electronic health records, about 90% of these medical record requests are still fulfilled via manual methods such as: paper copies, mail, or fax (scanstat.com).

Medical record requests are growing quickly. In 2023 providers in some regions reported record request volumes up 30% year-over-year, driven by more claims audits, risk adjustment activities, and quality reporting needs (mrocorp.com). The overall trend is a steady increase in record retrieval volume going forward, fueled by growing data needs in healthcare and insurance.

### Market Growth Forecast:

The medical record retrieval market will continue expanding robustly over the next 5–10 years. As noted, forecasts around 10% annual growth are common (einpresswire.com). The increasing volume of data-driven healthcare (analytics, audits, and legal data needs) acts as a tailwind. By 2030, the market size (global) is expected to roughly double from current levels (einpresswire.com), and the U.S. will likely see a proportional rise.

### Requestor Types

Medical record retrieval requests can be segmented by the type of Requestor and purpose. Below is an overview of each customer persona category and its relative magnitude:

## Payors: 80,000,000 Requests per Year

Insurance companies represent one of the largest drivers of record retrieval demand, and the insurance segment leads the market in terms of revenue (insightaceanalytic.com). Payors request medical records to process claims, audit payments, perform risk adjustment, and support HEDIS quality reporting. Collectively, insurance-related purposes account for a substantial share of third-party record requests each year. Indeed, industry analyses indicate the insurance segment was the largest application in 2024 (insightaceanalytic.com), reflecting high demand from health plans for charts to support reimbursement and fraud prevention.

The volume is large and growing – for instance, the rise of value-based care has led to more frequent risk-adjustment and quality review requests, with providers seeing spikes in such requests annually (mrocorp.com). Many provider organizations report that payer requests have accelerated in recent years, intensifying as insurers strive to reduce costs and improve care outcomes (mrocorp.com). From a revenue perspective, this category is crucial: insurers or their intermediaries pay for large-scale retrieval projects, making it a major market segment by dollar value.

## Legal: 25,000,000 Requests Per Year

Legal requests form another core segment of the record retrieval market. Law firms (plaintiff and defense) frequently need certified copies of medical records to pursue litigation, particularly in personal injury lawsuits, medical malpractice cases, product liability mass torts, worker's compensation claims, and disability cases. Attorneys rely on record retrieval companies to obtain hospital records, physician records, imaging, and billing records that serve as evidence in depositions and trials (stax.com).

Legal requests often involve complex authorization requirements, court orders, or subpoenas. Vendors serving this market differentiate themselves through attorney-friendly portals, bulk ordering tools, and dedicated support teams for handling provider pushback or clarifying record scopes. Given the scale of litigation in the USA millions of personal injury cases annually, ongoing mass tort cycles (e.g., opioid, talc, PFAS), and aggressive advertising pipelines—this segment is expected to remain one of the largest sources of chart volume and revenue in the industry.

## Life & Disability Insurance: 5,000,000 Requests per Year

Life insurance and disability insurance carriers represent a significant, monetizable segment of the medical record retrieval market. These carriers routinely request patient records to assess risk during underwriting, evaluate claims for disability or death benefits, and detect fraud. Medical records provide critical evidence of pre-existing conditions, diagnostic history, treatment compliance, and the severity of impairments—making them essential to the policy lifecycle.

Unlike providers seeking records for treatment (who receive them at no cost), life and disability insurers pay per record request, typically through authorized vendors or retrieval companies. This makes the segment financially valuable to retrieval platforms and service providers. The underwriting process especially drives volume—records are often pulled during the application stage for high-value or high-risk policies, including term life, whole life, and long-term disability coverage.

Due to the sensitive nature of these requests and the need for thorough documentation, life and disability insurers often require faster turnaround times, HIPAA-compliant audit trails, and structured summaries, making them willing to pay a premium for retrieval services that are accurate, timely, and defensible.

Overall, this segment represents one of the most monetizable use cases in third-party record retrieval—combining consistent demand, high willingness to pay, and a strong incentive for insurers to outsource retrieval for efficiency and compliance.

## Research and Analytics: 1,000,000 request per year

Researchers, clinical trials, or healthcare analytics are starting to request medical records. Organizations conducting retrospective studies may request records from providers (with patient consent or via data networks).

Pharma companies in some cases retrieve records for drug safety investigations or real-world evidence generation. This category is growing with the rise of real-world data in healthcare; however, much of research data access is handled through de-identified aggregated datasets rather than record pulls. As such, research-related record retrieval makes up a relatively small portion of the annual request volume. Nonetheless, the demand for health data in research is noted as a driver for medical record request growth.

Researchers are oftentimes pay a premium when requesting medical records to ensure the provenance of the request.

## Providers / Continuity of Care: Non Monetizable

A large portion of record requests are initiated by hospitals, clinics, or physicians seeking patient records from other providers for ongoing treatment or care coordination. Industry data suggests that provider-to-provider requests constitute on the order of 40–50% of all record request volume (fiercehealthcare.com). For example, when a patient is referred to a specialist or transitions to a new provider, the new provider may retrieve the patient's medical history from the previous provider. These treatment-related exchanges form a significant volume of requests, but they are often fulfilled at no charge to the requester (as part of care continuity and due to legal restrictions on charging for treatment-related disclosures). One major release-of-information (ROI) company (Ciox Health) noted that roughly 40–50% of the record requests it handles are provider-to-provider transfers (fulfilled free of charge) (fiercehealthcare.com). This category is high in volume but typically not a revenue source for the market (since providers don't usually pay fees to retrieve records for treatment purposes).

## Patient Directed: Not Monetizable

Patients themselves have a right under HIPAA to access their medical records. According to data from a leading ROI company, only about 4% of the record requests handled were initiated by patients requesting their own records (fiercehealthcare.com). Patients may request records for personal use, to share with a new provider, or for second opinions. In recent years, patient access through electronic patient portals has grown — for example, by 2018 nearly 60% of individuals offered an online medical record had viewed it at least once (healthdatamanagement.com).

In dollar terms this category is minimal since providers often do not charge when a patient requests their medical record and those that do charge a de minimis amount.

## Government Disability Programs: Not Monetizable

Federal and state government agencies—including the Social Security Administration (SSA), Veterans Affairs (VA), and state disability determination services (DDS) are major initiators of medical record requests. These agencies require patient records to evaluate claims for disability benefits, determine eligibility, and support appeals or ongoing reviews.

Government-driven requests are highly standardized, often routed through dedicated systems (e.g., SSA's Electronic Records Express) or handled by vendors with contracts to support disability adjudication. While high in volume, this segment is not monetizable for record custodians or retrieval companies unless they have secured government contracts. That said, vendors who support SSA or VA workflows often operate under large-scale, multi-year contracts with fixed rates, which can make the category attractive from a volume and stability standpoint—even if margins are thin.

## Economics of a Record Request

A record request is defined as the retrieval of a patient's medical record from a single medical facility. For example, if a patient has received care at both Mayo Clinic and Dana-Farber, this would count as two separate medical record requests—one per facility. Each time a medical record is retrieved, there are two distinct fees that are incurred:

### Service Fee:

These are the operational costs incurred by for the labor and time of retrieving the medical record; its covers:

*   Preparing documentation (e.g., HIPAA authorization)
*   Submitting requests (fax, portal, or mail)
*   Following up with providers
*   Confirming receipt and completeness of the records
*   Post-processing (e.g., indexing, OCR, redaction)
*   Final delivery to the customer

These fees are usually around $25 to $50 per medical record request and are not limited.

### Site Fees:

These are the charges imposed by the custodian of the medical records such as the hospital, clinic, EHR, or release of information vendor. These fees are often regulated by federal and state laws and vary based on request type as in the section above.

    *   *(Diagrammatic Representation: More Requestors → More Record Volume → More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume)*

Each additional User (whether a Requestor or Partner) adds value to the platform for all other users, creating a network effect that can accelerate growth and adoption. By focusing on building a comprehensive network, Hermes Health can create a powerful, self-sustaining cycle of growth and value creation for all stakeholders.

## Secular Industry Trends and Growth Outlook

### Rising Demand from Legal and Insurance Sectors

The volume of record requests is growing in parallel with legal claim volumes and insurance data needs. As one analysis notes, the record retrieval market “is expected to grow alongside growth in the volume of legal claims,” with particular increases in areas like auto injury torts and pharmaceutical litigation stax.com.

On the insurance side, health plans are increasingly data-driven – more audits, risk adjustments, and quality checks mean more charts requested each year. Payer record requests have spiked (30%+ increases in some areas) and are expected to continue climbing as value-based care initiatives expand mrocorp.com. In short, both the legal and insurance categories are experiencing secular growth, which fuels the overall market expansion.

## Regulatory Environment

Regulations like the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking rule (which took effect in 2021) aim to make data more accessible, potentially reducing friction in the long term for certain types of requests. Overall, a more open data environment is gradually emerging – which is good for requestors and patients, but means retrieval services must continue adding value (through efficiency and value-add services) beyond just pulling records.

## Technology and Service Expansion

To stay competitive, many firms are broadening their services. Some offer not just raw records but also summarization, indexing, or analysis of medical records for clients (e.g. creating medical chronologies for legal cases, or coding charts for risk adjustment after retrieval). There's also interest in blockchain and advanced security for record exchange, as mentioned in at least one analysis as a future opportunity (insightaceanalytic.com). Additionally, the largest vendors are positioning themselves as end-to-end “medical information exchange” companies, rather than just retrieval services, to align with healthcare's shift to interoperability.

The integration with provider workflows and claims systems is a trend e.g. delivering records directly into an insurance carrier's claim system or into a law firm's case management software to save client time (uslegalsupport.com). The market is also seeing new automated platforms that directly connect requestors to provider health systems (examples include some HIE networks or vendor networks like Epic's Care Everywhere, which bypass manual requests for participating providers). So far, these haven't fully displaced third-party retrieval services, especially for complex multi-source requests (stax.com), but they are part of the future landscape.
