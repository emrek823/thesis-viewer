### Team Background & Formation

- Chris and Betty volunteered together for pro-bono consulting in Chinatown post-COVID
- Chris: Former Vanta employee with compliance expertise; led first AI initiative at Medallion for automating credentialing
- Chris quit his job without having a specific idea - conviction came from finding the right co-founder
- Spent 10 months exploring different healthcare ideas (including infusions for patient access)
- Both have extensive provider-side experience through Capable Health and Medallion’s enterprise implementations (VillageMD, Oak Street)

### Market Opportunity & Vision

- Building $160B opportunity reimagining patient-provider connections
- Scheduling as initial wedge into broader marketplace
- Core thesis components:
	- Own provider’s phone (88% of patients still call in)
	- Own provider’s schedule through AI automation
	- Build provider density in specific geo/specialty
- Not trying to solve human behavior issues
- Problem: Patients lack single easy way to find/book/manage provider appointments
