### Fundraising Strategy & Timing

- Zócalo at growth inflection point - key implementations and growing team but facing resource constraints
- Cash balance discrepancy: $3M on paper vs “little bit over $1M” in bank account
	- RCM (Revenue Cycle Management) payment delays causing cash flow issues
	- Anthem (second biggest client) went live in April, payments finally starting this month
	- Santa Clara Health Plan similar situation - went live October, didn’t get payments until June
- New health plans require significant upfront investment before revenue materializes
	- HealthNet just kicked off, generating revenue through outreach
	- Inland Empire Health Plan also going live
	- Two dual eligible contracts starting January
- Hiring needs: ~10 physicians day one for meaningful opportunities early next year

### Investor Feedback & Market Position

- Cuesta Capital meeting 3 weeks ago: “top decile company in terms of performance”
	- Feedback: wait for one of the big opportunities to materialize before Series A process
- Market perception shift: Medicaid uncertainty vs complete doom 6 months ago
- Vamos willing to invest now rather than later
	- X mentioned $2-3M range but no uncapped note due to Medicaid uncertainty
	- Valuation discussion TBD
- Other committed investors identified:
	- $1-1.5M from Animo (existing)
	- Davita would participate
	- HealthWorx interested
	- Emily at Zeal reached out offering capital

### Capital Requirements & Use of Funds

- Target raise: $4-7M total, ideally $6M structured as:
	- $2M buffer for cash flow management between contract implementation and payment cycles
	- $2M for middle management layer - team getting too big for “everyone does everything” model
	- $2M for internal tech investments to reduce operational costs
		- Currently touching every claim manually (tens of thousands per month)
		- Automation could significantly reduce human touch points
- Moving to Candid Health for 95%+ touchless claims processing (2 months away)
- Strategy: secure funding now to avoid slowing business growth when health plans want faster execution
