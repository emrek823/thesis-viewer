### Company Overview

- Dataset of what good movement looks like - foundation model for humanoids and humans
- $375k revenue across D2C and B2B
- Underfoot sensors with 128 pressure sensors, IMU, barometer capturing 15-20 biometric data points
	- Pronation data, center pressure, loading rate
	- Real-time AI coaching feedback in runners’ ears
- Tesla came inbound, bought out inventory to scale training data for humanoids
	- Also in talks with DeepMind and Figure
- Revenue model: upfront hardware + recurring SaaS for movement model access

### Market Strategy & Flywheel

- Consumer product motivates purchases, generates movement data
- Humanoid companies pay premium rates for training data
- Higher B2B rates subsidize consumer product expansion
- Target markets beyond runners:
- Users already buying for elderly parents - daily walking monitoring

### Technical Challenges & Priorities

- Hardware increasingly ready (users running 100km+ consistently)
- Main challenge: software algorithm to process millions of steps data
	- Providing actionable insights from load/balance data
	- Handling massive data scale effectively
- Primary 12-month goal: repeatable model to get on every humanoid platform
- Secondary focus: demonstrating clear value through software and algorithms
