*Funding will further scale the company’s multimodal ML platform for patient selection*

SAN FRANCISCO--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com))--[Valinor](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.valinordiscovery.com%2F&esheet=54374398&newsitemid=20251211090416&lan=en-US&anchor=Valinor&index=1&md5=0d4c845ce8c3ee48e3ba36c82b244e89), a pioneering AI company leveraging advanced machine learning models to increase the probability of clinical trial success by deeply understanding patient response, today announced $13 million in funding. The seed funding was led by CRV, Harpoon Ventures, Amino Collective, and Pelion Venture Partners. Other participants include numerous leading angel investors and operators such as Charlie Songhurst, Surya Midha (co-founder of Mercor), Axel Ericsson, and Kyle Harrison.

“Our models are built to surface meaningful features that underlie patient response. We believe this approach will empower our pharmaceutical partners to improve clinical trial success rates, cut R&D costs and, most importantly, speed the delivery of life-saving medicines to patients,” said [Joshua Pacini](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjoshua-pacini-0548351aa%2F&esheet=54374398&newsitemid=20251211090416&lan=en-US&anchor=Joshua+Pacini&index=2&md5=bd4fc5c82f4c94adaf961d8d8f096440), Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Valinor. “With this funding, we are accelerating the expansion of our proprietary matched omics and clinical outcome datasets and advancing our AI models that allow our pharma partners to make smarter, data-driven decisions in drug development.”

Valinor’s models are trained on matched datasets of patient-derived multi-omic samples and treatment outcomes. The proprietary platform powers the first multimodal machine learning models trained to predict patient response across disease indications to rapidly identify patients more likely to respond favorably to a new drug. Utilizing Valinor’s platform, drug developers can distinguish responders from non-responders while surfacing novel biology associated with response that can reframe target patient populations, and uncover potential new indications based on real-world patient data.

“As early backers of tech bio pioneers like Recursion, we’ve seen AI become the driving force accelerating the next generation of drug development. Valinor pushes the frontier further with an AI-first, disease-focused platform training on exceptional clinical data. We believe this approach can meaningfully improve clinical trial success,” said Brittany Walker, General Partner at CRV.

With this financing, Valinor will further expand its proprietary datasets and recruit additional top-tier machine learning talent to expand the company’s San Francisco-based team.
