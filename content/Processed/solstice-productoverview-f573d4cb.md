# SOLSTICE PRODUCT OVERVIEW

## Solstice Patient Clinical Summary Reports
("Solstice generates curated patient summary reports by querying its networks of 750K+ providers, 120K+ care sites, and 220M+ patients across 50 states, consolidating patient data, and assembling relevant clinical information (i.e., progress notes, treatment history, labs, pathology reports, radiology reports) into a readable format for primary and specialty care teams. Solstice's proprietary algorithms parse through the retrieved information to identify what is relevant for a clinician to view. This information is structured into a report that is uploaded to the dashboard for a provider or admin staff member to review.")

## Solstice User Dashboard
("The user dashboard allows physician care teams to efficiently request and access patient clinical summary reports. Users can quickly generate new clinical summary reports, filter previous patient request, download new reports, and request additional information on specific patients.")

## Solstice Auto-Populate Tool
("The auto-populate tool allows physician care teams to upload externally generated spreadsheets containing patient demographics information and patient upcoming appointment details to automatically generate reports for the patients indicated in the spreadsheet onto the Solstice User Dashboard.")
