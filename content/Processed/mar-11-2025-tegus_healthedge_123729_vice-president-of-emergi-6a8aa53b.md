Legacy Systems, Data Governance, Professional Services, Next-Gen Solutions, AI, Provider Contracts, Market Segmentation, Customer base

### Summary
The conversation between the Tegus Client and the expert focused on the challenges and complexities of migrating core systems in the health insurance industry, particularly discussing HealthEdge and its competitors. The expert highlighted HealthEdge's strengths in the market, such as its scalability for mid-sized health plans and its user-friendly interface, contrasting it with the challenges of convincing larger health plans to switch due to costs and internal considerations. They also touched on the slow progress towards modern solutions in the industry and the potential impact of payer consolidation on HealthEdge's user base.

### Expert Details
VP Partnerships, Mergers, and Acquisitions at UnitedHealth Group Incorporated. The expert can speak in-depth to having explored HealthEdge as an option to replace TriZetto, other players in the space, etc.
Availability: All Times Eastern -- 3/3 [10a-1p], 3/4 -8-9a, 5-6p, 3/5 - 8-11a

The expert is the Vice President of Emerging Products at Lyric. The expert is responsible for overseeing product strategy and development, market surveillance, and emerging product/concept design, etc.

Prior to Lyric, the expert was the VP of Partnerships, Mergers, and Acquisitions at Optum. The expert was responsible for software-related inorganic growth activities, etc.

Prior to Optum, the expert was the Sr. Director of Enterprise Strategy and Communications in Anthem Digital/Claim Accuracy Products at Anthem, Inc., responsible for leading the sourcing for claim processing and payment accuracy, product development and strategy, running massive RFP's, as well as overseeing product roadmaps, negotiating strategic partnerships with external parties to move payment accuracy forward across the US.

Q: Q. Do you have experience using HealthEdge? Were you involved in the decision to select is as the vendor for your group?

A: I explored use of Health Rules Payer and the Source (Burgess) product as a potential replacement for both home-grown and TriZetto Products.

Q: Q. Who else have you used or who else did you compare HealthEdge to when selecting it?

A: Health Edge Source (Burgess) is comparable to Lyric (Former Change Healthcare) or Optum. Zelis, Rialtic, and Cotiviti have products that marginally overlap. On the Health Rules Payor Side, Trizetto (Cognizant) would be the biggest competitor. NASCO is waning in the space.

Q: Q. Can you speak in detail about pros and cons of HealthEdge vs. competing vendors (TriZetto) or homegrowgn systems?

A: Ultimately, displacement of an incumbent is full of risk and expense, meaning putting together a compelling business case is the biggest challenge for Top-20 Payors.

Q: Q. What is your title and role within your organization?

A: Currently, I am VP of Emerging Products at Lyric. I previously held roles as VP of Partnerships at Optum/CHC, and Senior Sourcing Director at Elevance

Q: Q.How long have you been in the industry? Describe your organization briefly - how big is it in terms of members or revenue?

A: I have been in the industry for a decade plus -- I currently work for the largest claims editor in the industry, but previously led sourcing of this category for a top-2 Payer.

**Client**
Thanks for doing this. I've got a bit about your background, but the purpose of the call today is payer software landscape with a focus on HealthEdge and its competitors. My understanding is you were both a customer at United and are now a competitor at Lyric, but maybe just level set with your background as it pertains to the product and the category.

**Expert**
My background is managing market intelligence, partnerships, strategic acquisitions, and investment. I work for Lyric currently which focuses on payment integrity and payment accuracy spaces. Prior to this, I had a similar role with Optum and then with Change Healthcare, and then preceding that, I was lead for sourcing for payment integrity, claims editing with Elevance, which previously was Anthem. I've sat on both sides of this, both as a buyer and as a seller of these services.

**Client**
Great. Maybe we could just start with your high-level assessment of CAPS, just the relative strengths and weaknesses and market position of HealthEdge versus a TriZetto or SS&C or NASCO or homegrown systems. Just your assessment of strengths and weaknesses and the way in which the market's trending.

**Expert**
Having been in the space, I've obviously crossed multiple different claim platforms. HealthEdge, like you mentioned, TriZetto, a lot of homegrown stuff. You've got NASCO which is still hanging out there, which, in all honesty, it's a declining business in its space. Where I see strong strength with HealthEdge as compared to TriZetto. In my mind, outside of homebrew systems that are still hanging out with the large legacy carriers, those are really the two choices left in the industry right now of any size.

HealthEdge really coming at it from the hosted market and the integrated space with their connection through to HealthEdge Source, and then their partnerships out to Zelis for payments. It really provides a full ecosystem of claim management into HealthEdge Source which gets you your Medicare pricing and other custom pricing if you wanted to do that, and then into payment management via their partnerships with Zelis. It seems to be a much more scalable platform, especially for a mid-sized health plan.

When I was at Elevance, we looked at it as a full takeout of the existing behavioral health management after the acquisition of Beacon. From a strength perspective, the technology was there, trying to get over IT governance and data governance with sourcing going back four or five years. They're probably ahead of their times and struggled a little bit with getting adoption among the larger health plans. Big detriment with them was, in all honesty, I'll call it the straight nickel and diming of professional services.

They didn't call it custom build. The configuration and customization, they really had the market on that with respect to being able to set rates and drive additional services revenue, which, for a top two health plan, looking for other options didn't go over particularly well. I think part of that was being, I'll use the word newer to the market, where TriZetto is a little bit more known. Cognizant has resources out there and a large alumni network where even if you're not happy with Cognizant as a whole, you have other places to go get the necessary expertise to complete your claims work.

One thing Cognizant had that I think was significantly better, for lack of a better term, is their pricing capabilities went far beyond the best-in-class that HealthEdge has around Medicare and were able to handle more complex claim pricing scenarios. Cognizant was significantly harder to integrate with. From the way of seat today and the Change Healthcare seat and the Optum seat, we saw that frequently where your health plans were still heavily dependent on using Cognizant resources to get a custom integration for anything that wanted to look even approximate to real-time or near real-time.

**Client**
Can we double-click on a bunch of things that you said? You mentioned it was just much more scalable for mid-sized plan and then you said that they were ahead of their time with something. Can you expand on that?

**Expert**
Going back to my earlier direct dealings with HealthEdge, HealthEdge was one of the first ones in the market to suggest cloud-hosted solutions or multi-tenant hosted solutions. Today, that's looking like the right move, but at the time, the data governance barriers to that, a larger health plan saying, "We don't want our data leaving our four walls. We want to be on-prem still. We want control of our data. What about response time?" All the things that we're not concerned about today, five years ago, that was a major concern for a health plan and was a barrier to getting sales.

Mid-sized health plan called Blue Cross of Arizona, they didn't have the large IT infrastructure in the server rooms and all the other stuff that goes with it. To them, it was like, "Hey, we're already outsourcing this, so what's the difference if it's AWS or Azure or your own thing as opposed to where I'm currently shipping it?" The large health plans had massive reluctance to give control of their data centers.

**Client**
In your view, has that changed? Is this a foregone conclusion that the industry has realized that it has to migrate? What's driving that?

**Expert**
My view is the industry has realized they have to migrate to be cost-competitive. I really segment out when I talk about this space. You've got Anthem and United which do their own thing, and I understand it's Elevance. You've got the top two, and then you have three through seven, and then you get into everybody else. They start to fall out pretty quickly. The top seven, I think, still believe they have some version of pricing power or some amount of influence to where, "Yeah, we agree we have to go multi-tenant, but we want to do it on our space." Where the smaller plans are like, "Yeah, we have to go multi-tenant, and it's fine."

I think it's more semantics, and I'm seeing that firsthand with some of the Lyric projects. Empirically, I can say that that seems to hold up, that once you get outside the top seven health plans, they've accepted that you're either going to be an AWS shop or an Azure shop, or maybe a little bit of both, and it's just somebody else's cloud.

**Client**
Interesting. I've heard that, and at the same time, I've also heard that HealthEdge is really optimized for larger plans. Is that true? Is that difference larger, meaning eight through 20? Correct my impression if it's wrong.

**Expert**
I think HealthEdge, by construction, is optimized to work on larger plans. They've got the capability to scale and handle tens of millions of lives, but there's outside business influences and market motivations that make it hard to penetrate those top five, top eight spaces, even if you have the bigger product. Mostly, it's switching costs. United still has homegrown claim systems. Elevance, even though they're a Facets shop for one line of business, they still have a homegrown system on the other side. Centene has homegrown systems, HCSC.

All the big ones still have these large homebrew systems. There's a takeout cost that goes with it that isn't just, "I'm switching from TriZetto to HealthEdge. Great. It's one vendor to another and there are some costs." When you're turning off your own mainframes and things like that, there are other considerations that obviously go into it of large internal staffs that can be eliminated. On one hand, it reduces cost, but on the other hand, it can create tensions in the cities and the markets that they operate in.

**Client**
Meaning can create tensions with government lines of business because they're linked?

**Expert**
Elevance based in Indianapolis, I forget what the last census of people in the state, you get into releasing hundreds or thousands of people from their jobs and that's not going to go over well with contracts that you have holding state health plans and things like that.

**Client**
Got it. This is going to be a question I would ask later in the conversation, but since we're going down this path, how would you describe the degree to which that migration to next-gen solutions, for lack of a better term, the extent to which it is or is not accelerating? My impression is that it's what you described, which is that this migration of a CAP system is such a cumbersome undertaking and so fraught with risk that the bigger the plan is, the harder it is to convince them to move.

Also that most other software-intensive businesses have moved to the cloud. Potentially, AI is more applicable if you're in the cloud. I'm just wondering, are those united? Maybe this question needs to be segmented between the top seven and everyone else. Are these migrations or these opportunities to win customers that were previously unwinnable, are they accelerating and to what extent?

**Expert**
Qualitatively, from the claim editing, payment accuracy side, we've seen more activity in the market among the top five or seven and more willingness to make changes in the last two years than I've seen in the previous eight before that. I feel like the benefits of making that transition, before you knew it was there and there was going to be some money and it was a chance to, I hate to call it innovate, but there is a chance to innovate and get ahead of the curve. I think what is left is now in order to remain competitive, this is something you have to choose to do.

As you are getting things like AI, machine learning, advanced analytics on the back end, the benefits of moving continue to get bigger. Building out server farms is not the thing to do anymore. It's to let somebody else manage something that is scalable. I think on one hand, you are seeing that, but on the other hand, if you just pull out of the market, the last I think three, four days, Blue of Michigan lost $1 billion, Rhode Island lost $115 million. There are a few others that are posting some really big losses.

**Client**
You had mentioned that in your work today, you're seeing some acceleration in that migration activity, even among the top seven. You were then starting to caveat that or double-click on it.

**Expert**
We're seeing a willingness to entertain discussions to make moves. We're seeing that motion. The big challenge that we see, and I've seen in the space for multiple views, is that any migration is a multi-year

project and that means that health plans, in a time of stemming losses and after admin cost pressures, have to find a way to budget increased expenses over a short or multi-year period of time to get long-term savings over the next decade.

As much as you could capitalize expenses and do some accounting treatments to smooth that out, the expenses are not trivial to move. In illustration of that, I'm giving you a primary claims editor because core claims processing, pricing goes all over the place. If you're a two million-five million life primary claim editor, you're probably paying $1.50-$3 per member per year for the service.

If you're going to do a cutover, you're probably going to go through a period of dual processing of, one, running in a benign state to make sure everything works. If someone size of Elevance, which I know is bigger than two million-five million lives, that's a six-month piece. At minimum, you have six months of dual licensing.

The cost to move an editing component, let alone the entire core, you're talking eligibility, provider integrations, all those things, the cost to move an editor is equal to or greater than two years of fees. You've got to find a way to absorb that cost to go get some savings on the back end. It's really hard to make that case, especially in the day and age of everybody wants projects that are in-year beneficial.

That's where I think you need a market force of a true new capability on the back end that's like, "Look at all the things we can say in a committed leadership," and you almost need to be PO'd at the thing you currently have. I don't have a polite way to say it, but you have to be angry enough, "I know it's going to be painful, but I'm going to do it anyway."

**Client**
In your view, that new capability, does that exist today? My sense is this industry, from a software perspective, is much more on-prem and legacy-heavy than most.

**Expert**
I match review of that. It is very legacy-heavy. I think so much of it has to do especially in the payer space. Think about core claims administration. You have eligibility files, they update regularly. How many clients do you have? How many administrative services only or group plans do you have that are providing eligibility to you on a regular basis that you have to manage? You have all your medical policies and payment policies that need to be configured.

In all honesty, the size of the health plan, regardless of the health plan, the number and scope of payment and medical policies are fairly similar whether you're a five million life plan or whether you're a 20 million life plan or one million life plan. Provider contracts scale a little bit differently. A small health plan, a couple hundred thousand lives is probably in a concentrated provider network. They may be in the hundreds or low thousands of provider contracts, but a plan approaching the size of an Elevance is in the high tens to low hundreds of thousands of contracts.

There's just so much configuration and stuff that needs to be moved and so much technical debt that gets patched over time that moving the core system isn't just about swapping out. Elevance calls their system WGS. It's not just swap WGS for Elevance. It's like, "Now I have to go repair all this technical debt at the same time." I went through the project to move a claims pricer and that was a three to five-year project.

**Client**
This would be like a Burgess Source.

**Expert**
Yeah. I want to put Burgess Source in for pricing, I need to move provider contracts, we need three to five years to do it. The rationale on that, real quick, is you'd want to start with a new contract template so that you have something clean to efficiently move all the contracts and the configurations. It's like, "I need a clean contract template and then I need to go through the natural cycle of renegotiating with every one of my providers to get them into that template so that I can load it so that I can move."

**Client**
You couldn't have the software incorporate the existing contract structures. You would have to wait for them to all just expire.

**Expert**
You could do it. I was part of the team doing the analysis and it was like, "We're going to spend so much money." Surgeons doing specialty stuff, some of their pricing is calculated by hand. It's like, "If I'm moving this, I'm doing it to get rid of this by hand calculation. Well, that means I actually have to spend the money to go code it," or other exceptions and things like that. I'm not saying you can't do it without doing it, but you're going to spend even more money.

**Client**
That's on one element of the Burgess Source product?

**Expert**
Exactly. You have medical policies and then you have payment policies. You have YOUR credentialing information to make sure that the right specialists are doing work within the network. It's a really, really big undertaking. I admire the plans that have done it. That also makes the value of a win so much more.

**Client**
Yeah. Is there anything changing in the industry? I mentioned AI. Is this just a slow but inevitable burn, or are we going to wake up in 10 years and 50% of the installations are still going to be the legacy systems that you're describing?

**Expert**
I think it's going to be somewhere between the two. I think AI is going to make the ingestion and characterization of these medical policies and payment policies and even provider contracts to some extent. It's going to lower that change burden, but there's still a massive configuration and testing project that has to happen.

If I look at my customer base qualitatively of when I joined Change Healthcare, I was through the cycles of I came in as it was Change, it was bought by Optum, it was spun out. When I came in, which would have been 2021, we were probably 75% or more on-prem. We're now close to being half hosted with a pathway to, by customer base, make most of our clients multi-tenant within two years. I'm seeing the speed tick up.

**Client**
That's a ton of progress.

**Expert**
It is. Qualitatively, from my view, I can probably circle the five or six health plans that are big from a number of customers versus number of lives. I bet three years from now, it might be 80% of the customers have moved, but we're still going to have a disproportionate percentage of the lives in an on-prem situation. This goes back to your market segmentation standpoint. You have a small health plan, you can basically dictate to them of "I'm no longer supporting on-prem," and they have no choice but to move. You try to go tell Elevance that and they'll tell you to pound sand. They'll find somebody who will meet them exactly where they are right now.

**Client**
Can you just double-click into the point you made about HealthEdge's implementation or professional services being really expensive?

**Expert**
At the time they had a deal with UST that provided a lot of the, I call it BPO, the business process and the

migration. I won't call it captive or single source, but HealthEdge did a really good job of keeping their developers and their people with familiarity in the family. There wasn't a developed skill set from an Accenture or an independent place to assist with a move.

You had to use HealthEdge resources or UST or you were going to struggle to find the expertise you needed to make the move. I think that's lessened over time. Their contracting approach really was, "Come in with a good price and a clear scope," but took price the hell out of any scope change.

**Client**
A bait and switch.

**Expert**
I hate to call it bait and switch, but yeah. I'm going to give you an eye-poppingly low number that we know we're going to grow over time. It reminds me of my days in defense contracting. Bid minimum compliance and then charge extra for the ashtrays.

**Client**
Can you give me a sense for, maybe within CAPS, what's your sense of how the market is segmented today? Maybe in terms of lives or dollars between say homegrown legacy on-prem and then next-gen, let's say, what HealthEdge is offering?

**Expert**
All right. Next-gen, if we pretend it's about 330 million total lives, get you pretty close. Elevance, Optum, HCSC, Molina, Centene, you're probably between the N Humana, those segments that I'm aware of that are on-prem and Cigna, you're north of 120 million lives that are on-prem. Something homebrew, not using the space.

If I think through a customer list carefully and aggregate HealthEdge of the remainder of that set, I probably run into three Facets customers for every one HealthEdge customer, and then probably double that to get to a NASCO customer. Meaning I have less than half as many HealthEdge customers as I do NASCO customers.

**Client**
You're saying NASCO is roughly half the size of HealthEdge?

**Expert**
I would say it's half or less.

**Client**
Got it. SS&C?

**Expert**
SS&C is less than a handful of customers.

**Client**
Got it. If it's Facets to HealthEdge to NASCO is like six to two to one. What's your sense of how that pie is shifting? Is it that TriZetto and HealthEdge are slowly eating away at the rest? Is the share between TriZetto and HealthEdge also somewhat changing?

**Expert**
I'm hearing of some TriZetto to HealthEdge conversions. Not many, but some. I'm hearing on-prem to another commercial solution. Definitely hearing more chatter of going to HealthEdge. I've run into at least two new HealthEdge customers in the last six months.

**Client**
You're saying that on-prem, that's from homegrown solutions?

**Expert**
Yeah. From homegrown to giving up and moving on. At least two new HealthEdge customers, and I can't name a single TriZetto that I've heard is, "Hey, we're getting TriZetto from our customers."

**Client**
You're saying you're not seeing TriZetto conversions to HealthEdge or you're not seeing homegrown conversions to TriZetto?

**Expert**
Both. I'm not hearing anything of homegrown to TriZetto and I'm not hearing anyone dropping HealthEdge for TriZetto. In this space, I think HealthEdge is the one, in all honesty, with the best growth trajectory. I'm not saying it's fast or exponential growth, but they've clearly figured out the product and are doing the right things to get the sales. It's just it is a hard sales cycle.

**Client**
To a non-engineer, what is clearly better about their product?

**Expert**
The degree of data integration that they have in that when you configure, loading eligibility is very straightforward. Loading provider networks is very straightforward. To a non-engineer, think of it as HealthEdge is like using a Mac or a Chromebook, where the apps just work, almost like being on, I would say, an iPad. You install the app and it works. TriZetto is more like Windows 95 where you still have to do an install, then you have to do a configuration, and then you have to go link files. You need a lot more formal training to work inside TriZetto than you do within HealthEdge.

**Client**
That's not from an implementation standpoint, that's from everyday user.

**Expert**
From a straight user standpoint. You can pull somebody from a construction project management background, and I'm saying this because I've done it, and you can set them in front of HealthEdge and they will become productive in it. I'm not saying school doesn't help and things like that, but if you want somebody to operate a Facets TriZetto-based system, they've got to have at least some basic understanding of coding and technology to become a good user.

**Client**
It sounds like what you're describing is to the extent that payers are consolidating, that's a headwind to HealthEdge. The bigger players are not the users. It's the smaller players that are theoretically being acquired.

**Expert**
I think that is the case. If you see a merger of two equals, then that becomes an opportunity of "Hey, we have to agree on something. Maybe everybody moves."

**Client**
Great. Well, thanks for your time and insight. Have a wonderful rest of your day.
