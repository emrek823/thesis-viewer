### Outsiders Fund Background & Investment Thesis

- Fund focuses on seed/Series A with $2-8M checks
- Targets idiosyncratic opportunities outside mainstream venture attention
- Thesis derived from co-founder’s experience scaling data backup/recovery company to multibillion outcome in niche market
- Teddy: Former quant engineer at Bridgewater (FX team), ML startup experience, MBA, brief stint at General Catalyst
- Lindsay: Joined July, 4 years at JP Morgan (corporate strategy, tech investment banking covering semiconductors to enterprise software), launched biotech accelerator program

### Hermes Business Model & Market Position

- Leverages ROI vendors as custodians to bear security/compliance risk for sensitive patient data
- Switzerland positioning as neutral middleware vs direct competition with health systems
- Revenue model uses different fee structure with ROI vendors than traditional approaches
- Building white-labeled portals for client stickiness
- Target markets: Legal (current focus), life sciences, healthcare analytics, direct consumer
- 18-24 month head start on competition due to founder’s domain expertise

### Technical Architecture & Network Density

- Current differentiation primarily network-based, not technical innovation
- Claims data: No concerns (7 big payers, few major clearinghouses)
- Provider data: Established through existing relationships
- Medical records: Work remaining for direct EHR connections
- Imaging: Strategic priority for competitive moat
- Network density timeline: Summer 2025 target for sufficient coverage

### Competitive Landscape & Strategic Risks

- No direct competitors identified despite 2+ years of market research
- Risk: Large players like Convex, Magna could add technical capabilities to existing networks
- Hermes advantages: API-first approach, comprehensive data vs multiple vendor fragmentation
- Long-term risk: ROI vendors may demand higher pricing or restrict access
- Mitigation: Drive volume in near-term, position as essential partner for API transition

### Future Positioning Decisions

- Current phase: Build network density
- Next phase: Data normalization and transformation (non-commoditized challenge)
- Strategic inflection: When to move beyond Switzerland positioning into analytics/storage
- Hiring priority: CTO with strategic market positioning understanding
- Capital efficiency: $4M sufficient to reach key decision points vs Datavant’s over-dilutive approach
