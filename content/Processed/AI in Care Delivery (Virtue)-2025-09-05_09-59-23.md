### Venture Market Dynamics & Deal Flow

- Both funds experiencing strong deal flow after slow H1
	- Virtue activated $55M Fund II in March, completed 4 deals since
	- Most deals now off-market vs formal processes
	- Top 20% founders moving too quickly for traditional 2-3 month relationship building
	- Some funds offering $1M notes at $15M caps immediately upon founders leaving jobs
- PE process challenges
	- Everything becomes formal process, goal is avoiding them
	- Benchmark Capital struggles with new world order, people quitting fund
- Strategic evolution needs
	- Go-to-market and recruiting support require beefing up
	- Every portfolio company hiring founding engineers
	- Need heavy hitters for deal winning and post-investment support

### AI-Driven Healthcare Margin Analysis

- Provider economics modeling shows significant EBITDA improvement potential
	- Target: 2000+ basis points improvement across care delivery lifecycle
	- Intake optimization, clinical efficiency, administrative automation
	- Less bullish on ambient scribes (physician satisfaction vs PNL impact)
- Shore Capital connections valuable
	- Hired Tom Antony (product) + 2 engineers as “AI Aces”
	- Running similar analysis across healthcare roll-ups
	- Josh Kushner’s accounting roll-up achieved 750 basis point EBITDA improvement
- Implementation challenges
	- Need agentic vs copilot approaches for maximum impact
	- EMR systems creating friction, resembling cyber attacks
	- Mandolin operating without EMR approval, annoying vendors

### Build-Then-Buy Healthcare Strategy

- Autism services business model (5 clinics in Massachusetts)
	- Building AI tooling internally vs buying commodity solutions
	- Treatment plan generation focus (autism-specific)
	- Clinic cash flow: 5-6 month payback, 6 patients minimum
- Acquisition targets and returns
	- Sub-$50M enterprise value deals
	- Example: $20M revenue, $3M EBITDA target
	- Projected IRRs compelling if margin improvements validate
- Market gaps identified
	- Zero-to-one venture to middle market PE gap
	- Abundance of capital in $75-500M range seeking assets
	- Opportunity to create $150M+ assets from $15M investments

### Next Steps

- Nimish to intro Tom Antony at Shore Capital for provider economics collaboration
- Nimish to connect with Eden Klein (CTO at Imagine Pediatrics) for engineering insights
- Continue monthly catch-ups on market developments
