### Health system use cases and contracting approach

- Look back analysis use cases - top few use cases identified:
	- 3 strong core use cases: Malnutrition, heart failure readmission risk, hospital-at-home eligibility
	- Secondary use cases: Surgical opportunities and incidental findings
	- Last use case quite custom - no standard approach yet
- Baseline model strategy:
	- Can start with baseline model to show initial value
	- Should get 80% of the way there in terms of demonstrating ROI
	- Hard part will be the contracting process
- Contingency-based contracting model exploration:
	- Hospital leaders, especially CFOs, prefer this over SaaS model
	- Flow with customers is more custom than traditional SaaS
	- Billing varies significantly (malnutrition detection vs CDI/billing approaches)
	- Strategy: Use look-back analysis estimates to create contracts
		- Example: Extract 12 months of data, find $8M in net new revenue potential
		- Contract for minimum $6M with 15% fee structure
		- Built-in adjustment mechanisms if performance varies

### Current pipeline and end-of-year targets

- 3 potential health system customers for end of year:
	- Advent Health - deepest relationship, most conversations and people engaged, biggest opportunity but carries most risk
	- Albany Med - deeper relationship, more recent activation after closing other business
	- ECU Health - most recent and early conversation but very close to right people, strong interest
- Mayo Clinic - icing on the cake for brand value but less direct revenue
	- Would convert later due to strict procurement process
	- Good for press releases and validation evidence
- End-of-year goal: 2-3 customers maximum
	- Focus on quality over quantity for referenceable customers
	- Pushing past 3 could compromise execution and references

### Go-to-market strategy and hiring priorities

- Resource allocation philosophy:
	- Not a people problem - bringing more people without context wastes time
	- Strategy: Be extremely persistent with targeted prospects, go deep with early wins
	- Use successful studies to create massive sales motion afterward
- Commercial hire identified as immediate need:
	- Originally planned for early next year, now considering accelerating
	- Need someone to support pipeline building while core team focuses on current customers
	- Recruiting is new muscle for the team - seeking guidance on profile and sourcing
- Platform requirements for scaling:
	- Mostly working with existing capabilities
	- Mayo data helps with testing and iteration
	- Not requiring major new product development

### Engineering candidates and next steps

- 3 final engineering candidates identified:
	- Cynthia - MIT 2020 grad, strong ML/AI background, experience at 3rd Risk working with Mayo Clinic, concern about research orientation vs deployment focus
	- Andrew - More senior, Lockheed and Palantir background, electrical/embedded experience, less ML experience but fast learner
	- Naran - Favorite candidate, junior enough to mold, strong customer work experience, creative with sales skills, hates research and wants to deploy, nearly through interview process
- Action items requested by investors:
	- Implement structured agenda for 3-week call cadence
	- Create manifesto-style strategy document covering 12-18 month roadmap from current state to $10M revenue target
	- Should address how today’s decisions build momentum vs create bottlenecks
	- Focus on tactical execution plan supporting strategic goals
- Conference strategy: Attending industry conferences in September as core learning and networking opportunity
