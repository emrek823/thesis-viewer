## Overview of Expert's Experience

**Expert**
I have about 24 years of experience in this space. Live and breathe the revenue cycle management. I currently serve as the head of RCM at my current company, and my net patient revenue or collection is in the low ten figures in total as of yesterday. I have many end markets. I have 15 inpatient acute hospitals. Nine of them are on Epic platform and six of them are on Oracle Cerner platform.

**Client**
Sorry, six are on what?

**Expert**
Six of them are Oracle. They acquired Cerner. I also have about 1,400 physicians in various medical groups. That side, we're using athenahealth as the EHR. We have ModMed as well there, smaller groups. I also have post-acute facilities, like long-term care hospitals, inpatient rehab hospitals, and then skilled nursing facility, SNFs. I use a bunch of platforms over there, EHR platform like PointClickCare, Matrix, and things like that. I have a lot of vendors that I use in the front end, the mid-cycle, the back end on AI and KPIs and stuff. We can go over those as the conversation progresses.

I grew up at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, 14 years there. I was both on the hospital side and physician side. I spent some time in Lakeland Regional Health System in Florida and then a company called Compass Pointe Healthcare, which is in the post-acute space. A very solid 24 years experience in this space.

## Spending on RCM Operations

**Client**
Got it. You mentioned low ten figures of collections. What is your spending on RCM operations, including labor and software and other fees?

**Expert**
That's a very big question. I would say that we try to keep it below 3% of collections. My goal is to get it down to like 2%, but we are slightly above 2%.

**Client**
Got it. How much of the spending is on labor versus software?

**Expert**
As I said, I have different end markets, so the measurements and the metrics are very different. If we keep this conversation just under 15 hospitals that I have, probably will give you more value today. The 15 hospitals that I have, there's a lot of stuff that goes on the front end. Think of yourself going into a hospital. There is financial screening, clinical screening, insurance verification, insurance discovery tools that we use with various vendors. We have Medicaid application. If somebody does not have coverage, we tried to get Medicaid and things like that or even to qualify for our charity program.

There's a lot that goes on there, registration, prior authorization, which is very important before the patient comes into the hospital. There's technology there. In the mid-cycle, we got to think about stuff like charge capture, accurate and timely clinical documentation. The clinical documentation has to be very good, and we have to make sure that we capture all of our services rendered. That's what gets fed into our coding engine. We use 3M here. 3M is our coding engine. A lot of the mid-cycle is automated. I will give you a percent in a minute.

In the back end, we have claims scrubbing and preparation and transmission to the payers through various clearinghouses, working rejections, and DDE rejections, posting payments, patient statements, and service centers for the call center, and then bad debt management. We have things like dashboarding and KPIs and stuff. On the front-end, about 60% of my operation in the hospital side is automated through technology, about 40% or so is still labor, where I have humans doing work. In the mid-cycle, we are about 70%.

## Conversation Transcript

**Client:**
Right. What did you say for the front office?

**Expert:**
The front office is about 60/40, 60% automated and 40% labor, we have humans. There are reasons for that. We're still going through the process of automating more, things like prior authorization, for instance. It's one of the top denials in revenue cycle management, prior auths. We're piloting and we have partnership with companies like Waystar, for instance, and Myndshft to really beef up. It's automate the whole prior authorization process. We're not there yet. We're still using a lot of faxing, going on a payer portal, calling, and things like that.

Registration also on the front end, especially through the ER and things like that, it's still labor-intensive there. We're trying to have more automation. We do have like true Epic. We have MyChart Epic where the patient can go in and see the next available appointments and things like that, update their insurance information, there's communication. Cerner as well has a module, we call it referral management CRM module that communicates with the patient about their out-of-pocket expense and things like that. Nevertheless, we do still have quite a bit of manual processes in the front-end.

**Client:**
Got it. These sort of automation levels seems like on average, from what you've told me, it's like 70%, 80% automated, the whole thing. Are these automation levels representative of the overall market or do you think the other healthcare providers in the U.S. are maybe more automated or perhaps less automated?

**Expert:**
That's a very big question. It depends on the hospital culture and their budgets and things like that and the size of the hospital and what EHR platform and stuff they're using. You have MEDITECH, you have Allscripts, Epic, Cerner, and things like that. It really depends on the hospital, how much they want to invest in technology and things like that. I'm a member of HFMA and MGMA and so many other RCM organizations. For the large health systems in the country, there are about 70% automated, 30% manual. It really depends on the organization, culture and leadership buy in, and processes and workflow and the EHR.

Now a lot of the EHR, the Epic of the world, they do have modules that can be used for a lot of these stuff. The problem is those modules are not good enough. There are gaps and hence revenue cycle leaders like myself will seek point solutions or both on technology to integrate with the EHR so that we can have better results. If you were to ask me, the number one RCM denial today is in the mid-cycle. A lot of Medicare and United of the world, they look for every single reason to deny a claim for lack of medical necessity, coding-related issues, claims are going to high dollar review, and things like that.

My 15 hospitals are over half of my total, and we have about $20+ million in clinical denials today. There are many other denials, you name it, prior authorization, eligibility, timely filing, many, many other denials. The number one, and this is representative in the U.S. where payers are just willy-nilly and sometimes inaccurately denying claims for medical necessity, even though prior auths and stuff are in place, a lot of concurrent reviews were done while the patient was in-house and things like that. A lot of technology investments, I will say, and tech stacks and where you're seeing a lot of point solution companies are focusing on is in the mid-cycle.

For instance, Waystar just acquired a company called Iodine. You probably saw that in the news. The reason for that Waystar is pretty much an end-to-end technology RCM provider. They have technology that can pretty much automate the entire cycle. One of the areas that they were lacking in is the mid-cycle. They did not really capitalize on that market. They have some modules in revenue integrity and things like that, but you have companies like AKASA, you have companies like SmarterDX, Thoughtful AI, you have companies like 3M, Optum, and Change Healthcare even, they're very good mid-cycle modules to improve revenue cycle performance.

**Expert Discussion on Waystar Technology Usage**

**Client:**
What exactly are you using Waystar for at your organization today? Are you using them end-to-end or are you only using a specific module from Waystar?

**Expert:**
For the large part, Waystar is our primary technology partner. We use about maybe 60% of their technology. On the front-end, we use their eligibility, we use their insurance discovery, we use their point of service estimates, how much a patient will override based on their benefits, and what they're coming in for. We use them for prior authorization, but that still is in a piloting phase.

Waystar has a partnership with a company called Recondo. You probably look them up. The prior authorization module that our technology that Waystar is using, it's not theirs, it's a third-party company, and it's not going too well, to be honest with you. There's a lot of issues with the implementation, but we're working them through. That's how we're using them on the front-end.

Now in the mid-cycle, we are now piloting with them since they acquired Iodine. We just started a pilot with them to do charge scrubbing for us prior to coding. Prior to the documentation getting closed out, fed into our 3M coding engine, we have Iodine, which is Waystar now, doing our charge scrubbing to ensure that the clinicians and physicians are documenting and giving their recommendations and guidelines and things like that, how to document.

**Client:**
The workflows that you are using Iodine for now, who were you using before?

**Expert:**
3M.

**Client:**
Why did you decide to replace?

**Expert:**
Too expensive. We have issues with them as well. We have some inaccurate recommendations to clinicians which caused a lot of problems, and we had some dashboarding issues and stuff. 3M is very, very expensive.

**Client:**
Right. Is Iodine a much better product or slightly?

**Expert:**
I think so, yes. I think based on what we're seeing and how they are communicating and the project managers and stuff is working with our IT team and their project plan, it's going to be better than 3M and it's cheaper because as I said, Waystar is our number one technology partner, so we have bundling pricing advantages. We also use Waystar extensively in the back end for all of our claims editing, transmission, rejections management, denials management.

They have a direct connection with the Medicare system, the DDE system. My billers and collectors connect directly through Waystar and they're real time, live in the Medicare system to fix issues and work audits and things like that. Of course, they have automated ERA posting, the remits and things like that. We also use them for printed statements up to 120 days to satisfy our Medicare cost reports. After that, those patient balances are outsourced to different companies.

# Client-Expert Discussion on Automation in Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)

## Client
The biggest question I'm trying to answer through these calls is to really understand what is the level of automation in RCM today. We think over the very long term, like 10, 15 years out, super long-term, what is the headroom for these automation solutions, these automation providers to deepen their penetration? It seems like from what you've told me that Waystar is the one that's truly end-to-end today or the closest to being end-to-end, and that your organization and the U.S. in general is about 70% automated already. It seems like there's not a ton of headroom for further automation?

## Expert
I think there is autonomous coding. We're not truly autonomous. We still have 3M doing our coding and we have auditors and stuff. Coding auditors that does auditing and those coding. We are partnering with a different company to explore autonomous coding, a company called Gap. On the physician side, there's a company that we use called Nym for autonomous coding. It's going pretty well there, but we're not there yet. We are 80% accurate. I think on the acute side, we're not even there to be automated with autonomous coding. That's big room there for that.

## Client
An easier way for me to digest would be to think about an overall level of technology spend and where it could be if you were fully automated. If we extrapolate the capabilities of software five, 10 years out, they use more AI, there's more software, some more things can be automated. If your provider system was to incorporate all of this technology, what would that mean for your spending on companies like Waystar? Would it be like a 50% increase given the room you see for automation, or you think it could double or triple?

## Expert
We're about 70% today with Waystar automated. If they get into coding, coding is very expensive. Coding an inpatient chart can be $20 per chart through 3M. If you're manually coding a chart, a 1,200-page chart, that can be like $50 per chart or even $80 per chart. Coding is very expensive, where I see automation can really reduce costs and will give us a need to use more coding technology. I think that's a big part of the puzzle today for us. Maybe other health systems are way ahead in terms of exploring their autonomous coding.

If coding were to be fully automated with us, that will increase our spend by another maybe 15% with Waystar, for instance. Now you're talking about 15% manual stuff. I don't think it is possible to have a revenue cycle that's 100% automated. It's impossible. You don't have automation. The state Medicaid portal doesn't allow you to have an FTP connection with the state portal. That's still a manual process where staff has to enter financial information, household information, and things like that. That's a big part.

I'll tell you what's going to happen with the One Big Beautiful Bill in the U.S., the bill that just passed Congress here with Trump. We are estimating, we're projecting that a lot of people will lose their Medicaid coverage and the Medicaid requirement will be tightened up and a lot of people will lose their Obamacare and exchange plans. You are going to see a rise in self-pay type of patient, private pay patient, patient who cannot pay the bills, which will in turn really have provider and health systems beef up their Medicaid pending application to see what it can do.

My point is on the front-end, I think it's not possible to automate everything in the front-end. You will need some humans. The same thing goes for on the front-end like prior authorization, that's not 100% perfectly automated. There are still issues, like payer wants to do peer-to-peer review and things like that before approving a case. You still need involvement of clinicians and other personnel.

Even in the mid-cycle, today we have Optum doing some work for us in the mid-cycle auditing and things like that. I still think that you will need to maintain level of humans in all three phases of the cycle. Even in the back end, certain appeals and stuff will need to be perfectly curated, and there's going to have to be tough conversation with some of the payers and things like that.

A lot of my back end is automated, to be honest with you. It's just like the claims editing and stuff, we have humans looking at them. For the most part, when a chart is coded and completed, it falls into our billing queue. We have edits set up in Epic, for instance, and Waystar. If those edits are manually work, that's

where humans come in. Somebody has to manually see why you're using certain revenue code or accounts code and things like that or the ICD-10 is off and things like that. You're going to need to maintain a certain level of billers to look at these edits and things like that and work edits in the Medicare systems and things like that.

A good 85% of my central billing office is pretty automated. Claims goes out automatically once they're fixed. If you have ACH payments, EFT payments, they automatically goes into your bank account. The ERA, automatically once you're enrolled, they get posted into the system. If you have the API set up, the cash poster is like a small number of cash poster, just have to review the batches and press enter and it reconciles back with the GL and stuff.

AR management, we have RPA automation, we set the clock like 15 days, 30 days, 45 days to go out and do claim status checking and bring back the claim status response, and all of that flows back into Epic under the patient's follow up notes. Again, there are some levels of appeal and stuff that has to be done manually. We do have some automated appeals and stuff in place, but a very large part of my central billing office is automated already.

## Client
Understood. Just to bring this discussion, just to summarize this, if you think about the remaining headroom for technology vendors, it's more max like 30%, 40%, maybe 50%?

## Expert
I was about 30% or so.

## Client
I've been having these conversations and I'm getting answers that are a bit all over the place. A lot of people are saying, "Oh, RCM is not automated at all. It's like only 20%, 30% automated and there's still too much labor being used for tasks that can be automated."

## Expert                                        Sean Doolan
DO NOT COPY
That goes back to the answer I gave you, it   sd@virtuevc.com
depends on the organization and how much they want to risk in investing in technology. I'll give you a good example. I'll share a story with you. I inherited a central billing office that was handling my skilled nursing billing. They had about 100+ skilled nursing facilities, like $1.3 billion in collections. Their process was so manual. For instance, the patient registration, their medical documentation is not done in PointClickCare, PCC. They were using a DOS-based billing platform, very DOS-based old platform.

What this office was doing, they were manually taking information from the EHR system, PCC, and loading into the billing software to create their own demographics. They were taking clinical information loaded into the billing software to generate a claim. They will have clearinghouses like Waystar and things like that. Their AR follow-up notes were in a different system called Metforce. Depending on how organizations are set up, it can still be very manual.

I went in there, within a year plus or so, I automated the entire thing. I use PointClickCare for everything because they were equipped to do claims generation, AR follow-up. The same way I have automation with Epic and Waystar, the same thing I did with PointClickCare in that office. The point I'm trying to make, it depends on how the organization is structured. You very well can have a health system that is 40% automated, and they just don't have the right people or the right CFO or right CIO that is willing to take that leap to automate stuff.

In that office that I just shared with you, we had about 500 FTEs, U.S.-based staff and staff offshore. Today, it's less than 80. It's so fully automated. That's how many FTEs I save, labor cost. Of course, my technology costs went up a little bit, but the ROI is much better and then revenue cycle performance is better. They were collecting less than $0.90 on the dollar. Today, we are 98%. It depends on the culture of organization and the risk they want to take.

## Client
I see. I guess your organization might be ahead in automation, but overall in the U.S., would you have a sense about average levels of automation? Is that more representative of some of these stories you're mentioning or do you think still there might be some pockets of low automation, but overall it's still pretty automated?

## Expert
I will break it down my end markets and what I meant by end markets and the size of the organization. On the inpatient acute side, acute hospitals, a lot of them are automated, like 70% or so. You may have some smaller health systems, like standalone hospitals, 300-bed, 400-bed hospitals that maybe they're 40% automated. There are still opportunities in smaller hospitals, mid-sized hospitals.

The large health systems, like Cleveland Clinic health system, Advent, Sutter, Mount Sinai, all these other big health systems in the country, they're pretty automated. They're like, where I am at, 70%, 80%. Again, it depends on the size of the organization. I think smaller size hospitals are less automated. Now on the physician group side and the physician side, I still think that there's a lot of physician groups that are not automated, like 50%. They're using software like ModMed, eClinical, Gateway, NextGen, and things like that.

I think there's a lot of opportunities in the physician world. It's just that's the nature of it. They probably don't want to invest a whole lot of money in technology and things like that. Physician side is about 50%, 60% automated. However, on the post-acute side, like skilled nursing facility, long-term care hospitals, and inpatient rehab, most of them, revenue cycle system, 60% automated. You have to break it down by end market and the size of the health system.

## Client
Understood. There's some sort of competitive tension between the RCM modules of EHR providers and then pure play companies like Waystar. Do you have a sense of who's going to be the winners here? Do you think EHRs are more likely just given their positioning on the clinical side, given the data they hold or do you think it's the pure play companies that are performing better?

### Sean Doolan

## Expert
Today, it's the pure play, the point solution companies are doing better. I think you're not going to have something like Waystar unless they partner with Epic, for instance. Epic, by the way, has integrated a competitor to Waystar in their platform. It's a company called Inovalon or ABILITY. They used to be called ABILITY. What's happening is the EHR, the Epic of the world, it depends on which part of the cycle. What they're doing is they're integrating third-party technology, pure-play technology in their platform and selling that as a bundle. That's a trend you're seeing.

On the physician side, a lot of the EHR, like athenahealth, for instance, they integrated a company called Dorsata to do a lot of the back end stuff. You're going to be seeing that kind of trend happening and sure enough the EHR company could create their own modules and stuff like that to do things more so in the mid-cycle. In the mid-cycle, I see them doing that more and more, having their own modules and things like that.

A big one that's happening right now is scribing. The dictation and voice activation scribing and completing the charts, like Ambient, you have DeepScribe, Nuance, and stuff. You have companies like Epic and Cerner having their own scribing technology. Instead of the physicians and clinicians manually typing the notes, this voice activation technology is doing that for them and they just review it.

You are going to see the EHR companies, depending on which part of the patient's journey, they are going to invest in their own in-house platform, or partner with a pure-play company like Waystar. I think from my perspective, the EHRs are still lacking the best-of-breed point solutions to do certain parts of the cycle very well, unless they integrate with a third-party solution.

## Client
Understood. Are there any activities within RCM that maybe aren't as automatable today, but with AI and general tech development, you think it's very likely could be automated in the future?

# Expert Insights on RCM Technology and Automation

## Expert
I think we talked about prior authorization. There's still a struggle there. It's not perfect. I think there's room there for investment and things like that. I think we talked about autonomous coding, that's still not perfected yet. I think in the back end, some of the RPA solutions that we are using for AR follow-up and things like that, that's not perfected. We talked about the mid-cycle, about chart scrubbing. That's somewhat still in the baby phase. I think there's a lot of room there.

I think also we still have a need for good business intelligence tools for KPIs and dashboarding and things like that. We're still lacking there. I'm using Microsoft Power BI here, a lot of work, but I think there's still room for improvement there. Now I know on the clinical side, there's a lot of stuff that goes on where I think there is needs for patient care and things like that, which I can comment on. That's on a clinical side. At a high level, those are some of the areas I feel like can be improved or lack automation.

We talked about Medicaid pending applications and stuff. I don't think that can be completely automated because the states will not allow us to connect their portal through an automation. Those are some of the big areas. Point of service estimate, sometimes is still wrong. We use Waystar and a company called RevSpring here. Oftentimes the patient estimate, it's over or it's under and things like that and costs, all kinds of reconciliation, refunds and things like that. There's still room there for some better automation as well. Let me think about it. As I mentioned to you, I'm a very active member of HFMA, the largest RCM financial organization in the U.S. I think those are the big ones.

## Client
Understood. What is the level of outsourcing to service providers like R1 RCM and Ensemble? How does that negatively impact the technology spend on RCM? If you're outsourcing, I presume you're not spending as much on technology in-house.

I think those companies, their selling point and their mantra is they're fully automated. I would be very careful. We had R1 at some of my hospitals years ago. I wouldn't buy too much into that they can do end-to-end. To answer your questions, companies like FinThrive, R1, Experience Care, and Ensemble, I think if a health system decides to go with a company like that, those companies are using a lot of automation. If it works, there isn't going to be need to invest in pure play or point solutions.

I can tell you a lot of these large companies that says they can do end-to-end, I'll be very careful with that. They also tend to use pure play companies integrated in their offerings. You will have companies like Ensemble still using Waystar in their portfolio. It's invisible to the client or to the health system, but they themselves, it's the technology that they have, if they claim they're doing end-to-end, it's not 100% owned by them. They're integrating third-party technology as well. If you decide to go to a company like R1, for instance, I'm sure your pure-play spend will go down and costs will be incorporated in the fees that R1 is going to be charging.

Cool. Those are all the questions I had. This has been very helpful. Thanks a lot for taking the time.
