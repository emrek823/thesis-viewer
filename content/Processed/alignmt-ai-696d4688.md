## Slide 1: ALIGNMT A\

ALIGNMT A\
Help people access a better tomorrow by
unblocking healthcare innovation with assurance

Pitch Deck - January 2024

## Slide 2: The Opportunity

2023 AI regulations caught
healthcare enterprises by surprise

**Healthcare AI policy requirements effective Dec 2024**
* 3rd party validation of AI fairness and accuracy
* continued validation of fairness
* ongoing risk monitoring
* ...and other requirements*

The
Opportunity

Turbocharge healthcare innovation by
automating compliance and quality
reporting for Healthcare AI applications

info@alignmt.ai
* ONC HTI-1 Final Rule

## Slide 3: Currently, companies have 3 bad options

Currently, companies have 3 bad options

**Use Incumbents**
*   No real-time monitoring
*   Lack of AI expertise
*   Long test times (6+ months)

**Specific Task Result Details**

| Participant Number | Task Time | Outcome | Deviations |
|:-------------------|:----------|:--------|:-----------|
| P01                | 4:18      | Success | 3          |
| P02                | 5:02      | Success | 0          |
| P03                | 5:32      | Success | 1          |
| P04                | 6:36      | Success | 1          |
| P05                | 7:18      | Fail    | 7          |

**Outsource Compliance Ops**
*   Inaccessible to small companies
*   Limited AI expertise
*   Price prohibitive

**Build In-house**
*   Distraction from core business
*   Hiring talent is hard
*   High infrastructure costs
