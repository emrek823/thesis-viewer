## Slide 9: Earning the right

Earning the right

Discover overlooked female biomarkers
(to do this, we have to gather data at scale)

1. Build a big, diverse community of customers
    (comprehensive dataset)
    * 20% MoM growth
    * Established brand & thought leadership
    * 2 research partnerships live
2. Create value & trust for them so they stay with us
    over time (longitudinal data)
    * Build clinical care (study, lab, PCs, wheel)
    * Launch clinical care
        * 35% margin, 40% opt in, 80% sat
    * 70% retention
    * 80 NPS
    * 80% of our members engage with Evvy's
        community (through coaching, care, FB group,
        reviews, etc.)

Leverage biomarkers to close the gender
health gap
(to do this, we have to prove our data is valuable)

1. Innovate on characterizations of health /
    disease & personalized care
    * 5 novel scores that may be predictive
        biomarkers
    * First pass at improved disease
        stratification based on what treatments
        work for who
2. Power scientific & medical community
    * 2 published research papers
    * First B2B relationship live
    * V1 of SAGE database live with new
        bioinformatics pipeline

## Slide 10: Build a world class team & company

Build a world class team & company

1. Build a world-class company
    * Clean cap table (investors, terms, etc.)
    * Financial & operational excellence (unit
        economics, strong accounting, vendor
