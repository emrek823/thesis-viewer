## Page 34: Testimonials

Testimonials

"I am grateful to Amae Health for the transformation I've witnessed over the past year. With Dr. Scott Fears' guidance, our son has found ways to live with and even to overcome many of the challenges he's been facing. He values the insights Dr. Fears brings to their conversations.

Our son has committed to the medication regimen and the recommendations he's received— from dietary adjustments to engaging in community activities, social interactions, and physical fitness.

The Amae caregiver meetings, especially the family support sessions led by Dr. Gary Tsai, have amplified our empathy for others in similar situations and has fostered hope.

We thank the clinic for their care and for making such a positive impact on our lives."

“I met with one of your members today. She is still impaired but REMARKABLY better compared to when I last met with her."

– UCLA Referring Psychiatrist

"The people at Amae are very friendly and supportive. I've learned a lot of new coping skills and ways to control my intrusive thoughts. With the health coach, I've learned about nutritional foods and getting exercise. With the treatment and the medication, I'm getting better."

Testimonials

"I'm a sister of a member at Amae. I felt immediate relief from the beginning of our first visit to their facility. The staff is incredibly supportive, caring, and immediately follows up when needed. This is unfortunately rare in the mental health field.

Though it's only been less than two months since my brother has joined Amae, I've noticed significant improvement in his overall well-being. For the first time, my brother has accepted that he needs help and is willing and eager to continue to do the work at Amae. We're beyond grateful for the staff at Amae, and I'm excited for him to continue to stay on the right path."

## Page 38: The Professional Services Agreement Advantage

The Professional Services Agreement Advantage

### Key Takeaways

*   Savings to Health System
*   Referral Optimization
*   HEDIS & STAR Improvements

### PSA Model

#### Resources Required
*   All clinical staff can be employed and paid for by Amae, with no costs incurred by CommonSpirit
*   Quality clinical reviews need to be conducted every quarter or half a year for Amae to work in collaboration with CommonSpirit on achieving common quality goals
*   Despite initial set-up pertaining to credentialing, this is resource effective long-term

#### Savings
*   By having a PSA model, Amae is able to take all insurances that CommonSpirit is in-network with
*   Amae focuses on CommonSpirit's population and can save $2-3k per ER visit, reduce length of stay in the inpatient psychiatry unit, and help reduce readmissions which impact STAR ratings

#### Revenue Growth
*   Increase patient volume with reduction in length of stay for ED and Inpatient Psychiatry can lead to substantial revenue increase for CommonSpirit (see next slide for projections)
*   If CommonSpirit has any VBC contracts with quality incentives tied to HEDIS metrics such as readmissions, 7/30 day FUH, Amae can be supportive in helping to achieve the desired outcomes
*   The PSA Model allows CommonSpirit to capture revenue from patients treated by Amae via a revenue sharing arrangement (proposal is for 10% to CommonSpirit for administrative services)

#### Outcomes
*   Amae is able to become the exclusive outpatient SMI provider for CommonSpirit, and can focus on the most frequently re-admitting and costly patients
*   Amae works to keep patients within CommonSpirit system for higher value procedures, and ensures CommonSpirit has higher patient retention as a result
*   Improved continuity of care and care coordination will improve patient outcomes and reduce their medical comorbidities

#### Research & Training
*   Amae will be conducting longitudinal research on the SMI population and joint Research between CommonSpirit and Amae becomes more easily integrated as the back and forth of data sharing is seamless
*   Amae can provide training and potential employment for CommonSpirit's Psychiatry, Internal Medicine and Primary Care residents

| Standard of Care ($10k+ PMPM) | Amae Health ($2.5k PMPM) |
|---|---|
| Frequent ER visits → (~$25k per year) | No ER visits among patients to date |
| Inpatient stays → (~$60k per year) | No inpatient admissions to date |
| Untreated comorbidities → (~$35k per year) | Early detection of comorbidities (completion of metabolic labs, primary care) |
| Minimal primary care and behavioral health outpatient treatment resulting in expensive crisis care | All behavioral health care included |
| Frequently uncoordinated care leading to redundant care and expenses | All primary care included |
| Very poor outcomes tracking | Health coaching included (nutrition, exercise, and sleep programs) |
| Patients negatively impact HEDIS scores (engagement, 7 day follow-up, readmissions, medication adherence, etc) | Coordinated care ensuring no redundant care or expenses |
| | Greatly improved outcomes & focus on HEDIS scores |

For 500 SMI patients, Amae can save a health plan ~$45mm in the next year
