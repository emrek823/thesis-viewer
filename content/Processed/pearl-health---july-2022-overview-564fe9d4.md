## Slide 9: Engaging Technology - Actionable Signals to Automate Value

lliu@generalcatalyst.com

**ENGAGING TECHNOLOGY**
**Actionable Signals to Automate Value**

**Urgency Score vs. Recommended Follow-up**

**Graph Data:**
*   **X-axis:** Time (0 to 120, likely days)
*   **Y-axis:** Urgency Score (0 to 1.0)
*   **Lines:**
    *   **Frail Elderly:** Starts low, increases significantly after ~30 days, peaks around 75 days (score ~1.0), then decreases. Shows a sharp spike around 60 days, possibly due to a discharge event.
    *   **Healthy:** Remains consistently low (close to 0).
*   **Markers/Regions:**
    *   "RECOMMENDED DISCHARGE" around 60 days.
    *   "FOLLOW UP WINDOW" starting after discharge, up to ~90 days.
    *   "TOUCHPOINT" marker around 90 days.

**Commodity Data -> Machine Learning -> Outcomes -> Actions**

**Commodity Data Inputs (diagram):**
*   Demo
*   Coverage
*   SDOH (Social Determinants of Health)
*   EMR (Electronic Medical Records)
*   RPM (Remote Patient Monitoring)
*   ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer)
*   Rx/Lab
*   Claims
*   Appts.

**Aligned Patient Map (Screenshot of UI):**

**Dr. Ruiz (Chat message):**
*   Hi Tobin. This is Dr. Ruiz's office, checking in on how you're doing since you left the hospital. How are you feeling?
*   **Tobin:** I'm still having a lot of pain.
*   **Dr. Ruiz:** I'm sorry to hear that, Tobin. Can you tell me where you are experiencing pain?
*   **Tobin:** In my stomach.
*   **Dr. Ruiz:** Okay, let's schedule some time for you to talk to Ann.

**ENGAGING TECHNOLOGY**
**360° View of Patient Panels from a Value Perspective**

We empower providers to deliver quality care at a lower cost.
*   Visually prioritize patients
*   Intelligent best next steps
*   Satisfying engagement model

**Aligned Patient Map (Screenshot of UI):**
The map shows patients as hexagonal dots, with color (red to blue) and vertical position (Severity) indicating priority. Red dots at the top left represent high severity/urgency, while blue dots at the bottom right are lower severity/less recent touchpoints.

**Legend:**
*   May Need Attention (Red)
*   No Action Required (Blue)

**Patients (361) list:**
*   **O'Conner Tobin**
    *   Under 65 Disabled and ESRD
    *   Discharged (H): 03/22/2022
*   **Langosh Bonnie**
    *   Minor Complex Chronic
    *   Admitted (H): 03/22/2022
*   **Koch Madeline**
    *   Relatively healthy
    *   Last Touchpoint: 379 days ago

**Quote:**

## Slide 11: Engaging Technology - Urgency Algorithm Prioritizes Patient Panels

lliu@generalcatalyst.com

**ENGAGING TECHNOLOGY**
**Urgency Algorithm Prioritizes Patient Panels**

Patient prioritization driven via **proprietary urgency scoring algorithm** that increases urgency dynamically based on patient disease burden and acute events.

*   **Simple.** New data sources improve the algorithm without changing practice use patterns.
*   **Prioritized.** So practices can focus on the most critical patients when staffing is limited.
*   **Actionable.** Pearl identifies urgency drivers and recommended actions.

**Sample Urgency Score for Acute Event**

**Graph Data:**
*   **X-axis:** DAYS (0 to 120)
*   **Y-axis:** Urgency Score (0 to 1.0)
*   **Vertical Markers:**
    *   ER Admission (around day 55)
    *   ER Discharge (around day 65)
    *   RECOMMENDED DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP WINDOW (region from ~day 65 to ~day 90)
    *   TOUCHPOINT (vertical line around day 90)
*   **Lines:**
    *   **Frail Elderly:** Starts low, increases sharply around ER Admission, peaks shortly after ER Discharge (at 1.0), then gradually declines, spiking again slightly around TOUCHPOINT.
    *   **Healthy:** Stays very low, with a small bump around ER Admission/Discharge, but still close to 0.

## Slide 21: Leveraged Growth - Voluntary Alignment (VA) Grows Panel Density

lliu@generalcatalyst.com

**LEVERAGED GROWTH**
**Voluntary Alignment (VA) Grows Panel Density**

The process allows beneficiaries to affirm their primary clinician during the performance year.

*   **Financial Upside**
    *   A larger panel of patients will increase the monthly capitation amount for providers.
*   **Provider Enablement**
    *   Solidifies the relationship between PCP and patient allowing for better coordination.
*   **Empower Patients**
    *   Increases patient involvement in their healthcare journey.

**2022 VA: ~14% Net New Midyear Growth**

After demonstrative pilots in 2023, we can employ more nuanced approaches and technology to expand impact.

*   **Expand National Risk Partner partnerships**
    *   Move from pilots to national scope
    *   Increase disease burden coverage
*   **Local Specialists**
    *   Fill in gaps for regional disease burden hotspots via local specialist risk deals
*   **Expand risk financial model**
    *   Keep % of capitation at-risk via Pearl quality measures
    *   Bonus from shared savings if achieved
*   **Introduce PCP tech flow**
    *   Allow Pearl PCPs to nominate patients not otherwise identified for co-management with risk partners

Now that we have achieved sufficient patient density, we have begun discussions with risk partners.

**Pilot Approach**
*   Define cohorts of patients by clinical risk & geography
*   Allocate Pearl subset of upside/downside global risk
*   Introduce partner to PCP and patient
*   Demonstrate efficacy on MLR, patient & provider satisfaction
*   Targeting 5-10% of TME (‘23) and 20-25% (‘24) shared risk.

Achieving greater panel density will allow practices to more fully convert to value-based care best practices.

*   Build provider concentration
*   Demonstrate model efficacy
    *   Including sufficient portfolio of risk-aligned partners
*   Pitch payors on pilots
*   Share payor risk with PCPs, specialty partners and Pearl

**CAPITAL-EFFICIENT**
**Sample Patient Economic Model**

1.  PCPs are rewarded for reducing Total Medical Expenditures (TME) for their aligned patient population below a set benchmark
2.  Pearl shares a portion of any savings with CMS and with PCPs on Pearl's platform
3.  PCPs pay Pearl a small administrative fee in return for access to Pearl's platform and support

**Illustrative Pearl Health Economics (Bar Chart):**

**Column 1: Initial State**
*   Target Benchmark (Tall Blue Bar)
*   Total Medical Expense (TME) (Slightly shorter Orange Bar)

**Column 2: Savings Generation**
*   % Gross Savings: 9%* (Blue Bar, representing savings from TME)

**Column 3: Savings Distribution**
*   % Savings shared with CMS and PCP (Orange Bar, smaller than gross savings)
*   % Admin Fee from PCP to Pearl (Green Bar, small)

**Column 4: Pearl's Share**
*   % Retained by Pearl: 3%* (Orange Bar, larger portion)
*   Pearl Operating Cost (Blue Bar, subtraction from retained)
*   Pearl Profit (Green Bar, positive outcome)

*   These projections include a 4% Enhanced Primary Capitation percentage, in which Pearl will receive an advance of ~$2.9MM of monthly capitation payments (~$34.8MM annually), to be repaid to CMS at the end of the year at 0% interest.
