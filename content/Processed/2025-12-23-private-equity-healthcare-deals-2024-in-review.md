## **Overview**

In light of private equity’s continued interest in healthcare and the risks associated with private equity ownership of healthcare companies, the Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP) tracks private equity-backed healthcare deals each month and produces an annual report exploring trends in private equity deal activity. This report looks at the 2024 private equity deals data in review, identifying and analyzing recent investment trends in healthcare.

## Key Points

* Despite the headwinds of increasing regulatory scrutiny and high interest rates, private equity firms continued a steady pace of investment in the US healthcare space in 2024, albeit at lower levels than in 2023. PESP identified 1049 unique deals, consisting of 166 buyouts, 262 growth/expansion investments, and 621 add-on acquisitions to 383 unique platform companies in 2024. These deals involved at least 676 private equity firms, business development corporations, venture capital firms, private credit funds, and other types of investors.
* 2024’s 1049 deals represent a 7.6% decrease from the 1135 deals PESP tracked in 2023.
* There were at least 16 private equity firms in 2024 that executed 10 or more healthcare deals. The most active firm by deal count was Latticework Capital Management, which executed 27 deals, including 14 add-ons to its dental care platform company, SALT Dental Collective, and 11 to its behavioral health physician practice management company, Beacon Behavioral Partners.
* Dental care (161 deals), health IT (140), outpatient care (139), medtech (105), and pharma services (80) were the busiest subsectors among those PESP tracked. Home health, home care, & hospice, behavioral health, and disability services were also noteworthy investment targets.
* Dental care saw the highest deal activity (161 deals), with 10.3% more deals than in 2023. Over half of the busiest platform companies in 2024 were dental care companies. MB2 Dental, owned by Warburg Pincus and Charlesbank Capital Partners, had the highest number of add-on acquisitions at 20, followed by Specialized Dental Partners, owned by Quad-C Management, with 18, and SALT Dental Collective, owned by Latticework Capital Management and Resolute Capital Partners, with 14 deals.
* In addition to buyouts, add-on acquisitions, and growth investments, private equity firms are increasingly using joint ventures with nonprofit health systems as a growth strategy that can provide them with trusted brands and access to geographic markets they might otherwise not readily access.
* On January 15, 2025, HHS released its report in response to the public inquiry it launched with the FTC and DOJ in March 2024 to examine consolidation in healthcare markets. The release of the report was one of its last actions under the Biden administration. The report highlights the impacts of increasing consolidation in our nation’s healthcare markets and the recent influx of private equity and other private investors active in the sector.
* Analysts predict a resurgence of healthcare dealmaking in 2025 due to falling interest rates, increased dry powder available to invest, and the expectation that the Trump administration will view private equity investment more favorably than the Biden administration.
* In light of continued investor interest in healthcare and the risks associated with private equity ownership of healthcare companies, including “stealth consolidation” that can lead to higher prices, state and federal policymakers should update laws and regulations to increase oversight of healthcare mergers and acquisitions.

## Summary of data

In 2024, PESP tracked 1049 private equity-backed healthcare deals in the United States, consisting of 262 growth/expansion investments, 166 leveraged buyouts, and 621 add-on acquisitions to 383 unique platform companies. These deals[[1]](#_ftn1) involved at least 676 private equity firms, business development corporations, venture capital firms, private credit funds, and other types of investors.[[2]](#_ftn2)

**Deal types**

* A leveraged buyout (LBO) is when a private equity acquires a company, financing a substantial portion of the acquisition by taking out debt secured by the company it is buying. This means that the debt doesn’t belong to the private equity firm and its investors—it’s instead saddled onto the company being acquired, such as a health system or hospital. In a leveraged buyout, 60 to 90 percent of the transaction will typically be funded by debt.
* A growth/expansion investment is when a private equity firm invests in a company to help it grow, such as to finance new acquisitions. These differ from venture capital investments in that typically the company receiving the investment is more mature and the holding period for the investment will be shorter. These investments usually provide a minority equity stake to the investors, although it’s also possible for investors to establish majority stakes through these types of deals. Investors derive returns from their investment if the company successfully grows its revenue and improves its operating margins.
* An add-on acquisition is when a private equity firm uses a platform company to acquire another company. The platform company is one that the PE firm has already acquired or created to then be used to acquire multiple companies in a particular sector. Using this strategy can help investors’ deals fall under the radar of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which is tasked with reviewing mergers and acquisitions that fall above the Hart-Scott Rodino threshold (which is about $119.5 million in 2024) for potential anticompetitive impacts. Deals that fall under this threshold do not have to be reported to the FTC, allowing private equity firms and other types of investors to use serial acquisitions of smaller companies with the help of a platform company in order to evade antitrust scrutiny.

Add-on deals accounted for nearly 60% of all deals that PESP tracked in 2024.

At least 16 private equity firms completed ten or more healthcare deals in 2024. See **Table 1** for a list of the most active firms by deal count.

At least 13 private equity-owned platform companies made five or more add-on acquisitions in 2024. See **Table 2** for the full list.

Over half of these platforms were dental care companies. MB2 Dental, owned by Warburg Pincus and Charlesbank Capital Partners, had the highest number of add-on acquisitions at 20, followed by Specialized Dental Partners, owned by Quad-C Management, with 18, and Salt Dental Collective, owned by Latticework Capital Management and Resolute Capital Partners, with 14 deals.

Latticework and Resolute also own a behavioral health platform company, Beacon Behavioral Partners, which made at least 11 add-on acquisitions in 2024.

U.S. Oral Surgery Management, Southern Orthodontic Partners, Dental365, Elevate ENT Partners, and Specialized Dental Partners also made the list of most active platform companies in 2023. For more information, see PESP’s report: “[Private Equity in U.S. Healthcare: Trends in 2023 Deal Activity](https://pestakeholder.org/private-equity-healthcare-2023-trends/).”

In 2024, there was an average of 87 healthcare deals per month. The most deal activity occurred in January (111 deals), April (100 deals), and June (104 deals). See **Figure 2**. The January deal count was particularly high and may be the result of a disproportionate number of deals being announced at the start of the year.

## Private equity dealmaking context in 2024

The 1049 private equity healthcare deals that PESP tracked in 2024 represent a 7.6% decrease from the 1135 deals PESP tracked in 2023. Note that PESP’s deal tracking takes into account deal volume (i.e. number of deals) but not deal values, since often times values are not reported for private equity transactions. PESP also only examines deal activity in the US.

Globally, 2024 was the second highest year on record for private equity healthcare dealmaking value, according to consulting firm Bain & Company, with total deal value at approximately $115 billion. North America accounted for 65% of global deal value. [[22]](#_ftn22)  However, private equity healthcare deal volume continued to be relatively subdued in the US compared to its 2021 peak, especially in healthcare services (e.g. outpatient care).[[23]](#_ftn23) PwC reported a 9% decrease in healthcare services deals from 2023 to November of 2024, but noted that annual deal volume through November 15, 2024 was still 70% higher than pre-COVID.[[24]](#_ftn24) While PwC’s numbers also include non-private equity deals, they provide an approximation of overall health sector trends.

Overall private equity deal activity, both in healthcare and all other industries, began to slow down in 2021 and new dealmaking is currently “sluggish.”[[25]](#_ftn25) The primary driver behind this trend is a high interest rate environment that makes it more challenging for firms to sell assets and buy assets because debt is now expensive and can be challenging to secure. Private equity firms still see substantial opportunity in the healthcare arena, including healthcare providers, and we can expect to see more deals as interest rates come down. Indeed, Pitchbook expects global private equity and other private fund assets under management to reach $20-$24 trillion by 2028 (from $14.7 trillion now).[[26]](#_ftn26)

**Increased regulatory scrutiny of private equity in 2024**In addition to macroeconomic trends impacting the larger economy, private equity investors in US healthcare faced increased scrutiny in 2024 from researchers, journalists, policymakers, and regulators, spurred by a growing body of evidence documenting private equity’s negative effects in healthcare, including the rise in private equity-driven healthcare bankruptcies since 2023.[[27]](#_ftn27)

In healthcare, private equity acquisitions are contributing to and have contributed to consolidation, which is often accompanied by higher prices in various subsectors, [[28]](#_ftn28)  including [emergency medicine](https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/1/1/qxad008/7203733), [eye care](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/private-equity-ophthalmology-eye-care-high-profit-procedures/), [gastroenterology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10548246/), [durable medical equipment](https://pestakeholder.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PESP_Report_DME_2023.pdf), [anesthesiology](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/29/private-equity-medical-practices-raise-prices/), [physical therapy](https://www.providenthp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Evolving-MA-Landscape-in-the-Physical-Therapy-Sector.pdf), [dental care](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2023/5/consolidation-dsos-secondary-private-equity-sales/), [fertility clinics](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/private-equity-buyouts-fertility-consolidation), [methadone treatment centers](https://www.statnews.com/2024/03/19/methadone-clinics-opioid-addiction-private-equity/), and [air ambulances](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/04/how-private-equity-took-over-air-ambulances.html).

Multiple case studies and journalistic investigations have demonstrated how private equity ownership of healthcare companies can negatively impact quality of care, access to care, and staffing levels. Recent empirical research supports the findings in these case studies. A 2023 peer-reviewed study demonstrated that private equity acquisition of hospitals was associated with a 25.4 percent increase in hospital-acquired conditions, including falls and bloodstream infections.[[29]](#_ftn29) A 2023 systematic review of the research on private equity ownership and its impacts on health outcomes, costs, and quality found that private equity ownership was associated with reduced nurse staffing levels.[[30]](#_ftn30) A 2021 study showed that private equity acquisition of nursing homes was associated with higher costs and increases in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for certain conditions.[[31]](#_ftn31)

2024 saw multiple state legislatures[[32]](#_ftn32) and members of Congress[[33]](#_ftn33) introduce and debate legislation that would curtail some of the harmful business practices of private equity firms in healthcare and bring greater oversight to healthcare transactions involving private equity. Three states – Indiana, New Mexico, and Massachusetts – ultimately passed legislation that increased oversight over healthcare deals, including private equity dealmaking.[[34]](#_ftn34)

In May 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division jointly [launched](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/05/ftc-doj-seek-info-serial-acquisitions-roll-strategies-across-us-economy) a public inquiry on serial acquisitions and roll-up strategies used by corporate actors, including private equity firms, ac
