At Zingage, our mission is simple: ensure every patient gets the care they need at home. Today, we're excited to share two major milestones that bring us closer to that mission: a $12.5 million seed round led by Bessemer Venture Partners, and the launch of **Zingage Operator**, our AI-powered care delivery platform.

##### The Future of Healthcare Is at Home

Healthcare is moving home. With aging populations, rising costs, and patient preference driving a $500 billion market shift, families want care delivered where it matters most. But today's systems weren't built for the realities of 24/7 care. Agencies juggle hospital discharges, caregiver call-outs, and compliance deadlines with phones and spreadsheets—tools never designed for the logistics of home care.

That's where Zingage comes in.

"Growing up in a family of nurses and home care owners, I saw how much it took from providers to deliver care around the clock to our most vulnerable populations. Right now, across America, there are patients missing care because a provider didn't have the bandwidth to answer the phone, let alone find someone to cover the shift," said **Victor Hunt, Zingage CEO and co-founder**. "We're building the technology that enables providers to reach all patients where they want to be: at home."

##### Introducing Zingage Operator

Operator is the first AI platform built to manage the full cycle of home care delivery: from intake to scheduling to billing.

What once meant late-night heroics and endless spreadsheets is now automated by AI. Zingage Operator learns from real labor data to make better staffing decisions over time, while voice AI communicates directly with caregivers and patients in real time. The result: more shifts filled, fewer missed visits, and reliable documentation for payers.

Agencies using Operator during beta are already seeing the impact—taking on more patients, improving care quality, and giving managers time back to focus on people, not paperwork.

As **John Bennett, CEO of Sunny Days In-Home Care**, puts it: "With Zingage Operator, our team is now handling 2x the volume while feeling like they're working less. Instead of being in the weeds of scheduling, our field managers are back out in the community, focused on what matters most: making sure clients are getting the care they need and that our caregivers are satisfied."

##### Backed by Leading Investors

Our progress has attracted support from some of the best investors in the world, including **Bessemer Venture Partners, TQ Ventures, South Park Commons, WndrCo**, and executives from **Ramp**.

"Victor and Daniel see this market from every perspective: the family struggling to find care, the agency drowning in coordination chaos, and the massive demographic shift driving demand," said **Steve Kraus, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners**. "We invested in Zingage because they have a deep passion to improve the lives of home care agency owners, patients, and caregivers, combined with deep knowledge in agentic AI to build the infrastructure for more seamless and efficient administration of home care," added **Sofia Guerra, Vice President at Bessemer Venture Partners**.

We're honored to have their partnership as we scale.

##### Our Story

Founded in 2023, Zingage is built by operators, for operators. Victor and Daniel began by embedding inside agencies, even running shifts themselves, to understand the real pain points. That's why every feature of Operator is designed with one goal: **make home care reliable, scalable, and human again**.

##### What's Next

With this new funding, we're expanding our engineering, operations, and customer support teams. Our goal is to serve more agencies across the country, helping them grow while ensuring patients receive the care they deserve.

Everything we build starts with our customers. We're continuing to work alongside agency operators every day, listening, learning, and iterating on what truly moves the needle for their operations. This funding accelerates our ability to innovate faster and deliver the tools that make their lives easier and their care more reliable
