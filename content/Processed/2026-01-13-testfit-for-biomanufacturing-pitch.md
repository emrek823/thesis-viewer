# BioFit: Generative Design for Biomanufacturing Facilities

**The pitch in one sentence:** TestFit generates 3,000 apartment layouts in 3 seconds—we do the same for GMP biomanufacturing facilities, cutting 18-36 month design cycles and avoiding $millions in iteration.

## The 5-Minute Pitch to Arco Murray

### 1. The Problem (60 sec)

Biomanufacturing facility design is **expensive, slow, and high-stakes**:

| Metric | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Cost | $350-$1,000+/sq ft depending on GMP class |
| Timeline | 18-36 months from concept to start-up |
| Iteration | Manual layout → engineer review → cost estimate → repeat |
| Risk | Overbuilding strains finances; underbuilding kills growth |

**The pain is acute now:** Post-COVID biomanufacturing buildout, cell/gene therapy facilities, mRNA production expansion. Every design decision echoes through $6M-$100M+ projects.

*Source: [BioProcess International](https://www.bioprocessintl.com/facility-design-engineering/construction-and-start-up-costs-for-biomanufacturing-plants) reports $6M for 10,000 sq ft GMP facility; larger facilities hit $100M+.*

### 2. The Inspiration: What TestFit Proved (45 sec)

**TestFit** ($22M raised, $10k/year SaaS) proved generative design works for "commodity" real estate:
- **Input:** Site constraints, zoning, unit mix, financial targets
- **Output:** 3,000 layouts in 3 seconds, ranked by yield, cost, efficiency
- **Result:** 4-10x faster site planning, 92% close deals faster

*Key insight:* Multifamily buildings seemed "too complex" for automation until TestFit parameterized the constraints. **Biomanufacturing constraints are ALSO parametric**—GMP classes, cleanroom specs, process flows, utility corridors.

### 3. The Product: BioFit (90 sec)

**Generative design for biomanufacturing facilities.**

**Inputs (what the user defines):**
- Site physical: footprint, ceiling height, existing infrastructure
- GMP requirements: ISO class by zone, Annex 1 compliance
- Process type: mAb, cell therapy, viral vector, fill/finish
- Capacity targets: liters/year, batch size, multi-product flexibility
- Equipment library: bioreactor footprints, chromatography skids, HVAC requirements

**Outputs (what the AI generates):**
- Hundreds of compliant facility layouts in seconds
- Ranked by: cost/sq ft, time-to-start, operational flexibility, expansion capacity
- Automatic: utility corridor routing, personnel/material flow separation, cleanroom adjacencies
- Export to: Revit, AutoCAD, BIM systems

**The magic:** Instead of 3 design iterations over 6 months, explore 300 in an afternoon. Find the layout that hits GMP compliance at $450/sq ft instead of $800/sq ft.

### 4. Why This Doesn't Exist Yet (45 sec)

**Current tools solve the wrong problem:**
- **Dassault 3DEXPERIENCE:** Digital twins for *process* optimization, not *facility layout*
- **Autodesk Generative:** Mechanical parts, not regulated buildings
- **BIM tools:** Model what you've designed, don't generate designs
- **PlantStream:** Piping routing, not facility-level planning

**The gap:** No one has built the "TestFit constraint engine" for GMP-compliant facilities. The parametric rules exist (ISPE guidelines, Annex 1, ISO 14644)—they just haven't been encoded into generative design software.

### 5. Why Arco Murray (45 sec)

**You're the perfect partner** for three reasons:

1. **FlexShell already exists.** Your proprietary modular biomanufacturing design is a constraint library waiting to be parameterized. BioFit could generate FlexShell configurations instantly.

2. **Design-build model = decision velocity.** You don't hand off to separate architects/engineers. Faster design exploration = more competitive wins, faster client decisions.

3. **Life sciences is your growth bet.** You established ARCO Life Science & Advanced Manufacturing specifically for this. J&J, GSK, Bayer, MilliporeSigma are your clients. They're all building.

**The ask:** Partner to build this. You have the domain expertise and client relationships. We build the generative engine. Or: you acquire/acqui-hire and own the category.

## Key Constraints to Parameterize (Product Roadmap)

### Regulatory/Classification
- ISO 14644 cleanroom classifications (ISO 5-8)
- GMP grades (A, B, C, D)
- Annex 1 sterile manufacturing requirements
- BSL levels (1-4)

### Process-Specific
- Personnel/material flow separation (unidirectional flow)
- Gowning room cascade requirements
- Airlock staging
- Equipment footprints by vendor (Cytiva, Sartorius, Pall)

### Utility/Infrastructure
- HVAC air change rates by classification
- Utility corridor routing
- Clean-in-place (CIP) system adjacency
- Waste inactivation pathways

### Financial/Operational
- Cost modeling by zone classification
- Expansion modularity scoring
- Multi-product campaign flexibility
- Time-to-operational-start optimization

---

## Competitive Moat

1. **Constraint library is defensible.** Encoding ISPE guidelines + Annex 1 + vendor equipment specs into a generative engine takes domain expertise.

2. **Equipment vendor partnerships.** Integrate equipment libraries from Cytiva, Sartorius, Pall—they want their products specified.

3. **Network effects with clients.** Every project improves the constraint engine. Arco Murray's project volume creates a data moat.

4. **Regulatory complexity is a barrier.** Generalists (Autodesk, etc.) won't invest in GMP-specific compliance logic.

---

## Risks & Open Questions

**Technical:**
- How constrained is the solution space? (May be narrower than multifamily, which is a feature)
- Integration with existing BIM workflows critical for adoption

**Market:**
- Biomanufacturing buildout could slow (macro-dependent)
- Large pharma may build internally rather than buy tools

**Execution:**
- Requires deep GMP/regulatory expertise to build correctly
- Wrong constraints = non-compliant designs = liability

---

## Recommendations

1. **Build a proof-of-concept** with Arco Murray using 2-3 recent project types (mAb production, cell therapy, fill/finish)

2. **Validate constraint library** with their engineering team—they know what rules actually matter

3. **Price at design-build margin.** If this saves 3 months on a $50M project, it's worth $500k, not $10k

4. **Start with FlexShell.** Their modular approach is already partially parameterized—lowest-effort first product
