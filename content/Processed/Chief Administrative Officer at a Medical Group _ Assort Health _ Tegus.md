Assort Health - Chief Administrative Officer at a Medical Group

Interview conducted on July 09, 2025

Topics
Patient Satisfaction, Practice Management, Pricing Strategy, AI Healthcare, Customer Support, Call Center, Connectivity, Market Entry

Summary
A chief administrative officer of a retina-specific practice shared their positive experience with Assort Health, a tool that has significantly reduced missed calls, improved patient satisfaction, and operational efficiency. The expert rates their satisfaction with Assort at 9/10 and mentions that the pricing is a flat fee based on the potential number of calls the tool could replace. They have not explored other options since they are content with Assort's performance, and see potential for Assort to expand into a more comprehensive communication platform for medical practices.

Expert Details
Chief Administrative Officer at a Medical Group, a customer of Assort. The expert is a customer of Assort and can speak to the services they provide.

Chief Administrative Officer at a Medical Group. Reporting to the Board of Directors, the expert is responsible for a fixed clinical location with six offices. The company offers vitreoretinal surgical services to patients, conducts research into ophthalmic care, and everything from determining proper care to finding new therapies for blinding diseases.

Previously the expert was Director of Administration at California Cancer Associates for Research and Excellence (CCARE), leaving in February 2020. The expert introduced revenue cycle best practices to improve revenue collection, negotiated PPO and Managed Care contracts, developed employee growth and retention programs, and improved patient services through lean process improvements.

Q: Please briefly describe your experience with AI tools used for inbound calls and customer service.
A: We use Assort as part of our call center. It's been great. We went live at the end of March and it has made a significant impact on our call workflow. We've seen an improvement in caller feedback, it's allowed us to save money by ending a relationship with another vendor and re-aligning staff to new roles.

Q: Do you currently use any AI tools to automate inbound calls and/or customer service? Please list any you use or have evaluated.
A: We are currently using Assort AI.

Client
Thanks for taking the call. I'm researching AI healthcare customer support industry. Maybe to start, it'd be good to learn a little bit about the company that you're at, how many clinics there are, if that metric's relevant, how many call center employees you have, or customer support, and then also your vantage point for this topic of AI helping optimize patient and customer support. We can start there.

Expert
I'm the chief administrative officer for a six-location, seven-physician, retina-specific practice. We see under 50,000 appointments a year. We developed a call center about two years ago because we get about 10,000 calls a month. Before the call center, we found that we were missing over 30% of our calls because they

were going to our front desk. Our front desk was busy with a lot of other front desk duties like checking new patients and picking up on calls and things like that.

We developed a call center hoping that we would be able to reduce the number of missed calls and answer more calls because most of our calls, as we're doing this investigation, we found were either scheduling related, which is patients calling in to verify their schedule, cancel their schedule, reschedule, and whatnot. We know a significant number of calls were related to that, and a number of calls were related to referring doctors wanting to send patients to us, which is our pipeline, our bloodline.

Being a specialty clinic, that's the majority of our patients come to us through those referrals. It's really important that those doctors are able to get through to us. Otherwise, they can call our competitors and send patients there. We developed a call center, and the call center, we were able to reduce our missed calls to around 25%, but we still had a significant number of calls being missed. We thought that we were still getting complaints from referring doctors saying that as they were trying to call in, no one's picking up. Therefore, they would text our doctors, our doctors would get upset that we're not getting these referrals.

Around November of 2024, Assort actually reached out to me because I was going to attend the athenahealth, which is our practice management system conference. I had the ophthalmology user group, and I'm also on the RCM advisory board. They knew I was going to be at the conference because I had a speaking engagement there too. They wanted to introduce themselves. They let me know that they're going to be connected with a couple of orthopedic practices that utilize athena. I was like, "Okay, if you're already connected with athena, that's an important thing."

That's something that I look for in all technology that we might introduce into the practice for operations, because if those tools can't connect to our primary practice management system or electronic health record, depending on what it is we want to do, then it becomes, instead of optimizing our operations, it makes it more difficult. The fact that the connector was great and the fact that they already had experience with specially orthopedics was really good too. They've never worked with a retina practice. In retina, there are specific nuances that, especially when it comes to scheduling, are important.

Taking a step back, one of the things they talked about was that the focus is on addressing those scheduling calls. At that time too, Assort was the only one that we were aware of that connected to athena. Since then, I know a couple of other AI agents connect to athena now as well too. We decided to sign up with them in December, and our contract went live in January, but from January through April was the designated build-period. The reason that they wanted a longer build-period, and we thought it'd be important, is being their first retina practice. Understand that there's a lot of nuances to retina scheduling. We wanted to make sure that they were able to get it right.

From January through April, we went through the build process. They were actually done March 28th and were able to go live March 28th with Assort. Since then, in the past few months, we were able to identify that more than half of our calls were scheduling-related and Assort was answering about 4,000-5,000 calls a month and has about a 95% accuracy rate in scheduling those appointments or rescheduling or canceling or doing what needs to be done.

We've been impressed with the patient satisfaction score, which is about, I think, 4.3/5 stars right now. It's significantly lifted a burden off of our operations, so much so that we recently decided to part ways with another vendor that we were utilizing because we didn't have enough manpower. Now that we do have manpower, instead of firing people, we just reassign them to this new group. That's going to save me over $90,000 a year on that end, and hopefully be able to provide even greater customer service.

Client
Yeah. A lot of good information there. I think you hit on a lot of my questions, but maybe back up a little bit. Who exactly was on your radar when you were looking to adopt something like Assort Health? Who was on the short list and who were the final players that you were evaluating?

Expert
Parakeet and Hello were two that I was becoming aware of, but at that time, Parakeet wasn't connected to

athena, so I didn't go really deeply into it. Really, Assort was the first to market when I first looked at connectivity I was looking for, so I didn't really pay attention to it too much, but I did look at Parakeet and Hello health.

Client
Okay. Since then, have you come across any others?

Expert
I haven't really too much, only because we've been happy with Assort, and it's doing what it needs to be doing. We haven't really been able to look anywhere else.

Client
Okay. Could you tell us a little bit about how much you're roughly spending with Assort per year?

Expert
Yeah. It's over $50,000 a year.

Client
Okay. Is that price based on the number of locations or the number of call center agents?

Expert
It's a flat fee. The way I priced it when I was negotiating with them, I was looking at how many people could this potentially replace? The one thing I was doing when I was looking at how to improve our call center operations and KPIs, I was thinking of adding more people. We had three people, but I was looking at adding about three more at that time, thinking that maybe the problem is that I don't have enough resources picking up the phone. Each person where we're based is over $4,000 a month to me. We work with an outsourcing firm in Colombia, South America. There, I get two people for over $4,000.

I was like, either I'm going to spend around $15,000 at most if I hire two people in the U.S., or two people from Colombia and one person from America would be about $10,000. I was looking and, "Okay, I don't want to necessarily pay more than $5,000 a month for this tool." We negotiated that that would be the price until it picks up 13,000 calls. After 13,000 calls, we would renegotiate. The way we came up with 13,000 calls was basically, "Well, I know I'm getting 10,000 calls, and at some point I can envision Assort basically answering all of our calls," and then just triaging them as needed. That's how we came up with the price that we paid.

Client
Great. How has your satisfaction been with Assort so far? What would you give it as a product experience rating on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best, what would you give it as a rating?

Expert
I would give it a 9/10. Does anything get a 10/10, but a 9/10, highly recommend them. We've been able to really see significant improvement in our operations, so really happy with it.

Client
Okay. Anything they can improve to make it a 10/10?

Expert
I do it for free. I don't really know.

Client
Okay. Did you say, had you heard of another player called Hello Patient? Did you ever look at them?

Expert
Yeah. I just called them Hello health. I don't know if they're called Hello Patient or if those are two different things, but it was an AI voice-agent tool.

Client
Okay, did you evaluate them? How deep did you go with that?

Expert
I just briefly looked at their website. I didn't go much into detail because at that point, back in November, they didn't have an integration with athena, so it wasn't worth it for me to look at.

Client
Okay. Could you tell us a little bit about the Assort use cases in detail? Are they able to handle calls and schedule patients? Is there any AI agentic actions going on after the call is received? Do they make any outbound calls as well? Maybe you can talk about the full scope of what they're handling.

Expert
Sure. Right now, what they're handling is basically, when anyone calls into one of our offices, it goes to a phone tree first. If the person presses one, it's usually a referring doctor's office and that goes directly to a live person for now. If it's a schedule-related call, they'll press two and that goes to Assort. Now, once it's a scheduling-related call, Assort is able to connect into athena, identify the patient, make sure it's the correct patient.

Using the algorithms that we programmed into it as to how an appointment needs to be scheduled, for example, in retina, if a patient is getting an injection into their eye, say, the next appointment can't be less than 28 days from their previous appointment, and so Assort is able to look at the appointment history. If a person says, "Oh, yeah. I want to cancel my appointment next week and it's on a Wednesday and can I come in on a Tuesday?" If that Wednesday was 28 days from the day of the last injection, it can't schedule them the day before. It has to schedule them after Wednesday.

I would say in a certain parameter too, it can't do it any days before and it can't do it more than two weeks after the original appointment day. It's able to go through all of that, look at the appointment history in athena, and then based on those parameters, reschedule that patient, cancel that appointment, or just schedule that patient for their appointment after all. Once it cancels, reschedules, whatever action it takes, it sends a text message to that patient to confirm what was just discussed.

If Assort is not able to understand the patient, or if the patient doesn't want to talk to Assort, then the patient, all they have to do is say, "Receptionist," or press zero and it'll go to one of our live operators. We still have one full-time and one part-time live operator that are able to handle all of the volume now. Currently, Assort is focused just on anything related to scheduling. We're working with them on also taking on after-hour calls because we realize that there's a lot of after-hour calls that we get that are scheduling related and the on-call doctor doesn't really need to answer those. We're working on programming that.

We're also working with Assort on instead of having the phone tree that we have internally answer calls first, it would be Assort answering the call and then triaging it with the hopes to then further developing a new patient referral platform through Assort. I call it that because we get new patient referrals through phone calls and faxes and our online web form. I would rather have one platform that we're able to manage all three of those methods instead of having Assort handle our phone calls and us handling our faxes and our web forms separately. Just so it's all well-organized and we can get track of those referrals. That's our process.

Client
Okay. You said Assort replaced another software product that you were using.

Basically, what it allowed us to do was replace a vendor that we were utilizing to talk to patients about financial assistance. The way we were able to replace them is because I was able to take two of my call center folks and move them over to this new internal group that we developed, and that's why we didn't need the vendor anymore. It wasn't replacing another AI agent, it was just replacing another operational function.

Client
Okay. Overall, any metrics on how Assort was able to improve things in ROI? Were you able to cut down the call center agents by a certain amount? Were you able to reposition a few employees? What are the metrics?

Expert
Exactly. The immediate metric is that we're able to reassign two call center employees to this new group that we formed internally. By doing that, we were able to end our partnership with another vendor. That's where we're saving $100,000 at a minimum, because that vendor would take 10% of whatever they were able to collect from patient financial assistance. Now, because we assigned two of our team members into our call center into this group, we were able to utilize someone part time within our organization. That's why we have now one and a half people in our call center instead of three. That's basically what we're able to do on that end.

Other measures, just seeing that patient satisfaction. We didn't have patient satisfaction on phone calls before, but we at least now know that patients rated like a 4.4 or 4.5/5 on their interactions with that so that's really good. It's still a little new. We haven't really surveyed our referring doctor's offices on whether or not they're happier, but anecdotally, we know that they haven't been reaching out to our physicians as much because they couldn't get through. They're getting through more often. We see that as well too.

Client
Got you. The main savings were two people repositioned, and then you save over $100,000 because you cut out another vendor. Was that outsourced services? Is that what the other vendor was doing?

Expert
Yeah.

Client
Great. How much does Assort allow you to measure the customer sentiment related to the call? Sounds like they can complete a survey saying if they're happy or not, but any other insight into how effective it is?

Expert
Yeah. Just a survey. It sends out a survey after the phone call. I think they use a net promoter score type of thing. If a patient would like to leave a message, the messages that we've gotten are, they've been impressed with the clarity of the agent, the efficiency by which they've been able to get through, and most importantly, just being able to get through. That's been something that a lot of patients have remarked both through the surveys and then also letting our doctors know that they've been really happy with it.

Client
Awesome. How would you rate the Assort team on a scale from 1-10? I don't know if you interacted with the founders or who you interacted with, but curious what you would give that as a rating.

Expert
Yeah. I've interacted with the founders, obviously, our top manager and some of the engineers. I would rate them really high though, nines, 10s. They're committed to the technology, they have really great customer service, they're responsive, they're realistic. I think there is a tendency for people like myself and other operators that are excited about AI but may not know everything about it or its capabilities, we tend to want it to do everything but it's valuable to be able to trust the developers.

The type of relationship they've been able to build with us, I trust when they say that, they're being realistic, but they're saying, "Well, we can't do that right now. This is our plan," versus somebody who is always trying upsell me or something like that. It's been a really good relationship, and I've come to trust them and rely on their understanding and knowledge of where AI is today and where it is headed, and how they are interested in working with medical practices to best utilize AI.

Client
Great. Do you anticipate being an Assort customer for multiple years?

Expert
Yeah. If there's an issue, I expect them to be really responsive. I don't see a problem with that. I think our pricing is pretty good. I'm happy with that. Switching over would take a pretty significant act or reason, why we're looking for something else or deciding to use it.

Client
Okay. If they said they're not making a lot of money off your contract and had to double the price, how would you react? Would you have to switch to something else or would you pay it?

Expert
I would want to understand why. What further value can we derive out of that? Again, as a layperson, my understanding of technology is that the price of utilizing technology should decrease over time because of the improvements in technology. It's like, "Well, why are my prices increasing if the use of technology price should be decreasing?" It depends on what all the reasons are.

Client
Okay. Of the products you've looked at, do you see any technical differentiation between the products or is it all customer relationship management?

Expert
The technical differences, I'd say is that how well do they integrate with the source material of information they're going to be using to do the job they're supposed to be doing. By that I mean, for most practices, schedules sit in the practice management piece, whether that practice management piece is from the same vendor as the EHR or a separate vendor. That integration, one, the practice management tool itself has to be capable of a high level of integration. Two, the AI tool has to be able to not just integrate, but really move within the program and understand how the program works.

For example, going back to our scheduling and being able to look at the person's prior appointment to see how many days ago it was to be able to determine when that next appointment should be, something like that. If a tool can't do that, then it's quite simple now useful it is because then you're going to be putting patients at all in the wrong place and you'll have to have someone do all the work over again. That would be useless.

Having a high level of integration is really important. I don't think all AI tools are there, but also, not all practice management systems are as advanced as athena's is, whereas as well of integration capabilities as they do. That's actually.

The other thing too, I would say is that I've come across other peers of mine who have tried other voice AI agents and they haven't been satisfied because one thing is that those companies tended to just have one product and force their product the way it is onto the medical practice instead of taking the time to understand what the medical practice actually needs in conforming their products to the needs of the medical practice. With us, we have to relook at and revamp some of our workflows and whatnot. That was more of an improvement in how we do things than necessarily totally changing what we're doing.

That's one thing I appreciate about Assort, even though it took three months to launch, but because they were able to really take the time to understand what our needs are, what our tools are, what our technology

is, it's probably why we've been really satisfied in the past three months now that we've been flagging them, and it's working compared to what some of my peers have said about tools they've tried.

Client
Thank you. Your peers, which players do they seem to be talking about? Is Assort the buzziest or are there others that are up there?

Expert
Assort's the buzziest because people, in my experience, they see the value that Assort has had with us. There's so many AI agents right now, everyone's trying to create something, and so it will be almost impossible for me to throw out names out there. Right now, in the retina space, Assort's probably getting a lot of attention.

Client
Awesome. Last question is I think you talked about how you would like Assort to also handle text and fax, one platform would be nice. What else would you like to see Assort expand into? If you were the CEO of Assort, what would you be adding next in terms of features or capabilities or moving into a new product line?

Expert
What I would do is probably look at the whole communication platform or process for a medical practice and see to build out Assort to be a true, all-encompassing communication platform. Somebody's going to create an awesome AI-enabled or AI-EMR practice management system at some point, but these voice AI agents, I think at this point, you have to pick one of two goals.

You're either going to try to develop a whole EMR-PM system, and it's going to be a heavy lift and take a lot of investment in time, or you could continue building on something that they've already created, which is part of a communication platform, and continue building out that platform by enabling, for example, new patient referral management, outbound communications to patients as a whole, whether through phone calls, text, or email.

Maybe even being able to work with physician groups and saying, "Hey, do you want us to make outbound calls to do patient recalls," and things like that. I think that would be an easier and more natural evolution of these voice AI agents in particular.

Client
Awesome. What do you use for your CCaaS or your telephony for the contact center?

Expert
Yeah. Our Voice over IP system is through Nextiva.

Client
Well, thank you again for your time today. This was very helpful. Bye.
