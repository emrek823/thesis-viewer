**$278k annual gross profit per doctor with $834k gross margin LTV over 36 months, fully loaded LTV:CAC of 16.3x at 12 months(1)**

**Annual Gross Profit per Doctor Calculation:**
$245 (Visit rate) x 45% (Gross profit margin) x 12 (Visits per day) x 210 (Working days) = $278k (Annual gross profit per doctor)

## Slide 9: We have a clear path to >$1.5B in revenue and >$425M in EBITDA with significant upside.

INVESTOR PRESENTATION | WINTER 2024

**We have a clear path to >$1.5B in revenue and >$425M in EBITDA with significant upside.**

We produce savings of $8,400 per member per year. Taking 35% of the savings would result in $190M of additional revenue and 75% gross margins. Using 2028 estimates this would result in 2028 producing **$2.7B in revenue and 20x growth.**

**Value-Driving Insights:**

*   **Psychiatry leads to LTV magic** as their patients are referred to our other services.
*   Each **therapy patient represents a 76% increase in patient LTV** an ~10% lift in patient adherence to care (retention).
*   **Savings leads to CAC magic** as insurers are incentivized to send Talkiatry their members.
*   Each **IOP patient is an additional $16k in LTV**.

## Slide 12: Behavioral healthcare is an archaic, costly, and inefficient experience for all parties.

INVESTOR PRESENTATION | WINTER 2024

**Behavioral healthcare is an archaic, costly, and inefficient experience for all parties.**

*   **45%** Of psychiatrists don't accept insurance
*   **73** Days, average wait for an appointment
*   **60%** Of adults don't receive care
*   **$14.3k** Annual cost per member to payors

**Problems for each party:**
*   **Patients don't know where to go.**
*   **Insurers struggle to gain insight and get patients to the right type of provider.**
*   **Providers are forced to sacrifice quality and, ultimately increase costs to insurers.**

## Slide 13: Our software platform and model produces unprecedented outcomes for our partners.
