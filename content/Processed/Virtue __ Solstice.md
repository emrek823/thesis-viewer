### Deck Structure & Content Strategy

- Opening slide effectiveness debate
	- 2.3M ARR hook generates immediate investor interest/questions
	- Current format balances momentum, expansion (14x ACV), market credibility
	- Need more specific language: “momentum” vs “proven pain,” “expansion” vs generic terms
	- Biggest pharma logos already clients - emphasize this point directly

### Market Positioning Issues

- Scope mismatch between problem presentation and actual solution
	- Currently pitching entire commercial stack (100B opportunity)
	- Actually focused only on content execution + media activation (~20B subset)
	- Need to isolate specific bottleneck being solved vs broader industry problems
- Competitive differentiation unclear
	- Generic language: “fragmentation, broken feedback loops”
	- Must specify what’s uniquely broken in content/media space
	- Jasper comparison critical - show pharma-specific advantages

### Technical Depth & Defensibility

- Current slides too simplistic for Series A level
	- LLM architecture complexity not showcased
	- Need “cracked out architecture” slide for technical credibility
	- Content generation expertise vs generic AI tools unclear
- Brand-level defensibility story needs strengthening
	- AOR relationships are lifetime commitments
	- Clinical data + regulatory knowledge creates switching costs
	- Iterative PRC cycles build institutional knowledge

### Pitch Refinements & Next Steps

- Why Now slide requires fundamental rework
	- Move beyond patent cliff (everyone knows this)
	- Focus on precision medicine driving content complexity
	- Specific LLM advances enabling pharma content generation
- Engagement model comparison needs quantification
	- Add third column showing ROI deltas (90% faster, cost comparisons)
	- Extend growth projections through 2027 (Series A timeline)
	- Start timeline from Q1 pivot point to show full growth trajectory
