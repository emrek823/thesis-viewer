Commentary: There are other companies today (image above) with patient payments offerings where Mural wins on product experience as a result of many of the non-obvious nuances around patient payments that Sam brings with his experience (no fees, international tax, flexible payment options, etc) that lead to tangible improvements in participant engagement. Separately, we've spoken with many of the larger CROs/vendors in the space (IQVIA, Veeva, etc) who could theoretically build a patient payments solution but would rather work with a partner like Mural. Patient payments is a large enough market today for Mural to build a big business, but specific/nuanced enough that the IQVIA won’t invest the time and resources to build an integrated payment experience.
