## Slide 3

Cytokinetics is looking to characterize HFpEF subtypes that would benefit from a CMI and understand physician perception of CK-274

CONTEXT

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

Cytokinetics is developing a cardiac myosin inhibitor (CMI) for use in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
There is a large unmet need in HFpEF due to a lack of novel therapeutics
The HFpEF patient population is composed of different patient subtypes with varying disease etiologies
Some patient subtypes, such as those with higher EF and / or LVH, may derive added benefit from a myosin inhibitor
Cytokinetics would like to understand the epidemiology, characterization, and the commercial opportunity across these patient subtypes

Bionest’s research addresses 4 key objectives:
Understand how physicians currently characterize, class, and diagnose HFpEF patient subtypes, including those with hypercontractility and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
Estimate size of the patient pool for these patient subtypes
Evaluate the perception of different CK-274 clinical profiles in these patient subtypes and estimate anticipated prescription rates
Qualitatively assess the competitive landscape of HFpEF treatments in development to gain directional insights on their impact on CK-274 adoption

Note: Glossary of acronyms can be found in deck Appendix

## Slide 6

Executive Summary (1/3)

Increasing perceived value

KOL Perceptions of CK-274 TPPs

KOLs have unique segmentation algorithms that they use for their HFpEF patients today (varies by physician)
The three most mentioned segments are RV disease, obesity, and AF
Almost all patients fall into 2 or more of these categories

Overall, Cytokinetics’ subgroups of interest are estimated to represent ~40% of the HFpEF population

KOL Segmentation Practices

Of the standalone TPPs, KOLs prefer the hospitalizations / mortality TPP
Cardiologists prefer the “hard endpoints” and see a large unmet need associated with prolonging life and reducing hospital admissions

Of the standalone TPPs, KOLs rank exercise / QoL second, but these endpoints would not limit expected prescription
QoL is the most important factor for patients, but KOLs believe community physicians may not be as receptive to QoL / symptoms data

Although KOLs do not currently segment into EF-based groups, adoption of this segmentation should not represent a barrier
However, exercise EF is not commonly measured and will be difficult to integrate in routine clinical practice

Unprompted Segments

Prompted Segments

When disease modification is presented as an add-on profile to hospitalizations / mortality or exercise / QoL, KOL perception of CK-274 further improves
This data gives KOLs greater confidence in the drug and its stated effects

---

## Slide 7

Executive Summary (2/3)

CK-274 Alone

Competitive Analysis

Before analyzing the competition, KOLs identified how they would prescribe CK-274 if it were the only drug available today. 
3 user types were identified:

Early Adopters

Add-on Users

Skeptics

Increasing time to market

SGLT2i on market

SGLT2i + mavacamten
on market

SGLT2i + mavacamten + CK-274 on market

Early adopters want to use CK-274 in most eligible HFpEF patients
Foresee use in 80%+ of eligible patients; share would not vary across segments

Add-on users would prescribe in patients who are symptomatic after co-morbidity management
Foresee use in ~40% of eligible patients; share would not vary across segments

Skeptics would only prescribe in patients with hypercontractility or LVH
Foresee use in ~30% of these patients

SGLT2i will be prescribed in ~75% of HFpEF patients. Only those with severe renal disease or side effects like UTIs will not receive SGLT2is

CMIs are predicted to achieve ~20% of the HFpEF market based on defined indication and physician usage expectations
12% will be from SGLT2i co-prescription and 5%+ from CMI-only prescription
Due to safety concerns (e.g., misdosing associated with half-life), mavacamten is anticipated to only capture ~40% of the possible CMI market even if it is the only CMI available

As CK-274 is strongly preferred over mavacamten, once it is available, KOLs anticipate using CK-274 in patients ineligible for mavacamten and nearly all CMI-naïve patients
Thus, at peak CK-274 is anticipated to capture 80%+ of the CMI market share described above, or ~17% of HFpEF patients
However, uptake may be delayed as cardiologists will not switch patients from mavacamten to CK-274

## Slide 8

Executive Summary (3/3)

$12,000 MAX price

$8,400 
RESTRICTION THRESHOLD

$6,000 EXPECTED price

$0 Annually

$25,000 Annually

As long as CK-274 is priced under $8,400 annually, restrictions are not expected 
Interviewed payers require prior authorization if a drug is priced above $700/month ($8,400 / yr)
Payers suggest staying under the $8,400 threshold regardless of the patient population size

Pricing Considerations: CK-274 Alone

Pricing Considerations: CK-274 Competition

SGLT2i + CK-274

ERA + CK-274

Mavacamten + CK-274

ERAs are not expected to impact CK-274 coverage decisions

SGLT2i are not expected to impact CK-274 coverage decisions UNLESS CK-274 requires prior authorization
In this case, SGLT2i will likely be a mandatory step pre-CK-274
Combination use with CK-274 is not expected to be an issue as long as CK-274 is priced under $8,400 annually

As a direct competitor, mavacamten will impact access for CK-274
It is possible that the less expensive CMI will be a mandatory step before prescription of the other

## Slide 10

Although KOLs do not currently use hypercontractility or LVH in their segmentation practices, these phenotypes can easily be identified

Hypercontractility

LVH

EF >70-75%

Echocardiogram

Medium
While KOLs can define hypercontractility, no definition or criteria is established

Septal wall thickness >12mm or Mass Index >95g (female) or >115g (male)

ECG
Echocardiogram

High
LVH is well defined in the literature, has clear criteria, and is easily identifiable by KOLs

All KOLs currently segment their HFpEF patients; however, segmentation practices are highly variable by physician
KOLs segment by co-morbidity because no HFpEF drugs exist; management is focused on co-morbidities

Increasing mentions

Obesity / metabolic disease

Atrial fibrillation and LA myopathy

CAD / coronary microvascular dysfunction

RV disease / pulmonary hypertension

Chronotropic incompetence

LV dysfunction / diastolic dysfunction

Uncontrolled hypertension

Unprompted Segmentation

Prompted Segmentation

KOLs do not currently segment patients based on LVH and contractility, as there are no treatments that differ based on these segments 
However, they can easily define and describe these subgroups, and would be readily able to adopt segmentation practices in the future if needed to prescribe a novel drug

## Slide 11

HFpEF patients tend to have multiple co-morbidities and therefore do not fall into mutually exclusive segments

Obesity / Metabolic Disease

Atrial Fibrillation and LA Myopathy

RV Disease / Pulmonary Hypertension

40-50%

% of HFpEF patients with 1+2

% of HFpEF patients with 2+3

% of HFpEF patients with all

KOLs indicate each of these three groups is NOT distinct; almost all HFpEF patients fall into two or more of these categories
LVH is a common structural abnormality of the heart, and therefore can be commonly found in all three of the segments above
Hypercontractility (EF >75%) is uncommon and does not typically overlap with any of the three segments above
However, of the three, obese patients are the most likely to have hypercontractility

Note: KOLs often pushed back on this concept of segmentation. Asking KOLs to define or quantify provided segments was met by resistance. All KOLs indicate there is no standard way to segment HFpEF patients in the cardiology community

Source: KOL Cardiologist Interviews (n=14 interviews), and Bionest Partners

KOLs note that HFpEF patients with 1+3 is uncommon

## Slide 12

Cytokinetics’ defined segments represent a sizeable portion of the HFpEF population based on literature and KOL input

Row 1 values above were typically consistent between literature and KOL input; where any discrepancy did exist, the literature value was favored in this analysis
KOL input alone was used to inform the exercise EF category (as reliable literature values are not available) as well as the number of patients who meet the exclusion criteria specified in the TPP

To determine the size of Cytokinetics’ 4 subgroups of interest, Bionest leveraged 3 data sources: epidemiological and registry studies of LVH (Slide 13), literature values for ejection fraction (Slide 14), and KOL interviews (Slide 15)

## Slide 13

Based on literature, LVH is present in ~50% of HFpEF patients across geographies

Based on literature, of patients with HFpEF, what percent have LVH?*

*Appendix includes detailed information on studies used in this analysis

On average and across geographies, LVH accounts for ~50% of HFpEF patients
In a pan-EU study, rates of LVH were found to be 48.2% amongst those with HFpEF
Differences across studies may be attributable to race / ethnic differences, lifestyle, or socioeconomic factors
For example, in a predominantly white US study, LVH was 42%, while in an African-American only US cohort, LVH was 75%
LVH is also heavily tied to hypertension, so factors that impact hypertension by geography can also impact rates of LVH

42-75% LVH, of that:
26-73% CH
2-16% EH

12% LVH

48.5% LVH

17.4% LVH

No DE-specific data

## Slide 14

US Data Only

Hypercontractility is a relatively rare feature of HFpEF based on epidemiological studies

Source: Circ Heart Fail. 2012 (5), 720-6; and Bionest Partners

~4% of patients with HFpEF have hypercontractility (EF >75%)
Hypercontractility in HFpEF is not a predominant field of study, and epidemiological / registry studies are lacking across geographies
However, one study in Olmsted MN looked at EF levels across HFpEF types, finding:
The majority of HFpEF patients have EF <65%
EF is higher, on average, among patients who are female, elderly, or have a  small LV end diastolic diameter
EF decreases an average of 5.5% over 5 years, with greater decline associated with worse prognosis

Based on literature, of patients with HFpEF, what percent have hypercontractility?

## Slide 15

According to KOLs, the four subgroups of interest represent a majority of the HFpEF population before applying exclusion criteria

3 / 4 subgroups of interest are easy to identify and could be readily integrated in normal practice: EF >55% with LVH, EF 65-75%, and resting EF >75%
Exercise EF >75% is more difficult to identify, as exercise echos are not routine
Only 10 / 14 KOLs were able to estimate the size of the exercise EF segment
Most exercise testing is only done for ischemia currently
HFA scores out of Europe recommend that patients with an intermediate probability of HFpEF (score of 2-4) receive an exercise echo; if adopted in the US, exercise echo will likely be limited to academic settings in the short-term

Note: for the calculation of Net %, the mid-points of the included and excluded ranges were used

Primary market research with KOLs explored: what percent of HFpEF patients fall into each of these 4 categories (categories are not mutually exclusive)? How many patients would be excluded based on these exclusion criteria: infiltrative cardiomyopathy, abnormal contractility / absolute global strain, and failure to augment with exercise?

Source: KOL Cardiologist Interviews (n=14 interviews), and Bionest Partners

---

## Slide 16

Cytokinetics’ four subgroups of interest are not mutually exclusive; however, their exact overlap is difficult to ascertain based on existing data

Exercise EF >75%

Resting EF 65-75%

Resting EF >55% with LVH

Resting EF >75%

According to the literature, ~50% of HFpEF patients have LVH
Assuming equal distribution of LVH across EFs, approx. half of resting EF 65-75% and resting EF >75% is contained within the resting EF >55% with LVH group
However, rates of LVH may vary with ejection fraction, so additional medical studies would be helpful to understand the exact intersection 
The intersection of the exercise EF >75% with the other 3 groups could not be characterized
Literature data about the range of exercise EF values for a given resting EF could not be found
KOLs often did not perform exercise testing and therefore did not know the size or makeup of this segment
As a result, exercise EF could theoretically intersect with any and all of other three segments, but exactly how is unknown at this time
However, resting EF >75% is expected to be fully contained within exercise EF >75% as patients who failed to augment with exercise were excluded from this analysis

Note: Sizes of bubbles correlate to segment sizes

Qualitatively, the four subgroups of interest for Cytokinetics overlap heavily

## Slide 18

Cardiologists are enthusiastic about CK-274 and its potential impact on HFpEF patient management

Most cardiologists will prescribe across mentioned subgroups; however, certain subgroups are more likely to see stated benefits than others:
Patients with LVH will likely benefit more due to the changes in LV EDV and LAV that can mitigate the cardiac structural abnormalities of LVH
Patients in the two EF >75% groups are likely to benefit more due to greatest potential change in EF / contractility

KOLs were presented with 2 complete CK-274 Product Profiles + add-on data for disease modification (complete TPPs in appendix)

## Slide 19

Hospitalizations & Mortality TPP has “hard endpoints” that would be well-received and well-understood across the entire HFpEF community

Primary endpoint is perceived as robust by the majority of KOLs; however, the effect size is the minimum they are willing to accept
This endpoint is expected to resonate with the highest number of cardiologists, including in the community, as it is considered a “hard endpoint”

The effect size stated will likely be difficult to achieve without further narrowing the patient population
Most mortality and morbidity in HFpEF is driven by co-morbidities, which are not impacted by CK-274, so the primary endpoints may be difficult to achieve

Decreasing hospitalizations is very significant to KOLs
Hospitalizations are a driver of reduced QoL, and avoiding them would improve patient experience
KOLs are glad that other markers of QoL, such as NYHA and KCCQ, are still being assessed

The NYHA and KCCQ endpoints have smaller effect sizes than those in the exercise / QoL profile; KOLs find these underwhelming in comparison

This TPP is ranked first by most KOLs, as the endpoints are seen as clinically significant and widely acceptable
Cardiologists look to increasing length of life and reducing hospitalizations as a barometer of effectiveness

## Slide 20

Endpoints assessed in the Functional Capacity & QoL TPP are highly valuable, but there may be pushback at the community level

Primary Endpoint

Peak VO2 is an objective endpoint that is a barometer of overall health / fitness
2 mL / kg / min is a sizeable and significant effect size

Peak VO2-based HFpEF studies may be difficult to conduct because:
Many centers do not have necessary equipment or expertise
Patients dislike participating 
Testing requires younger and healthier patients to participate
A change in peak VO2 does not necessarily mean a patient will feel better

Secondary Endpoint

Secondary endpoints have robust effect sizes
Cardiologists like that the 6MWD and KCCQ demonstrate definite improvement in patient QoL
KCCQ is generally perceived as the better measure between the two, as it is patient-centric

Cardiologist response to the change in LV EDV is mixed
Most KOLs say that this will have a positive effect in these HFpEF groups
However, increasing LV EDV goes against practices in HFrEF, and echo changes may not directly indicate improved QoL; may lead to confusion / pushback in the community
NYHA is a highly subjective measure

KOLs rank the exercise, functional capacity, QoL and symptoms TPP a close second
QoL is the number one most important factor to patients; a lack of ways to improve QoL in HFpEF is one of the greatest unmet needs at this time
Exercise and QoL endpoints may not resonate with community cardiologists who are less familiar with endpoints such as Peak VO2 or change in LV EDV

## Slide 21

Disease modification can have significant value when it is added onto existing data showing changes in symptoms and / or mortality

Standalone Profile

Over the course of the research, 2 profiles for disease modification were tested: a standalone profile in Wave 1, and an add-on profile to hospitalizations / mortality and exercise / QoL in Wave 2

Add-on Profile

Overall Impression

Comfort with Endpoints

Perceived Impact

KOLs are concerned that there is insufficient knowledge about natural disease progression in HFpEF 
They are unsure what disease modification means
They do not know what measures signify disease modification or prevention today

Disease modification without an associated improvement in QoL or mortality / hospitalizations is seen as less valuable 
Disease modification alone is unimportant to patients, and is therefore likely to dampen prescription by KOLs

When disease modification data is added to other data, cardiologists become more excited about CK-274
Structural changes to the heart explain exercise / QoL and hospitalizations / mortality improvements
Understanding changes to the heart make KOLs more comfortable with the MoA of the drug

Disease modification data may increase prescription share, especially in the LVH groups where wall thickness is addressed
Disease modification will act as a stand-out factor in a future market with many drugs

Not enthusiastic

Adds value to either hospitalizations or QoL profile

Source: KOL Cardiologist Interviews (n=14 interviews), and Bionest Partners

---

## Slide 22

The disease modification endpoints provide KOLs greater confidence in the stated effects of the drug

Cardiologists believe that the endpoints of interest will be sufficient to show disease modification
Decreasing wall thickness shows disease improvement, especially in patients with LVH
Decreasing NT-proBNP is good for long term prognosis
Disease modification is considered to be an objective measure of improvement and increases trust in the product
If changes in fibrosis could be shown, CK-274 would be the first to do so

Measuring a change in wall thickness of only 15% will likely be inaccurate and difficult to do
The change in NT-proBNP is small compared to other trials in HFrEF
KOLs emphasize that NT-proBNP needs a larger and more sustained effect 
These parameters are complex and may only be appreciated by academic cardiologists
In the community, these parameters are unlikely to impact clinical decision-making, as they are not patient-centered

## Slide 25

Among the competitive drugs, cardiologists are most enthusiastic about SGLT2i

SGLT2i

ERA

Mavacamten

Many HFpEF patients are on beta blockers and / or calcium channel blockers (up to 70-80%), and there is no agreed upon safe way to take patients off these drugs
KOLs hesitant to prescribe this drug
Smaller Tx index and longer half-life represents a high risk of toxicity

CK-274 Preferred over Mavacamten

Not Competitive with CK-274*

Can be used Together with CK-274

The large change in NT-proBNP is considered to be favorable

CONS

Medication could provide positive effects in patients with PH or RV dysfunction
If stated endpoints are met, physicians likely to use

PROS

Liver dysfunction can be common in these patients, so dosing may be difficult
Narrow entry criteria means that limited HFpEF patients will benefit

CONS

Broad indication could benefit most patients
Anecdotal and trial data suggests SGLT2i can improve QoL and reduce hospitalizations
Manages both HFpEF and co-morbidities
Diabetics make up a large portion of the HFpEF population

PROS

Patient populations for ERAs are likely to be non-overlapping with other drugs in development

NEUTRAL

Renal toxicity is a concern and would exclude patients with <30 eGFR
Patients in trials report severe UTIs as a side effect
~10% of HFrEF patients who take the drug can get hypotension

CONS

PROS

*As they were considered non-competitive, ERAs were excluded from market share analysis

## Slide 26

SGLT2i are expected to become the new standard of care in HFpEF and will be prescribed to the majority (75%) of HFpEF patients at launch

SGLT2i such as Jardiance or Farxiga are likely to enter the HFpEF market first. Due to their broad patient population and lack of competition, KOLs anticipate the SGLT2i’s patient pool to be:

KOLs anticipate that SGLT2i will become standard of care and will be used in 75% of the HFpEF population
However, at initial launch, most KOLs anticipate they will begin using SGLT2i only in the ~50% of patients with Type 2 diabetes, and then scale up to HFpEF patients without diabetes
This anticipated prescription dynamic is only true if cardiologists are the ones prescribing SGLT2i; KOLs note that PCPs may handle prescription

## Slide 28

CK-274 is strongly preferred over mavacamten and will be prescribed to the majority of CMI-naïve patients

Initial Scenario: Mavacamten comes to market with SGLT2i

Subsequent Scenario: CK-274 arrives on market

At launch, KOLs anticipate mavacamten’s patient pool to be:

-25% on contraindicated medications

-50% HCP not comfortable to prescribe

Of the total CMI market, mavacamten is expected to capture ~38%, largely due to concerns about the safety profile
KOLs are concerned about the long half life and narrow Tx index, which can result in toxicity
They are especially worried about older patients who may improperly dose
As a result, KOLs would only prescribe the drug in patients who are symptomatic and those who they expect to properly dose themselves

Due to concerns about toxicity and dosing, KOLs prefer CK-274. Once CK-274 launches, KOLs will begin prescribing in:

Most newly diagnosed patients

The ~25% of CMI-eligible patients that are ineligible for mavacamten due to contraindicated medication

The ~12% of HFpEF patients that have EF 55-60% and LVH

However, KOLs anticipate that they will rarely, if ever, switch a patient from mavacamten to CK-274 and will not use both drugs together
Therefore, all patients who are taking mavacamten at the time of CK-274 launch are anticipated to remain on mavacamten 
Over time, due to preference for CK-274, KOLs will begin using CK-274 in most circumstances where a CMI is indicated

As the first CMI to market, mavacamten will initially compete directly with SGLT2i. CK-274 will enter the market subsequently

Total HFpEF market share at time of CK-274 peak

SGLT2is will be prescribed in the majority of patients as they have a broad indication and are generally well tolerated

Mavacamten has the advantage of being the first CMI on the market and getting early uptake
At mavacamten’s peak, it is expected to capture 38% of the CMI-eligible market
This share is expected to decline as CK-274 comes to market, as it is preferred in new patients

Once CK-274 arrives on market, cardiologists anticipate they will choose CK-274 over mavacamten due to concerns about safety and contraindications
At peak, CK-274 is anticipated to capture 80%+ of the CMI-eligible market
As some cardiologists will likely resist switching CMIs, ≤20% of the CMI market is expected to remain with mavacamten

In order to achieve the described prescription shares, the robustness of CK-274’s efficacy data must match or exceed competitors, particularly mavacamten

Source: KOL Cardiologist Interviews (n=14 interviews), and Bionest Partners

Assumption 1: Data Considered

Assumption 2: Mavacamten vs. CK-274

Two key assumptions underlie the competitive analyses shown on the previous slides

KOLs were asked to consider each TPP individually when discussing CK-274 “in a vacuum” 
They were shown the TPPs one at a time and asked to comment on these independently
However, as the competitive analysis was the last portion of discussion, KOLs had seen all CK-274 profiles
For the competitive analysis, therefore, KOLs were drawing from BOTH the hospitalizations / mortality and the exercise / QoL TPPs
Market share derived from the competitive analysis is based on the assumption that CK-274 will match or exceed competitors in the robustness of evaluated efficacy measures

KOLs were shown a slide with key differences highlighted for CK-274 and mavacamten 
These differences included the indication, therapeutic index, half-life, and contraindications
They were told that CK-274 and mavacamten do not vary in terms of hospitalizations / mortality or exercise / QoL endpoints
All assumptions about CK-274 and mavacamten competition are based on both products having similar efficacy data
KOLs were clear that if either CK-274 or mavacamten had more / less or better / worse data, this would likely change their prescription dynamics
As a result, CK-274 trials should closely mirror the design and data generation of mavacamten trials to achieve the stated prescription shares

## Slide 32

Due to a lack of targeted therapies within HF, payers generally do not specify or consider subtypes of HF

Segmentation and Tracking Today

Drivers of Cost Today

Currently, payers do not differentiate between subtypes of HF
As current drug labeling does not require segmentation, they do not regularly track this
If drugs for HFpEF or other subtypes of HF come to market, payers believe they would begin tracking segments
However, they would need to ensure appropriate coding to do this effectively

Payers recognize echocardiograms as a standard protocol for the identification and monitoring of HF patients
If a drug were to come to market that required echo to identify or dose patients, this would not be an issue
If a drug requires a prior authorization, payers will fund testing that ensures the correct patient receives an expensive drug

The current cost of heart failure is driven by hospitalizations
Drugs do not represent a large burden in HF as the market is heavily genericized
Even with branded drugs coming to market, payers do not anticipate the main drivers of cost to shift
To payers, the biggest unmet needs in HF are high mortality and a lack of curative products

## Slide 33

Overall, payers prefer the hospitalizations and mortality TPP, as it addresses their largest concerns in HF today

Payers think these endpoints are less attractive than hospitalizations
Payers think that these endpoints are subjective
Payers do not see value in KCCQ 
Payers worry Peak VO2 will not translate to a functional improvement in daily living

Payers do not think disease modification makes the exercise & QoL profile much more convincing
Payers require evidence that shows NT-proBNP is a “gold standard” biomarker

Payers need more info about what disease modification is and how it is measured

Payers like this profile the most as it shows change in CV death and hospitalizations
Payers think this profile best shows disease modification

Exercise & QoL

Exercise & QoL + disease mod.

Hospitalizations & mortality TPP

Payers prefer the hospitalizations and mortality TPP and believe that this data is key to optimizing access, particularly if faced with competing products
Payers need more education about the MoA and why the specific patient populations were chosen
Across all endpoints and profiles, payers felt that the effect sizes shown were too small

PROS

CONS

NEUTRAL

Payers prefer NYHA as it is a more “traditional” endpoint and 6MWD because it shows a tangible change in functional capacity

Payers like that these endpoints are objective and easy to measure compared to more “subjective” exercise & QoL endpoints

PROS

CONS

Payers would prefer if the endpoints were not composite

Payers would also like information about: 
Re-hospitalizations
Level of care needed when hospitalized
Average length of hospitalization

## Slide 34

Payers can reasonably see CK-274 being priced up to $12,000 annually; however, above $8,400 annually, CK-274 will likely be restricted

Payers emphasize that if priced less than $700 per month ($8,400 annually), CK-274 will likely not face restrictions associated with the specialty tier and can be prescribed more freely in HFpEF patients 
However, if CK-274 is priced above this, it will likely require prior authorization and step therapy, with other SOC products prescribed first
In order for CK-274 to realistically be priced at $25,000 or above, payers say that it would need to demonstrate larger effect sizes (25%+)
Payers’ opinions on pricing and restrictions do not vary by TPP or by population size; they recommend pricing below the $8,400 threshold regardless

$6,000 / year

$12,000 / year

$25,000 / year

$50,000 / year

$100,000 / year

Of the 5 prices tested, payers believe $6,000 is a reasonable price, with $12,000 being the maximum acceptable price

Payer Additional Considerations

KOL Additional Considerations

Payers felt they needed additional information to make a firm judgement on the pricing / restrictions, such as:
Detailed side effects
Dosages
Adherence
Co-use / contraindications with other HF medications
Length of effect experienced by patient

Even though KOLs were not given price information to consider, many KOLs brought up price concerns unprompted during interviews
KOLs emphasize that their patients are sensitive to price, as many are on Medicare and cannot afford expensive medications
Patients can have as much as 30% co-insurance
If price is very high, anticipated prescription share of CK-274 will decrease if patients cannot reasonably afford it

## Slide 35

While ERAs and SGLT2i will have a low impact on CK-274 coverage, two CMIs on the market may result in step therapy for one or the other

Increasing potential impact on CK-274 pricing & reimbursement

ERA

Will not impact CK-274 as ERAs are non-competing & non-overlapping
Pricing & reimbursement decisions on ERAs will not impact CK-274 
ERAs are reimbursed at high prices, as PH is a very deadly disease, and patients often do not receive any one medication for long
Due to high cost, ERAs are highly restricted via mechanisms such as prior authorization and step therapy

SGLT2i

Will not impact CK-274 unless CK-274 is restricted
If CK-274 is restricted, SGLT2i would likely be a required step before CK-274 prescription
However, if CK-274 is also unrestricted, SGLT2i will not impact access
Payers do not believe combination use with CK-274 will be an issue
SGLT2is are not restricted, and by the time CK-274 comes to market, SGLT2is will be generic
Combination is generally only considered an issue if two high cost (specialty tier) drugs are used together

Mavacamten

Mavacamten will be considered a competitor product as it has the same MoA
Impact on CK-274 access varies:
If mavacamten is less expensive and equally or more efficacious, payers may require step therapy of mavacamten pre-CK-274
If CK-274 is less expensive and equally or more efficacious, payers may require step therapy of CK-274  pre-mavacamten
If the drugs are of similar price and efficacy, the choice will be left to physician discretion

Source: National Payer Interviews (n=2 interviews), and Bionest Partners

This competitive analysis assumes CK-274 has hospitalizations / mortality data. If CK-274 does not have this data and mavacamten or an SGLT2i does, this may increase the likelihood that CK-274 is restricted (e.g., product with stronger efficacy data is a necessary step prior to prescription of CK-274)

## Slide 37

Conclusions and Recommendations

Bionest does not recommend pursuing one HFpEF subgroup described in the TPP over the others; there is limited benefit associated with pursuing a narrower patient population (e.g., EF>75%) vs. a broader HFpEF population
KOLs generally don’t expect prescription share to vary across the 4 subtypes (although prescription in exercise EF>75% category will likely be low due to difficulty identifying patients)
Payers do not believe a narrower patient population will justify a higher price than the $12,000 cap, and do not recommend exceeding $8,400 due to associated restrictions
It will be important that CK-274 data is in line with competitor data to maximize HCP uptake and payer acceptance
QoL and symptoms data is sufficient to drive prescription share among KOLs, but community HCPs and payers may be less receptive to a product that does not demonstrate improvement in hospitalizations / mortality; additional research with payers and community prescribing physicians is recommended
Additionally, if other HFpEF drugs, especially mavacamten, have more robust data, it may negatively impact willingness to prescribe CK-274; for example SGLT2is are being investigated in Phase III trials for hospitalizations / mortality and exercise / QoL
Competitive positioning of CK-274 will be critical as SGLT2is and mavacamten come to market
For SGLT2i, it will be critical that physicians are comfortable co-prescribing CK-274; data to show co-prescription is safe and beneficial to patients would likely strengthen the position of CK-274 in the market
For mavacamten, Cytokinetics should emphasize benefits of CK-274 (e.g., lack of contraindications, reduced half-life, etc.) to maximize CK-274 use in CMI-naïve patients

## Slide 45

While HFpEF shows consistent overall prevalence across geographies, certain aspects of epidemiology can vary by ethnicity and region

~50% of HF patients worldwide have HFpEF
Rates of HFpEF have been shown to be between 40 and 70% in studies
Studies use varying cutoffs to define HFpEF (>40%, >45%, >50%, or >55%), making the exact epidemiology of HFpEF by country difficult to define

Studies across geographies indicate that age is the most important risk factor for HFpEF
China: Prevalence of HFpEF is 4.8% in those 65+
Italy: Prevalence of HFpEF is 4.9% in those 65-84
Olmstead County, US: Prevalence of HFpEF 13% in those 75+
UK ECHOES: Prevalence of HFpEF 17% in those 85+

Overall HFpEF Epidemiology

Geographic Similarities

There are distinct differences between Western and East Asian HFpEF patients
As compared to Western / Caucasian populations, Asian HFpEF patients:
Appear to be almost a decade younger
Have a high prevalence of co-morbidities (especially CKD, diabetes, and hypertension) for their age
Have higher rates of LVH but lower rates of CH

## Slide 46

Across geographies, HFpEF guideline recommendations are fairly uniform; none recommend segmentation

Definitions, diagnostic protocols, and biomarkers tend to be consistent across geographies with only minor country-specific differences
All countries except Japan explicitly mention LVH as either a HFpEF diagnostic criteria or a feature to be examined on an echo
No countries suggest classifying patients based on levels of EF

## Slide 47

Though hypercontractility in HFpEF is not clearly defined in literature, KOLs identify it as high EF

Contractility is the ability of the heart to generate force and shorten 
It can be altered by: changing the amount of calcium, the affinity of myofilaments for calcium, or the amount of myofilaments

## Slide 48

LVH is a common structural abnormality in HFpEF, especially among co-morbid patient populations

LVH is an increase in left ventricular myocardial mass
LVH stabilizes LV function when mechanical load increases (e.g., hypertension)
Most common structural cardiac abnormality in HFpEF

Definition

There are 2 types of LVH that vary by heart geometry: CH and EH

Concentric Hypertrophy

Eccentric Hypertrophy

Increased LV wall thickness
Normal LV cavity size
Increased LV mass
Increased relative wall thickness

All cardiologists identify the lack of effective therapies as the largest unmet need facing HFpEF patients today

High Need

Low Need

Cardiologists perceive a significant unmet need in HFpEF today
The vast majority of that need is related to the lack of effective therapeutic options
Cardiologists are “desperate” for any advancement in therapies
However, KOLs recognize that without better segmentation, it’s unlikely that drugs will be approved
Further limiting factors are related to the doctor’s ability to diagnose, treat, and manage symptoms with today’s tools
Improving the application of current Dx and Tx methods is a possibility for near-term advancements in patient care

Background information about heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction and subgroups of interest

Heart failure patients are often classified into 3 groups: heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with a mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF)
These groups vary in how much blood is ejected from the heart with each beat. Patients with HFpEF pump out ≥50% of the blood in their left ventricles with every beat (i.e., HFpEF patients have an ejection fraction of ≥50%)
HFpEF is characterized by impaired relaxation and a stiffened heart
HFpEF is the most common form of heart failure, representing ~50% of all heart failure patients

We will be discussing HFpEF sub-populations during our interview (these populations are not mutually exclusive). The 4 sub-populations and their relative size are:

Heart failure patients with an ejection fraction ≥75% at rest
This represents ~5% of HFpEF patients based on literature

Heart failure patients with an ejection fraction 65-75% at rest
This represents ~30% of HFpEF patients based on literature

Heart failure patients with an ejection fraction ≥75% at rest who also have left ventricular hypertrophy
This represents ~40% of HFpEF patients based on literature
Left ventricular hypertrophy is the enlargement or thickening of the walls of the heart

Heart failure patients with an ejection fraction ≥75% while exercising
This represents ~15% of HFpEF patients
Measuring ejection fraction during exercising is not common in clinical practice

---

## Slide 77

Background information about the different endpoints that we will be exploring in our discussion

Peak VO2
This is the maximum volume of oxygen that the body can uptake
VO2 increases as a patient exercises, but eventually reaches a maximum (a “peak”) whereby even with increasing exercise effort, the VO2 does not increase
High Peak VO2 is associated with increased cardiac output, skeletal muscle blood flow, and exercise tolerance

New York Heart Association Class
This is a classification system for heart failure
Class 1: No limitations to physical activity
Class 2: Slight limitations to physical activity
Class 3: Marked limitation of activity. Activity causes fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea
Class 4: Unable to carry out physical activity without discomfort

Left Ventricular End Diastolic Volume
Amount of blood in the heart’s left ventricle before it contracts
A decreased left ventricular end diastolic volume means that even at high ejection fraction, minimal blood is pumped out from the heart with each beat

Left Atrial Volume
Amount of blood in the heart’s left atrium when the heart relaxes
If the left ventricular end diastolic volume is decreased, then there will be higher pressure in the left atrium
Over time, this high pressure causes the left atrium to enlarge

6-minute Walk Distance
Distance that a patient can walk in 6 minutes
This test is a good assessment of functional capacity and is a predictor of all cause mortality in long term follow up for patients with heart failure

Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire
This is a 23-question, self-administered questionnaire that assesses physical function, symptoms, social function, self-efficacy, and quality of life

NT-proBNP
NT-proBNP is a biomarker that is produced by your heart in response to pressure changes
Levels go up when heart failure develops or gets worse and levels go down when heart failure is stable or improves

Drug X is a cardiac myosin inhibitor indicated to improve exercise and quality of life, reduce hospitalizations and mortality, and modify or slow disease in heart failure patients with a resting ejection fraction >75%, a resting ejection fraction 65-75%, a resting ejection >55% and left ventricular hypertrophy, or an exercise ejection fraction >75%
No contraindications for use with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers
Half life in humans 1.5-3 days
Therapeutic Index <7
NT-proBNP reduction by 15%

Drug A is a cardiac myosin inhibitor indicated to improve exercise and quality of life, reduce hospitalizations and mortality, and modify or slow disease in heart failure patients with a resting ejection fraction  >60%
Concomitant use with both beta blockers and calcium channel blockers contraindicated; however, use with either beta blockers or calcium channel blockers is acceptable
Half-life in humans ~8 days
Therapeutic Index of <3
Reduction in NT-proBNP by 50%

For the purposes of this discussion, you can assume that Drug X and Drug A have the same mode of action, and would have similar reductions in hospitalization for HF and CV death, change from baseline in KCCQ total symptoms score, Peak VO2, and improvements to NYHA score

Drug Y is an endothelin receptor antagonist indicated to improve outcomes and worsening heart failure in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction >40% and pulmonary vascular disease or right ventricular dysfunction
Primary outcome: Change in NT-proBNP
Secondary endpoints: change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score, change in accelerometer-assessed physical activity, time to worsening heart failure event
Can cause hepatotoxicity and liver failure
Oral dose once daily

Drug Z is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor indicated to reduce cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction >40% and preserved systolic function
Primary outcome: time to first occurrence of any components of this composite: cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, or urgent heart failure visit
Secondary endpoint: change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score, proportion with worsened New York Heart Association class
Avoid use in patients with Type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, or on dialysis; contraindicated for patients with end state renal disease
Improves glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes
Can cause hypotension
Oral dose once daily
