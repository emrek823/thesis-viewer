# Physician Enablement: The Second Inning

Today, we are updating our thesis on the physician enablement sector. As you will read, we remain particularly excited about the ability for physicians, other providers and companies enabling those physicians, to reap the benefits of creating value against a mostly FFS healthcare system. We continue to believe that the next era of healthcare will be defined by the trend of physician enablement whereby companies will be able to benefit from the value created through risk based contracts. In this report:

*   We update our thesis to account for the changes in the market over the past year-plus, which leads to our belief that there is significant opportunity for investment in this segment. We simply don’t believe the current organization of the US healthcare system is optimized and believe that physician enablement companies will lead a significant shift in the delivery care, ultimately capturing some of the value created.
*   We present a series of supporting observations to that bullish thesis.
*   Call out CVS’ strategic pivot to physician enablement as a specific positive catalyst for the entirety of the group. We review the company’s strategic goals, competitive advantages, rationale for the impact of their decision(s), and ultimately opine on what we believe makes the most sense.
*   Review a series of potential threats to our bullish thesis.
*   Present a financial model to assist in the valuation of these companies and a comprehensive view on the current market. We continue to eschew revenue based multiples and instead walk through valuation metrics based on membership, providers and ultimately mature margin projections.
*   Update our market model which sizes the total addressable market by segment, where we estimate a total physician enablement market opportunity of $2.1 trillion today, growing at 7.5% annually to arrive at $3.7 trillion by 2030.
*   Conduct a competitive landscape analysis, where we review financial metrics for all of the public companies. We also included company summaries of 28 private companies that provide overviews, key management and fundraising information.
*   In our appendix, we again define physician enablement and explain the factors that are leading to significant growth, including the motivations for payors to push this forward, as well as the financial incentives for the primary care physician. We then review the characteristics of the primary care physician marketplace.

**TL;DR:** We will continue to highlight the physician enablement industry as we expect it will prove to be an important segment of the investable healthcare landscape providing opportunities for both public and private investors.

## Introduction

Let’s face it, healthcare in the US is not optimally structured. The idea that large insurance companies should be responsible for the management or even the coordination of health simply isn’t intuitive. Those insurers have had decades to prove their ability to better control costs and improve outcomes. Country based comparisons would suggest those attempts have been abject failures with the added sting of bottom decile customer satisfaction. Underneath the flawed construct of our healthcare system is a payment mechanism of “fee-for-service” that rewards utilization and inputs over outcomes and value. As Cano Health CEO Dr. Hernandez was recently quoted, “Today, healthcare is incredibly misaligned. The sicker the patient is, the more profitable he or she is to the institution. And that’s just, unacceptable." We understand the plethora of contributing factors in the past, but currently there is a strong likelihood the country is moving in a new direction.

Over the next decade we believe that many health insurers will simply become financing mechanisms for the delivery of healthcare (think life insurers), moving out of the way for physician enablement companies to manage the actual health of Americans. That is not to say that the current payors, which have amassed significant power in the healthcare channel, can’t evolve to lead that change alongside their insurance operations. But this is about a movement toward the responsibility of care for patients moving closer to the providers of that care.

We see the management of health, with the physician at the center, as leading to the holy grail of healthcare: better outcomes, lower costs and higher patient/provider satisfaction. This is a movement we define less by structure (i.e. clinic vs health insurance vs tech centric models) and more by process, with value created by providing physicians with the tools necessary to adopt and manage risk. While the market demonstrates skepticism and confusion for this sector, we believe that the companies empowering physician enablement present an investment opportunity in healthcare services not seen in decades. We highlight that true physician enablement speaks to the ability to better manage the cost side of the equation. Private Equity firms have historically been attracted to areas of healthcare where reimbursement maximization can be effective. Revenue enhancement is a short term phenomenon to take advantage of loopholes in reimbursement. Physician enablement is the opposite, a focus on the cost side of the equation.

Just as important, we want the reader to understand what this is not. The movement toward physician enablement is not just “value based care” and certainly not an evolution of consumerism.

Value based care connotes an evolution of the current system to improve outcomes and save money. While certainly admirable, and perhaps even necessary, that stops short of the conversation in this report. True physician enablement works to allow providers to care for patients in a wholistic and coordinated manner, consistently applying the best care protocols. With a better system in place, improved outcomes are almost a given. And with improved outcomes comes lower costs. We see the system as the most important facet of physician enablement, with the outcomes and costs as the benefits. We enjoyed a quote from a piece written by Michael Millenson where he notes “ “Value” care sounds like the medical equivalent of a meal at Taco Bell. (Also, if your child falls sick, do you want “best care” or “best value for the money”?) “Accountable” care has overtones of treatment decisions made by CPAs. And a “medical home” is where Mom says she’d rather die than go to.”

Similarly, this is not a “new tech” sector that will “solve” the problems of the healthcare industry. It simply doesn’t work like that. Healthcare is different. Technology will be a tool, perhaps even the enabling tool, but not the solution. When you run out of sugar and need a cup for a recipe at home, there are literally dozens of immediate solutions available, many enabled by technology. You can go to the supermarket, or many other retail outlets, find the item and self-checkout all without any human interaction. If you have more time, you order through amazon or various other options and get it as soon as the same day. If that doesn’t work, you can even ring the neighbor’s doorbell and ask to borrow some sugar. Healthcare is different. The delivery of healthcare cannot be displaced entirely by technology. While there are certainly many facets of care delivery that can be addressed remotely, there is very little beyond the lowest level of acuity that can be solved without a human interaction, and that interaction likely needs a specialized type of labor. Instead, the service and experience can be assisted and enhanced through technology. You simply can’t ring the neighbor’s doorbell with a healthcare emergency. Physician enablement is about technology playing a critical part in enhancing the delivery of value in the healthcare system. We view this movement as a systematic change of the support through which physicians and other healthcare professionals can practice.

As we discuss throughout this update, we see benefits accruing to Payors, Patients, Providers, and Communities (especially underserved ones). Most think of the healthcare ecosystem functions as a zero sum game where one entities savings comes at the expense of another. We acknowledge there will be losers, most notably inefficient sites of care (and maybe McDonalds), but stress that physician enablement is about the optimization of resources. There are now 10 (or so) public companies in this space and literally dozens of companies in the private markets targeting different aspects of physician enablement.

In summary, we believe that there is a tremendous investment opportunity in the physician enablement sector and expect to see significant value creation for shareholders in the coming years. The majority of these companies will attack the market through the simple premise of collecting data from disparate sources (i.e. not just claims), synthesizing that data into useful information, using that information in a systematic approach to influence the behaviors of physicians and therefore patients, and reaping the benefits of lower cost care with better outcomes. Many companies will speak to their proprietary technology in that process, but we don’t think that is the key. We think that there are many ways to create value in the delivery of healthcare. Physician enablement is about moving the economics of value to the providers and companies that support that movement. We would go so far as suggesting that this sector has the opportunity to create more value for shareholders than any subsector we have seen in the past two decades.

## Observations Supporting our Bullish Thesis

1.  **Physician enablement when operating correctly has the power to help virtually all aspects of the healthcare ecosystem.** There are many beneficiaries of a strong ecosystem for value based care:
    *   **Payors:** We see a significant amount of benefit accruing to payors including higher customer satisfaction, stronger retention, lower overall costs, more consistent financial trends (the transfer of risk), the opportunity to access new markets in new ways, smarter benefit design, local market expertise/experience, the elimination of waste and abuse, faster growth and many other areas.
    *   **Patients:** Similarly, we believe that patients get the most important benefit which is better care! We consistently hear about longer patient visits, more frequent primary and preventive care visits, reduced medical costs, higher satisfaction and just an overall better experience all around.
    *   **Physicians:** Benefits to the physicians can also be meaningful including more time with patients (reduced administrative time), improved outcomes, clinical support and care teams, and ultimately improved compensation.
    *   **Health systems:** While sometimes considered those most at risk in a value-based care environment (has anyone cited lower bed days/1000 recently???), we think that health systems that participate in the physician enablement movement can be big winners. We point to Maine Health’s partnership with agilon, First Health with Privia, and MANY others as signs of opportunity for health systems. With a strong partner, health systems can actually take share and substitute lower acuity (lower quality) procedures with higher acuity services and ultimately more market share.
    *   **Communities (especially underserved):** agilon health did a great job at their March 2022 investor day highlighting the opportunity to raise the health and vitality of entire communities, especially underserved areas. agilon noted that 43% of their physician partner offices were in federally designated underserved communities. The company explained that they increase access to physicians, again for individuals that historically may not have great access to primary care. And lastly, there is an opportunity for better health management to raise the health of the community with enough scale.

Of course, there have to be some “losers” from this trend, and we see those being fast food restaurants, emergency rooms, inefficient facility based operators and any entity contributing to the deterioration of health in the country. There is a long way to go for most hospitals in the US. A National Bureau of Economic Research authored by Zack Cooper, Joseph J. Doyle Jr., John A. Graves and Jonathan Gruber entitled “Do higher priced hospitals deliver higher quality care?” noted:

“Being admitted to a hospital with two standard deviations higher prices raises spending by 52% and lowers mortality by 1 percentage point (35%). However, the relationship between higher prices and lower mortality is only present at hospitals in less concentrated markets. Receiving care from an expensive hospital in a concentrated market increases spending but has no detectable effect on mortality.”

We’re not sure that it’s a bad thing that these entities are net losers from the trend.

2.  **It works! We are already seeing favorable outcome data from all of the companies in this sector.** This is a pretty simple point but likely the most important. The single biggest determinant of success for these companies will be the ability to bend the cost curve. Again, the premise of physician enablement rests on the ability to capture the value of savings against the mostly FFS benchmark world. If these companies can reduce costs, they will be able to benefit financially from that success. In the chart below we show various metrics reported from the companies in this sector. We readily admit that much of this is apples to oranges (companies mentioned can send their complaints to

WontGetRead@nephronresearch.com). That said, we are simply showing the direction and magnitude of success in certain areas. The companies below are reporting an average of 39% fewer hospital admissions than FFS benchmarks, with ER visits down by 50%.

Additionally, there is mounting data that proves the value of consolidating physicians into larger and more sophisticated practices. There are dozens of papers that are investigating the benefits of organizing physician groups, and especially primary care physicians. We point to a Wiley research article (Jonathan Zhang, Yiwei Chen, Liran Einav, Jonathan Levin, and Jay Bhattacharya) entitled ‘Consolidation of primary care physicians and its impact on healthcare utilization.” We found this one to be particularly compelling in that the researchers focus on data as old as 2008, well before the sophisticated tools of physician enablement of today were available. Our thought was that the aggregation of physician knowledge into larger groups was proven effective, even without the aid of today’s technology. The abstract is pretty clear:

“Our preferred specification suggests that patients switching from small to large physician organizations reduce their overall healthcare spending by 16%, and that this reduction is primarily driven by a 13% reduction in primary care visits and 0.09 (21%) fewer inpatient admissions per year.”

3.  **The pressures seen in the healthcare labor force are exacerbating the need for efficiency, providing what we believe will be yet another tailwind to the adoption of physician enablement.** A recent presentation by the Emory Healthcare System highlighted what is now being called the “great resignation” in healthcare. Since the start of the pandemic in February 2020, healthcare employment is down an aggregate ~3%, well below the overall employment totals. With the exception of outpatient settings (where we continue to see a shift of volumes from impatient to outpatient), physician offices are the only sites that employ more people today than prior to the pandemic. Post-acute settings like SNFs have seen the highest levels of pressure.

**The pressures seen in the healthcare labor force are exacerbating the need for efficiency, proving what we believe will be yet another tailwind to the adoption of physician enablement.**

With that, we have seen significant pressure in employment costs. In addition to reduced employment and higher base wages, we have seen a spike in contract employment. BLS data suggests that contract labor rates for RNs have moved from approximately $80 per hour prior to the pandemic, to over $180 per hour in February 2022. While we don’t expect those peak rates to be sustained, we don’t see a quick return to the pre-pandemic levels either.

All of this is pushing more and more for efficient care. We obviously believe that valued-base care and the movement to physician enablement is part of the solution.

4.  **While a subtle difference, the results in fully delegated risk arrangements where physicians are taking upside and downside risk tend to be significantly more impactful than just upside.** In a recent article in JAMA a study was performed on approximately 490,000 Medicare Advantage lives it was clear that full risk was the most impactful care delivery mechanism. As shown below, MA beneficiaries in a value based arrangements showed a decline in hospitalizations of 4.2% relative to its FFS cohort, a 7.6% reduction in observation stays and a 13.4% reduction in ED visits. The results were significantly better when focusing on “avoidable” utilization which was determined by an algorithm used by the authors of the study.

Perhaps even more important than the obvious reductions in utilization for full risk arrangements, was the fact that the improvements in care were very small when physicians only had upside. Again, looking at the data, there was virtually no change in utilization patterns relative to FFS for the “upside only” cohorts with hospitalizations actually higher than FFS! We highlight this important nuance as payors tend to have a majority of their value based care contracts in “upside only” contracts. Conversely, the true physician enablement companies tend to have 100% upside/downside risk.

5.  **The evolution of technologies pointed at healthcare, specifically allowing for services moving to the home, will allow for enhanced growth in value based services.** One of the more exciting facets of the physician enablement movement is the development of purpose built technologies to support the primary care physician. For decades, HCIT has focused on areas such as revenue cycle management, electronic health records, interoperability, etc. In many ways, HCIT has advanced the problems of high cost care in the US as opposed to creating solutions. Today, we are seeing companies develop their own

home grown systems. These revolutions are changing the way that members access the system, providers view their populations and payors track operating performance. Oak Street speaks to their model powered by Canopy, Cano uses the CanoPanarama, CareMax uses CareOptimize, agilon has the agilon Total Care Model, Privia uses an end-to-end self-developed system, Alignment Health has AVA (Alignment’s Virtual Application), Aledade has developed the Aledade App – you get the point. Importantly, none of these solutions are bought off the shelf, and none of them are just modest customizations of older systems. Again, these are technologies that are created specifically for the purpose of physician enablement.

At this point, we believe that there are significant opportunities for these technologies to move more care to the home setting. McKinsey performed a recent survey that polled physicians on what types of care can ultimately move to the home. The report suggested that $265 billion of Medicare services could shift to the home by 2025, which is not exactly the distant future at this point. The chart below shows what % of care that is currently performed in a setting that providers believe can ultimately move to the home. Again, technology is already making significant impacts on areas beyond primary care, especially dialysis, infusion, etc.

6.  **Health insurance has detached from the traditional supply/demand curve and is forcing the country to think about the management of healthcare differently.** For decades we have argued that the typical supply and demand dynamics don’t fully apply to healthcare. Decisions in healthcare are not always economically rational, especially in areas such as end of life care, emergency care and even many specialties. The fee-for-service nature of a large majority of healthcare services also contributes to the disconnect.

Readers need not look any further than inflation data. According to the BLS May release, year-over-year inflation was:

*   1.1% for physician services
*   1.9% for prescription drugs
*   3.4% for nursing home care
*   3.5% for outpatient services
*   3.9% for inpatient services

---

# Nephron Research July 14, 2022

*   **13.8% for health insurance**

This all against the broader context of overall Medical CPI rising 3.7% and Overall CPI up 8.6%.

As the chart below suggests, there is very little correlation between Medical Care CPI and overall CPI. The largest components of Medical Care CPI include Professional services (Doctors, dentists, etc) that make up 42% of the index, Hospital services (inpatient, outpatient, SNF) at 30% and Medicinal drugs at 17%. Medical Care CPI consistently runs higher than overall CPI, with the exception of the most recent months (mostly food and energy driven).

So why does healthcare inflation matter? Because it is yet another signal of a healthcare system that is not optimally structured. While the movement to physician enablement is not necessary a “cure all” for healthcare inflation, it certainly seems like an alternative to the status quo.

## CVS as a Specific Catalyst for the Physician Enablement Sector

While the market is already anticipating significant action(s) from CVS, we think that event could provide a catalyst for the entire physician enablement space. We start from a competitive standpoint and highlight that all of the major payors have formed entities with healthcare services that are focused on extracting additional value from their large membership bases. We note that the PBM was a relatively obvious first area of attack with UnitedHealth, Cigna, Humana, Elevance, CVS, Kaiser and many others now maintaining internal PBMs. The next evolution was the creation of services segments to aggregate various add-on services. UnitedHealthcare has Optum, Cigna has Evernorth, Elevance has Carelon (or Anthem has DBG), Humana has Centerwell, etc. The services include all sorts of areas including primary care (risk bearing especially), home health, chronic care management, data/analytics, behavioral health, other ancillary services and many more. Basically a very wide array of services that can be sold to payors.

CVS similarly is looking for ways to extract value from its membership base of more than 30 million customers (including Part D lives). While there are only a few companies with the size and national breadth of CVS’ health benefits segment, there are still some constraints to the ability to create value from any company’s insurance operations. Remember, the health benefits segment for CVS (and any other health insurer) is subject to MLR minimums (quasi-profit caps) and risk based capital requirements (capital intensity). One of the most effective ways to further capture value beyond the provision of insurance is through the delegation of risk to provider entities. This entire report is dedicated to the value created through risk based arrangements. When you look at the simple economics (see our section on Valuation), a company can generate MORE profits with much less capital through the provision of care. That is why it makes so much sense for CVS to build out its physician enablement capabilities.

## What Does CVS Want to Achieve?

It is important to understand what CVS is looking to do. Starting back on December 9th, CVS made it very clear that the company would be pursuing a new strategy for the overall enterprise, with physician enablement as a main tenet of that strategy. The company’s first investor conference under the new management led with a promise of “bold shifts” in the strategy, with the first bullet point.

Based on conversations and disclosures from CVS over the past 8 months, we think it is clear that CVS wants to create more value off its large membership base by controlling more of the care delivery. UnitedHealth manages over 54mm members (we are including Part D lives for all companies), Anthem manages 47mm, Centene manages 26mm, and Cigna manages 20mm. Through the Health

**We start from a competitive standpoint and highlight that all of the major payors have formed entities with healthcare services that are focused on extracting additional value from their large membership bases.**

Care Benefits segment (i.e. Aetna), CVS manages almost 31mm lives which puts the company as the third largest. Ultimately, the company speaks to a goal of “Maximizing the lifetime value of a consumer by shifting from transactional based primary care to addressing holistic health.” Perhaps most important were the bullet points that CFO Shawn Guertin laid out on December 9th:

*   **CVS Goal:** Build a risk-enabled, vertically-aligned, all-payer care delivery business
    *   **Nephron Translation:** Relatively obvious at this point, that CVS wants to create a physician enablement entity that takes risk in a payor agnostic manner. Think OptumCare for UnitedHealth.
*   **CVS Goal:** Establish a network of physician-led primary care centers with integrated virtual and home assets
    *   **Nephron Translation:** While this sounds like the center-based models of Oak Street, Cano, Caremax, ChenMed, etc, CVS clearly wants a more holistic approach. CVS is looking for PCPs to lead centers as a hub, with telehealth and home care integrated into those offerings. While patient care will be focused on that center/HUB, additional care will be directed both virtually and in the home. The company had a good slide that speaks to the various parts needed to achieve this goal (below).Think Humana in South Florida (with stronger telehealth support).

*   **CVS Goal:** Enhance Management Services Organization (MSO) capabilities to enable partnered providers, payers, and support primary care centers
    *   **Nephron Translation:** This objective speaks to the tech-enabled physician enablement companies that are focused on managing independent physicians and groups to help manage the risk of populations. CVS isn’t looking to employ these physicians, but rather enable those doctors and other providers with technology and support to help reduce costs and improve outcomes. Think agilon/Privia.
*   **CVS Goal:** Deploy existing ecosystem of assets (e.g., CVS HealthHUB® and retail locations)
    *   **Nephron Translation:** This is more of an optimization goal and less of a need to create or acquire new assets. CVS simply wants to use its real estate footprint more efficiently, especially in light of retail trends. Think VillageMD embedded in a Walgreens.
*   **CVS Goal:** Secure assets that extend care delivery and enhance fulfillment

*   **Nephron Translation:** Not particularly clear to us but likely speaks to the ability to care for patients in the home, especially around areas like home infusion.

Ultimately, care delivery and health services are expected to have a material impact on the growth rate of the company. CVS has spoken to a “low-double digit” EPS growth rate beginning in 2024, with 200bps of that coming from these new capabilities. By both enhancing the value of the foundational businesses and then creating new revenue sources, CVS believes that a physician enablement strategy can accelerate overall growth from high-single digits to low-double digits. We believe that would leave investors to afford a shift from the current retail sector multiple to a healthcare services/payor multiple.

## What Advantages does CVS Maintain?

CVS maintains a few distinct advantages in its pursuit of a physician enablement strategy.

First, the company suggests in their 2021 10-K a network of “approximately 1.5 million participating providers.” It is hard to know what exactly makes up that 1.5 million, but we would assume a large majority of practicing physicians in the US are included in that total. With that, a successful strategy for risk delegation and physician enablement should be able to help CVS as much as any other health insurer in the country. The company simply has a ton of whitespace to work with.

Second, CVS has a network of pharmacists that have an advantage in value based care. While the last disclosure we could find was that CVS employed 30,000 pharmacists in 2018, we would guess that total has grown slightly. It's likely that CVS has more than 10% of the total US market share of Pharmacists (BLS counts 313K pharmacists in the US). The most obvious advantage of employing pharmacists is that the interaction between the patient and pharmacist is the most frequent of any healthcare related interaction for the patient. What if CVS pharmacists knew that they were at risk for the costs associated with a customer that came to fill a script? It would be very reasonable to think that medication adherence would improve, that drug interaction issues would fall, and that pharmaceutical care would improve. It would also reason that preventive screenings could increase (pharmacists could schedule or administer flu shots, etc).

Third, other providers trust pharmacists to be extensions of the care delivery process. Express Scripts published some interesting data in their recent “The Prescription of Trust” report. As the following chart shows, providers have high/moderate trust in pharmacists to perform a broad range of services beyond simply dispensing pills, including medication consulting, vaccines, disease state counseling and many others. Simply put, providers trust pharmacists way beyond just filling scripts and that would be very helpful in risk based arrangements, especially in light of the frequency of interaction.

We do caution that consumer trust in the pharmacists still lags that of the provider. Unsurprisingly, there is a very different level of trust by consumers between their Doctor and their Pharmacist.

Fourth, while CVS has the third largest base of medical membership in the US (an obvious asset), the company also has HUNDREDS of millions of other lives that are impacted through the PBM and Retail segments. We don’t think that CVS can benefit from a value based care arrangement for individuals that are not insured customers, but we do see the various other touchpoints as potential feeders to the ultimate network of physician enablement that the company is looking to create.

## Why Will This Decision Matter So Much?

We think that CVS’ decision will be a catalyst for a few reasons as well. First, it would be hard to imagine another entity doing more due diligence on the subject than CVS. While the company certainly spends significant time vetting any transaction, this transaction (or transactions) carries more weight in light of the company’s overall strategy. The company shifted its view under the (still relatively) new leadership of CEO Karen Lynch, who recruited Shawn Guertin as CFO. Guertin spent many years in health insurance including Aetna and Coventry and has been a proponent of the physician enablement strategy. Under Guertin the company added Tom Cowhey as Senior Vice President, Capital Markets whose responsibilities span everything from corporate development and investment to Treasury. We don’t think it’s a coincidence that CVS recruited another managed care veteran with significant experience in this area. In fact, we wouldn’t be surprised to hear about additional hires (with experience analyzing the broader competitive landscape) to augment its strategy around physician enablement and how best to position CVS in the future.

Second, should CVS succeed in finding a target (or multiple targets) to acquire, it would set a reasonable valuation floor for the industry. We have argued that the multiples set by a series of IPOs and SPAC transactions simply anchored the group to unreasonable starting points. Those transactions used revenue multiples as valuation metrics and we simply can’t understand how that is helpful (see our Valuation section for our methodologies). The market has struggled to grasp more useful valuation metrics and that has left the group without a floor.

Third, any business combination with CVS will signal a meeting of the minds between buyers and sellers. We think that has been an issue in the market as well. While the capital markets have frozen, there has been a dearth of capital raises or other valuation marks in the sector. There is a belief that sellers remain reticent to sell at prices significantly below last year’s values, while buyers remain skeptical at even current valuations. A CVS acquisition would be a catalyst to re-open discussions for both public and private companies at a more reasonable starting point.

Fourth, CVS will have to explain both the strategic rationale and financial justification for any transaction. The strategic rationale should impact some companies more than others. If CVS decides that it needs to buy a company that maintains care through a center based model (OSH, CANO, etc), that would suggest to the market that care is best conducted in that setting. Should CVS buy a tech enabler (AGL, PRVA, etc) that would signal to the market that a capital light approach can still be effective in care management. Additionally, CVS will likely have to make some commentary on the financial impact. While the company has suggested that it would prefer companies with positive EBITDA, we think that many transactions would be accretive, especially in the long term. And virtually any company that is successful in physician enablement would be accretive to the long term growth rate for CVS (which is what the company is banking on in its long term guidance).

## What Should CVS Do?

In this report, we highlight several dozen companies operating in the physician enablement sector, both public and private. We won’t pretend to know exactly what CVS is targeting, but we think there are several factors that are important in the consideration.

---

# Nephron Research July 14, 2022

First, we know that CVS already has too much physical space, even with the company’s current plan on closing 10% of stores. Despite that, we don’t think that the current store footprint is the ultimate solution for center based care. The issues include square footage, layout, zoning, the ability to recruit a physician to become a CVS employee in a store, and several others. Of course, that doesn’t preclude the use of a “couple hundred stores” as part of the solution. With that, we think that center based companies remain a viable option.

Second, we know that CVS has one of the largest provider networks in the country. The 10-K suggests its ‘nationwide provider network had approximately 1.5 million participating providers” which seems relatively large considering there are less than 1mm physicians in the US (obviously the definition of providers is broader than just physicians). Because the company has such a large base of providers, it would make sense to find a scalable technology that could be rolled out nationwide with less capital intensity. Remember, centers cost about $1.5mm to build (it’s conceivable that CVS could save some money retrofitting existing boxes), and typically lose another $3-$5mm before breakeven. With that, we believe that tech-enabler is perhaps a more likely part of the solution.

Third, while CVS is starting its focus on the senior markets, ultimately the company believes that physician enablement can be implemented across all of its insurance segments such as commercial and Medicaid. There are a subset of these companies that are focused exclusively on the senior market, which would fill the immediate need. Perhaps those senior focused companies could expand into adjacent segments, but we believe that CVS would be better suited by a company with capabilities to take risk across all segments of health insurance.

Unfortunately a single solution simply doesn’t exist and CVS will likely need multiple transactions or investments, that will take several years to establish. At this point, it is clear that CVS is motivated to move in this direction. It is also clear that CVS is playing catch up to some of the largest competitors in the industry. Ultimately, we believe that CVS will likely look at both center based and tech-enabled companies, as well as the development of its existing footprint and assets, and there are obvious complicating factors like the need for a willing seller. Perhaps a pair of transactions like Cano Health and Privia Health would satisfy the basis of CVS’ ultimate physician enablement strategy.

**Unfortunately a single solution simply doesn’t exist and CVS will likely need multiple transactions or investments, that will take several years to establish.**

## Risks That Challenge our Thesis

1.  **There is an arms race for clinical talent that can support value based care, with various constituents competing for a shrinking pool of talent.** There is a relatively set number of physicians that are capable of operating under risk bearing arrangements. Back in 1975 there were approximately 335K licensed physicians in the United States. At that time, this represented approximately 15 doctors per 10,000 residents of the US. The occupation was very highly regarded, interest in Medicine was very strong and Med Schools were producing far more physicians each year than were retiring. Fast forward to today, and much has changed. As the chart below shows, we estimate that physicians per 10,000 residents will fall in 2022 for the first time in decades. A recent report from the AAMC cited pending retirements and the aging of the physician workforce as key reasons for an expected shortfall of up to 139K physicians by 2033.

Next, we note that competition for this physician base is certainly getting more competitive. According to a recent analysis by Avalere, there has been a tremendous shift in physician employment over just the past three years. We believe that the COVID pandemic was partially responsible for this trend as independent physicians looked for more stable income and recognized the increasing administrative burden. That said, we believe that the physician enablement movement is the single biggest driver of this trend. At the start of 2019, approximately 37.8% of physicians were independent with 46.9% employed by a hospital or health system. The trend over the past decade had been for a significant increase in hospital based employment. At that time, only 15.3% of physicians reported being employed by a corporate entity that included areas like private equity backed physician groups, health insurance entities, and other corporations. **In just three years, the % of physicians employed by corporate entities has risen from 15.3% to 21.8%, an increase of 42% over that time period.** For some further perspective, in 2018 OptumHealth (as part of UnitedHealthcare) reported that they employed, managed or contracted with 35,000 physicians. Today, UnitedHealth reports employing nearly 135,000 clinical professionals (NOT all physicians). It is conceivable that UnitedHealth alone has moved the % of physicians employed by corporate entities by 200-300bps!

**In just three years, the % of physicians employed by corporate entities has risen from 15.3% to 21.8%, an increase of 42% over that time period.**

And obviously this has all accelerated through the pandemic. While now a little dated (data through January 2021), the Physicians Advocacy Institute released data last year that showed in just two years, 2019-2020, there was an increase in hospital employed physicians of 6.6% and a 32.3% increase in physicians employed by corporate entities.

And lastly, physician opportunities in primary care continue to go unfilled. After the 2022 matching season for doctors, the fill rates in primary care areas were some of the lowest across all specialties.

Whereas Pediatrics was able to show 57% of positions filled by MDs, and 97% overall, open positions in family medicine were filled by MDs just 31% of the time, with a total fill rate barely over 90%.

2.  **Similar to the point above, the compensation for primary care physicians simply lags almost all specialties creating an economic disincentive.** We wanted to separate this point from the one above due to the importance. It is clear that there is a cohort of medical professionals that seek employment in healthcare for a large moral purpose. We could have cited dozens of surveys, and show the recent SullivenCotter report findings below. Primary care physicians earn an average of $250K per year, with cardiologists earnings 2x that, and neurosurgeons more than 3x. And please don’t think about the value of a seasoned primary care physician relative to articles on starting financial services analysts like this one: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/02/goldman-sachs-joins-wall-street-rivals-in-boosting-junior-banker-salaries-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/02/goldman-sachs-joins-wall-street-rivals-in-boosting-junior-banker-salaries-.html)

While economics may not be the main motivation for individuals that pursue careers in primary care, we do note that the compensation levels for other specialties can ultimately be a temptation.

3.  **One issue to watch is the potential pushback against “top of the license” practices, which have been seen as a great tool to improve efficiency.** The basic idea here is for non-physician clinicians to assume more responsibility for the care of a patient. There are many tasks that can be performed by

PAs, NPs and others that simply take up time for the physician. If you have been to an urgent care clinic in the past couple of years, it’s likely that a majority of your time with a clinician was NOT with a physician, but rather a PA, an NP, a nurse (perhaps an RN) or any level clinician all the way down to a medical scribe. On the one very obvious hand, this certainly allows more leverage for a physician to serve more patients and attend to the more complicated tasks, while reducing the cost of care by using a lower cost of labor. There are other benefits such as improving access to care in rural and underserved areas.

According to Axios, in 25 states and DC there are laws allowing "unrestricted independent practice" by NPs, with New York the latest signing legislation in early April 2022.

But recently we have started to see some pushback on the concept. We point to a recent Forbes editorial by Dr. Sachin Jain where he speaks to the “great American healthcare labor arbitrage.” Jain speaks to the fact that the training is very different for every level of clinician, and while not every patient NEEDS to see a physician, sometimes you don’t know if the patient SHOULD see a physician. The article speaks to the underlying assumption that these clinicians are interchangeable, which feels obviously off to us. Not surprisingly the AMA has been fighting this trend and much of the legislation with statements such as “The American Medical Association strongly supports physician-led team-based care where all members of the team use their unique knowledge and valuable contributions to enhance patient outcomes.” Additionally, Axios reported recently on the intensification of “scope of practice fights” and noted proposed legislation that would have allowed NPs and PAs to take on more responsibilities for workers comp injuries. Basically non-physicians would be able to bill (and get reimbursed) for certain workers comp claims and serve as experts to support the filing of a WC claim. AMA CEO Madara was quoted opposing the bill by stating “H.R. 6087 effectively removes physicians from the care team and sets up our federal workers for suboptimal health outcomes and increased costs.”

We also point to the chart below from Epic research that suggests nursing experience is dropping quickly through the pandemic.

Our point here is that there are going to be risks associated with the explosion of physician enablement, and if there are anecdotes of care being sacrificed, that could become a major issue.

4.  **We continue to focus on companies that provide medical cost savings, as we (and everyone else) believe that scrutiny around coding efficiency could jeopardize the success of companies that are solely focused on revenue maximization.** There are two ways to increase profits in value based arrangements. The first is to create value by providing better, higher quality care that in turn reduces medical expense. We quote many metrics for success with physician enablement companies focused on reducing bed days/100o, ED visits, and other basic metrics. We also see significant cost reductions from preventive medicine especially in areas such as diabetes and cardiac care.

The other way to increase profits is to maximize reimbursement. We are less concerned about companies that are upcoding or actually breaking the law – those companies are always caught in the long run. We are more concerned about companies that are operating in a 100% compliant fashion, but simply focused on the increasing codes for their population. Again, these companies can be doing everything by the letter of the law, but we see less long term value in those operators.

For some background, in Medicare Advantage CMS pays plans for the risk (i.e. health) of their populations. The system has been around since the 1990’s and ensures that MA plans are paid appropriately for the risk conditions of their membership (the Hierarchical condition category, of HCCs). The idea was to make sure that MA plans weren’t cherry picking the healthiest members, as was seen before the BBA of 1997. In today’s MA environment, we are seeing extremely sophisticated methods of collecting those HCCs including the use of AI, and vendors hired specifically for chart reviews. **A major risk in our view is that value based care contracts incent physicians to maximize the HCCs and therefore the coding.** Remember, the physician enablement companies typically receive a % of the premium, which includes the extra payments for HCCs. These companies have a clear incentive to maximize the coding.

A recent quote from Secretary of HHS Xavier Becerra suggested that CMS is going to be taking a stronger look at these trends, and even cited “evidence” of potential inappropriate coding:

“So far from what I understand in the evidence and data, it shows that we spend more per Medicare recipient through MA than through fee-for-service…We have seen some evidence that in certain areas there seems to be charges that go beyond what would be necessary.”

Additionally, in a letter dated April 20, 2022, from 19 members of Congress (yes, we know these were 19 of the most liberal members of congress including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, et al), asked CMS to look into “significant overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans,” and was concerned about the 8.5% rate increase for MA plans outlined in the 2023 preliminary notice. The letter called out record profits and growth at Anthem and UnitedHealth that was “driven by taxpayers dollars.” The letter cited a recent MedPAC report “CMS paid Medicare Advantage plans 4 percent more per enrollee than Traditional Medicare,16 despite the fact that Medicare Advantage plans spend up to 25 percent less on health care per enrollee.”

**In the end – we recommend investors focus on companies that have strong output metrics around the cost of care. Look for companies that are showing cost trend PMPMs that are flat to down over time.**

5.  **A relatively obvious risk exists for physician enablement in the sense that the movement is going against a very ingrained FFS industry.** As noted, we estimate that the opportunity for Physician Enablement is tremendous with a large majority of the industry not yet in value based care arrangements. But the converse is true, and this increases the difficulties in converting physicians to a value based care contract. Simply put, physicians are trained in FFS and work toward the maximization of incentives in that world.

We point to a study that we reviewed in our weekly on March 17, 2022. The study, published in JAMA, analyzed whether health system-affiliated physician organizations (POs) compensated their physicians in a way that incentivized higher volumes instead of promoting higher value care. As part of this analysis, the study assessed the extent to which volume-based factors impacted physician compensation. More specifically, the study looked at what percentage of total PCP and specialist compensation was based on criteria related to the volume of services rendered. Data for the study was collected by surveying leaders from 31 POs affiliated with 22 health systems across 4 states (California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Washington). In terms of geographic dispersion, 15 of the surveyed POs were located in California (48%), 3 were in Washington (10%), 7 were in Minnesota (23%), and 6 were in Wisconsin (19%). All 31 POs provided information on PCP compensation, though only 30 POs provided data on compensation arrangements for specialists.

In terms of base compensation incentives, volume was the most commonly included compensation mechanism for both PCPs and specialists. Of the 31 surveyed POs, approximately 26 noted that volume of services was included as a component to their base PCP compensation model. Within this group, volume metrics comprised an average of 68.2% of PCP total compensation. Of the 30 POs that provided data on specialists, a total of 28 included volume as a component of base compensation. Among these 28 POs, volumes impacted an average of 73.7% of the total compensation received by specialists.

Among PO leaders surveyed in the study, increasing the volume of services was the most commonly cited method by which physicians could increase their total compensation. Approximately 21 of the 30 POs that completed surveys for PCPs and specialists noted that increasing volumes was the top action physicians could take to boost their overall compensation. Among the top 3 actions that PCPs could take to increase their total pay, increasing volumes was cited 29 times (among 84 total actions). Among specialists, increasing volume was cited as a top 3 action to boost compensation a total of 34 times (among 72 total actions). The second most commonly cited action for increasing physicians compensation was improving clinical quality, noted a total of 19 times among the top 3 actions for PCPs and 12 times among the top 3 actions for specialists.

**Among specialists, increasing volume was cited as a top 3 action to boost compensation a total of 34 times (among 72 total actions).**

6)  **Related to the point above, Hospitals control a significant amount of healthcare power and will ultimately be forced to act in their best interests.** Most industry observers see the main savings from physician enablement occurring through inpatient cost savings. Every company in the space has a slide in their deck that highlights reductions in bed days/1,000. There is a great paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research (Laurence C. Baker, M. Kate Bundorf, and Anne Beeson Royalty) that spoke to the changes in Medicare costs when moving from a single physician to a multispecialty group that showed a 28% reduction in total costs, with almost all of that coming from hospital savings.

Eventually, hospitals will need to figure out a way to participate in the physician enablement sector, with the biggest risk being disintermediation. At some point, it is very reasonable to expect hospitals to create their own ACOs, control their (very large) employed physician bases, and perhaps even try to enable those operations internally. The good news here is that even the most sophisticated hospital operators in the country are still very reluctant to participate in value based case. The dialogue from the HCA October 22, 2021 third quarter 2021 earnings call was interesting:

**Question:** My question is on value-based care. From the perspective that HCA is the largest hospital operator in the country, one of the largest employers of physicians in the country. So, do you look at this movement, and it doesn't feel like it's being felt much at the facility level, but do you think there are opportunities for HCA on the hospital side to benefit from value-based care contracts? And then how do you think about opportunities for your physician base? Because I know there's a ton of conversation around enabling providers at this point?

**Answer:** (paraphrased with emphasis added in certain places): Well, we have certain aspects of value-based care embedded in, obviously, Medicare reimbursement. In some of our commercial contracts, we have aspects of value-based care component as part of our reimbursement methodologies. That will continue, I think, into the future.

Is it accelerating in our facility structures? No. Inside of our physician platform, we do see opportunities to continue to push further into value-based care. Again, in that particular platform in our company, we have aspects of value-based care. They vary a little bit from one market to the other depending on the circumstances and the demographics and payer dynamics in those markets. So, we do see it growing more in the physician platform than on the facility side, I would submit.

So, that's a key part of our approach and that's why it's important for our model within each of the markets to be comprehensive, both in outpatient offerings, convenient for the patients. And then, having different price points for the payers, but ultimately creating a full system that can offer solutions. And we adjust those solutions to fit the situation with each payer. And some of that, again, can be value-based. Some of it can be a different approach as to other reimbursement terms. But we think we're striking the right balance in how we approach that.

## Valuation: Unit Economics and Methods of Valuing these Companies

For the better part of the last two years, we have been on an education tour for our clients. We have written mostly about the mechanics of physician enablement, and our views on the outlook for the sector. We would be remiss if we didn’t answer the ultimate question – What is this all worth to investors? One of the biggest struggles for industry participants has been demonstrating a financial framework to project returns for the capital markets. While we stress the importance of understanding the movement toward physician enablement, and the potential evolution of healthcare delivery, we understand the imperative around understanding current valuations, though we emphasize the longer term opportunity.

To date, most investors have based their investments on revenue multiples. We would have to double the length of this report to truly express the distaste we have for revenue multiples in this sector. Investors are buying a portion of the future cash flows for an enterprise, but if that enterprise can’t convert revenues to cash flow, they own nothing. In this, admittedly lengthy, section of the report we provide a series of different views on how best to value these companies. Over time, valuations will migrate to more simple measures such as EV/EBITDA, but without reasonable levels of EBITDA for most of these companies, we need to evaluate other metrics. With that, we present ideas on:

*   **Per Member Valuations:** What is the value of capitated member to an organization?
*   **Per Provider Valuations:** What is the value of an employed physician to an organization?
*   **Mature Margin Valuations:** What is the value of the company assuming a mature margin?

## Member based valuations

We start with a clear and simply cash flow based analysis to underscore the value of members managed through provider relationships.

In the chart below, we show that according to CMS, the average national MA reimbursement in 2022 is approximately $1,028.38 per member per month, or $12,341 in annual revenues. Assuming a cash flow margin of approximately 5%, we arrive at $617 of cash flow per member per year. We then apply a multiple of 12x on those cash flows (more on that multiple below) to arrive at a value of an MA life of $7,404. There are obviously many factors that go into that multiple, but we believe this is a good starting point.

### Fig. 24: Framework for Per Member Valuations in Medicare Advantage

| Medicare Advantage | Value     |
| :----------------- | :-------- |
| Premiums PMPY      | $12,341   |
| OCF Margin         | 5.0%      |
| OCF PMPY           | $617      |
| Cash Flow Multiple | 12.0x     |
| Value Per Member   | **$7,404** |

For additional thoughts on the value of a member we present M&A multiples for Medicare Advantage acquisitions done in the past. Over the past two decades we have seen numerous transactions with varying size and scale. The overall average per member acquisition price excluding outliers has been

**One of the biggest struggles for industry participants has been demonstrating a financial framework to project returns for the capital markets.**

approximately $6,202, relatively consistent with our cash flow based valuation metric above. We would also argue that valuations for MA lives have increased over time suggesting a slight premium to the multi-decade M&A average seems reasonable.

For even more backup to the value of an MA life, we point to the public markets. Humana’s current Enterprise value sits at approximately $61.6 billion. If we take a conservative assumption of valuing all of the company’s EBIT the same (remember there are provider and home health assets for Humana too), that implies that Humana’s Medicare Advantage segment is being valued at approximately $8,643 per life, about a 15% premium to our cash flow analysis above. We would argue that premium for Humana makes sense in light of the fact that Humana maintains massive scale (the second largest plan in the country) and is currently operating at margins closer to 4% which is below their long term target of 4.5%-5.0%. Said another way, the market is giving Humana benefit for its scale and margin expansion opportunities.

Next, we move to the value of a patient under a capitated provider arrangement. It is our belief that patients managed by provider enabled entities are worth approximately 4.25x the value of a Medicare Advantage life, or approximately $31,500 per life. Once you have completed your “sigh” we point you to the chart below. Using the same framework we used for Medicare Advantage valuations above, we show that capitated lives generate approximately 85% of the premium of an MA life, BUT at a margin of 15%, that translates into 2.5x the level of annual cash flow per member.

We understand that not all capitated provider patients are created equal and there will be differences across platforms. That said, the two major differences in value per member between physician enablement companies and MA plans are 1) there are no minimum MLR requirements for providers (i.e. no profit caps), and 2) there is significantly less capital required. As noted on the margins, we consistently see provider assets achieving mid-teens margins on their portion of the capitated premiums. Next, we stress the benefit to investors of the reduced capital requirements. For MA plans, incremental lives come with a requirement to hold risk based capital of approximately 10% of premiums. If you add $100 of MA premiums, the entity needs to hold $10 of additional capital. Due to risk based capital rules from insurance commissions, we highlight that RBC is currently earning very little even with the recent spike in interest rates. In the chart below, we show that MA plans are likely

**It is our belief that patients managed by provider enabled entities are worth approx. 4x the value of a Medicare Advantage life, or $31,500 per life.**

earning approximately 30% ROIC on the incremental member. While overall returns are likely in the low 20%’s we are showing incremental returns to highlight the relative difference.

For companies in the physician enablement sector, we note that returns are significantly higher. In the example below, we are using a clinic based model for simplicity. Assuming a cost to build of $1.5mm and a steady state member panel of 2,000 lives, the incremental capex per member is approximately $750 or roughly $143 per year assuming a 7-year average lifetime membership. On top of that we factor in losses in the early years until the clinic can reach maturity and breakeven. We estimate that members generate a negative margin of 10% in the first year, and then a loss of 5% in the second year, breaking even by year three. That equates to $787 annual of investment in the form of up front losses. With that, initial capital combined with the higher margins for physician businesses, this equates to an ROIC that is approximately 68%, or roughly 2.3x the return on an incremental MA life. In our valuation framework above, we similarly set our value per member of 27x, which is roughly 2.3x the value of an MA life with a 25% discount applied for the risk of these new models, which is how we arrive at a multiple of 20x cash flow per capitated member.

We then turn to current valuations for these companies relative to our “theoretical” member valuations to gauge current valuations. For calculation purposes we are estimating the value of an equivalent Medicare Advantage member. So we assign 100% value to MA lives, 75% value to Direct Contracting lives and 40% to Medicaid and commercial (including exchanges) lives. The first thing that pops out is that just one of these companies (Oak Street) is trading at or above our theoretical estimate of the value of a member. There are some trends that emerge that are relatively intuitive. First the insurers are all trading at a significant discount to the theoretical value per member, which based on the above makes sense. With capital requirements and minimum MLRs (and many other factors), the better comparison would probably the value per MA life of $7,404 calculated above. But even with that comparison, only Alignment Health is even in the ballpark since the others are presumed to be in need of more capital, AND questions about their business models remain. Second, the center based group is trading at about 70% of the theoretical value and that is mainly because Oak Street is at an 18% premium to that calculated $32K per life. We see the center based companies likely migrating higher over time as business models mature. Third, as with most conversations around valuation for this group, there is a wide disparity in valuations even within peer segments. Oak Street trades at 3x the value of Caremax, agilon trades at 5x the value of Privia and Alignment trades at 14x the value of Bright!

## Provider based valuations

As we think about the right valuation metrics to measure these companies, we think that value per member is a reasonable starting point, but just the starting point. In fact, we do not expect to use this as a primary valuation metrics in our company specific analyses. We will continue to point to EV/Mature EBITDA, more fundamental discounted cash flow analyses and ultimately the traditional comparison of EV/EBITDA multiples. With all of that said, at this point in the cycle (very early) it may prove more important to measure physicians engaged for each company, as that may be the best predictor of long term opportunity. Remember, this entire movement is about putting the physician at the center. It is the importance of the provider at the center that creates the leverage to grow rapidly. Of course, the ease of use for membership based valuations will likely dictate company values in the shorter term.

One of our key views on the space is that the provider is the generator of value. We believe that effective physician enablement companies will be able to engage their provider base to create value against the unmanaged FFS populations. With that, we think that controlling (hopefully more like partnering with) the provider is the key to long term value. Ultimately, we see the “supply constraint” in physician enablement less about members or even payor contracts, and more about engaged providers that can execute the plan. If companies are successful in amassing large provider bases in a successful value-creating physician enablement environment, the health plan contracts will come and the members will follow. The scalability of a value based contract depends most on the provider. Again, this is more about systems to support physicians and less about revenue aggregation. With that, it makes senses to think about the value a provider can bring to a physician enablement company.

**Ultimately, we see the “supply constraint” in physician enablement less about members or even payor contracts, and more about engaged providers that can execute the plan.**

Putting some numbers to it, we think the value of a PCP is approximately $10-15 million. For a commercial population, we estimate the average PCP has a panel of 4,000 patients assuming 100% of the physicians patients are commercial (we know that isn’t how it works). We think the panel size is even more manageable with the help of a physician enablement organization. According to KFF.org, the average commercial premium for a single individual in 2021 was $644.92. With that, we estimate that a PCP treating a commercial population would generate capitated payments (85% of premiums) of approximately $26 million. Assuming the physician can earn a 5%-10% margin on their specific commercial practice, we estimate that each PCP would bring about $2.0mm of EBITDA. We use a 6x multiple as that tends to correlate with physician practice multiples in the past, AND we are assuming these are independent PCPs, not ones that are part of large ACOs or value based care entities. With that, we estimate the value of a commercial focused physician to be approximately $11.8mm. On the right side of the below figure, we run the same math for a PCP that is caring for MA patients. Note that we assume a panel size of 1,500, a PMPM of $1,100 (still 85% of premiums for capitation) and a margin of 10% to account for the higher per person economics and the greater ability to impact cost of care. We also expect a modest premium to commercial valuations in light of the growth in MA and higher margins. With that, we estimate the value of an MA focused physician to be approximately $13.5mm.

We note that similar ideas have been discussed and point to an early Tweet from Aledade CEO Dr. Farzad Mostashari below. It’s a simple concept, but a group of 100 physicians that each care for 2,000 patients, each spending $5,000 per year adds up to $1 billion in managed spend!

*A tweet from Farzad Mostashari (@Farzad_MD) on Jan 12 states: "1$/ that's right (even if it seems like a crazy number of zeros) 100 PCPs can be a billion dollar business. If they actually believe that they can manage the total cost and quality of care for their patients PCPs have been neglected for so long, making that mental leap is hard". Below is an image of a whiteboard with calculations: "100 PCPs + 2,000 pts / PCP = $5,000 per pt / year = $1,000,000,000".*

Interestingly, the public companies tend to trade at a significant discount to what we view to be the value per provider. The center based companies are the only ones that have a rough correlation to value per physician due to the relative similarity of operating models. Conversely, the value of a provider in a tech enabled model, where the physician enablement company doesn’t necessarily employ the physician, is significantly lower.

## Mature Margin Valuations

Since the ancient romans traded milk producing cattle, there has been an understanding of value in the future. Few industries need that perspective more than the physician enablement companies. We tend to believe that the best method for valuing these companies is through the “opportunity” lens, which is ultimately rooted in a view on the discounted value of future cash flows.

Our simple approach is to assess the current operating breadth, estimate what a mature margin should be on that existing book, and discount back the value. In the chart below, we start with 2023 revenues as a proxy for the existing book of business. While certainly not a given at this point, we believe that visibility is certainly high enough to rely on that as a starting base. Remember a large majority of these companies have already started building/leasing clinics, signed up doctors and made other investments to support 2023. Next, we estimate what a mature margin should be for these businesses. Many of the companies have actually spoke to target margins as well, which helps inform our view. Additionally, some companies have even spoken about their oldest cohorts and where performance sits. For example, Cano Health has stated that its most mature Medicare Advantage cohorts are generating 24% EBITDA margins, and Oak Street and agilon have great cohort analyses around medical margin. Note that our margin assumptions are for the enterprise level and NOT the specific center or contract level. While Cano might achieve margins in the mid-20’s for some of its membership base, we do not expect the totality of the company to ever achieve that level.

As shown, we are seeing a relatively strong correlation for valuations when analyzing mature margin multiples, especially when compared to growth rates (i.e. PEG ratios). We see the center based companies trading in a range of 5x-13x target margins, and the tech enablers in the range of 5x-27x. with the overall group at 11.1x target margins. What is even more telling is how those multiples compare to growth rates. When we compare the target multiples to the 2023 revenue growth rates, we

seen an overall PEG ratio of 0.4x, with a high of 1.2x for Alignment and a low of 0.1x for Clover and P3 Health. In this light, we believe that the physician enablement sector is cheap and presents a significant investment opportunity! Remember, traditional health insurance companies are trading right around a 1.5x PEG to revenues with the broader market (S&P500) closer to 1.6x.

## Physician Market Segment Projections

With this report, we are updating our model to size the ultimate opportunity for companies in the physician enablement sector. Our analysis continues to point to the potential market that exists, and not the actual market today. For example, we believe that there is an addressable or potential market size of $2.1 trillion today. However, we also note that according to the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network, only about 5.1% of 2018 payments to providers involved population based payments, with just 0.4% of payments involving an integrated financial and delivery system. Additionally, some more recent work out of the UPenn Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics (LDI), suggests that even in Medicare Advantage, only 17% of payments were made using population based payments (two sided risk). While there are very few data points on the exact amount of payments made through fully value based arrangements for 2021, we would guess that less than 10% of total payments are through global risk contracts. Said simply – we are at the tip of the iceberg today.

## Medicare Advantage Market Opportunity

### Sizing the MA market

The Medicare Advantage segment is clearly the most important and most dynamic segment of health insurance today (and likely the next several years). While MA revenues grew at 9.1% from 2010-2018 (quite robust), we estimate that the 5 year CAGR from 2018-2023 will be 16.6%. Over that time, we expect the industry to add $269B in annual revenues. Remember, the largest consensus revenue estimate for any of the physician enablement companies is $3.7 billion for agilon – and, again the $269B is just MA. For some further relative perspective to other segments, CMS estimates total Managed Medicaid spending in 2019 to be $311B. By 2031, we estimate the MA industry will be a $1.0 trillion opportunity.

**We size the physician enablement sector at $2.1 trillion today.**

**2010-2018 CAGR: 9.1%**
**2018-2023 CAGR: 16.6%**
**2023-2031 CAGR: 9.3%**

We believe that there are a series of positive catalysts in the near term that support this robust growth rate. We start with the belief that the permanent repeal of the HIF beginning in 2021 is a game changer, meaningfully more important than the one year suspensions seen in 2017 and 2019. We see the rate environment as particularly robust even for 2023 with the change in administration, and note that other flexibilities have been added in recent years to the program to help the plans grow. We continue to see more acceptance of the program generally and each year the benefits available in MA push further ahead of those available under the FFS program.

Next, we continue to stress that MA is the best value from the consumer’s perspective. As noted above, MA is currently providing a higher level of benefit relative to FFS than at any point in history. Conversely, Medicare FFS remains a cumbersome and costly alternative for seniors. While a certain level of Medicare coverage is “free” the spending required for services outside the purview of Medicare continues to increase. The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey showed that Medicare beneficiaries spend an average of $3,403 annually on out of pockets costs and services not covered by Medicare. Remember, that is now 4 years ago, and we estimate that number may be closer to $4,000 per year today for “free” healthcare.

One important thing to keep in mind, we believe that the MA industry has never been this well prepared for any potential changes to the program or reimbursement headwinds. Obviously, the companies won’t phrase the situation the same way we do, but data suggests there is a tremendous “cushion” when comparing MA to the FFS program. We think an even more instructive view of the safety net of benefits in MA (a proxy for attractiveness relative to FFS) is through MedPAC data on the PMPM levels of rebates. The following chart shows the average rebate relative to monthly premiums for the entire MA program. When the ACA passed, the plans were offering approximately $74 worth of additional benefits compared to the FFS program. Said another way, MA members were given $74 monthly in incentives (think lower out of pocket costs and better benefits like hearing, dental, etc) to make the switch to MA. With a relatively strong headwind to reimbursement the rebate premium stayed between $74 and $85 monthly until all of the ACA rate cuts were implemented – through 2016. Basically the MA plans were able to improve their cost structure enough to keep the benefit premium in MA stable. This similarly allowed the MA program to grow overall in the high-single digits though growth was certainly slowing as the cumulative effects of the ACA cuts continued. Then in 2017, the MA plans started receiving stronger rate increases without the ill effects of the ACA – and growth started to accelerate. In 2020, MedPAC stated that the average MA benefit premium (or cushion relative to FFS) reached $122. So MA members were getting almost $1,500 of additional annual value from the average plan. That premium is now closer to $164 in 2022 (almost $2,000 annually!). Overall, the MA industry has more benefit cushion today than at any period in history. Should reimbursement change and CMS implement a modest headwind in 2024 or beyond, we think the MA industry is positioned more than well enough to weather that storm.

We estimate MA industry revenue growth was 17.5% in 2021 and will be 18.7% in 2022, the highest level of revenue growth since 2006 when the drug benefit was added. All in, we are projecting a 10 year CAGR in MA revenues of 10.6%. We think you would be hard pressed to find another segment of healthcare services with a growth rate that robust over the next decade.

We believe that virtually all of the MA market will be an opportunity for physician enablement organizations. While there are certainly populations residing in rural areas, or employer groups, we still believe that physician enablement companies will be able to provide a solution for those plans.

## The Importance of MA to Payors

One of the most important dynamics in the provider enablement movement is the importance to the payors. The desire to improve value through better outcomes and lower costs is the key driver to payor adoption of new delivery models. Nowhere is this more evident than the MA market. As the chart below shows, MA has become significantly more important to the industry. Revenue and EPS

exposure for the sector has grown from about 8% in 2004 to an estimated 25% in 2022. From an EPS perspective, we estimate that MA made up 8% of EPS in 2004 for the group, and we expect that to grow to an average of 21% in 2022. This comes despite the dilution in those exposures from the CVS-Aetna and Cigna-Express Scripts acquisitions.

Today, we believe that the importance is greater than just the revenue or EPS exposure, as MA is crucial to the growth rate of many of these companies. As the next chart shows, while MA has run approximately 23-25% of total company revenues for the sector in recent years, the growth contribution has been much higher. We estimate that approximately 33% of total revenue growth for the group came from MA in 2021 and approximately 31% of all growth for 2022. The segment is far and away the largest contributor to growth for the industry.

## Medicare FFS Market Opportunity

As we approach the Medicare Fee-For-Service opportunity there are a few items to keep in mind. First, we note that this is a broadly unmanaged population that is run by the Federal government. We would even argue that this population is “anti-managed” in that providers have incentives to provide more care, and amass more cost. While it may be redundant to point out, we do not see a lot of value enhancing systems in place for the MFFS program. Second, we believe that the current Biden Administration (and the Trump Administration before that as well) is focused on a new strategy to bring value to the MFFS program which includes new models for care. We think this is a lasting, bi-partisan, trend that will span administrations to come as well. This brings us to the third point – we don’t know for certain how the Physician Enablement movement will ultimately bring value to the Medicare FFS program, BUT we are already seeing some of those potential paths coming into focus. Remember, CMS already lists 12 separate value based care programs on their site (see chart below) with another 14 quality reporting programs in place. While we have less confidence today in the delivery model of physician enablement in Medicare FFS, we have more confidence that the opportunity to provide value is robust. As discussed below, even CMS has an aim of 100% of the MFFS program in value based care arrangements by 2030.

**It is conceivable that the MFFS opportunity is ultimately a larger opportunity for physician enablement than the MA population, and equally conceivable that the market is missing this point.**

We start with an issue that impacts our projections for MA above. We believe that concerns over an erosion of Medicare Advantage due to the modernization of MFFS are misguided. Some argue /that as physicians take risk in the MFFS program, there is less reliance on Medicare Advantage plans for this process. There are several problems with that line of thinking. First, there are very few providers that are equipped for full risk taking and the MA plans will serve as potential enablers for this process. We again remind investors about a conversation we hosted with Fran Soistman, CEO of eHealth and former head of Government for CVS Aetna. Soistman explained the process for which providers need to prepare for risk taking “You can’t just hire a lawyer and open up shop.” There are many complex arrangements that need to be established in the process. Second, there is a significantly higher amount of economic certainty for providers in MA today, and that will likely be the case for several more years. MA plans that delegate risk to providers are simply passing on a percentage of the premium through capitation and providers are able to capture whatever value they prove. In the current MFFS programs (such as MSSP, Direct Contracting ACO REACH, etc.), the government will likely be the entity

**While we have less confidence today in the delivery model of physician enablement in Medicare FFS, we have more confidence that the opportunity to provide value is robust.**

measuring success. Providers in similar programs in the past have simply been notified on an annual basis, well beyond the program year end date, if they were actually successful in saving costs and the government has determined that success. **Said another way, providers are at the mercy of the governments system of measurement and reward.** It is certainly possible that CMS becomes a great payor for value, but the risk is significantly higher than taking capitation in MA. Third, and most importantly, consumers are better served in MA than FFS. MA plans simply offer a better value proposition to the senior through lower out of pocket costs and higher benefit levels. If a senior is willing to designate a doctor as their main provider (i.e. the provider at risk), the senior would similarly be willing to do so in an MA plan. More importantly, through risk adjustment and STAR bonuses, payments to providers will be higher in MA than in MFFS value programs, which provides the physician an incentive to actually migrate their designated patients into an MA plan. **Over time, we believe that ACO REACH and other MFFS value based initiatives are more like to serve as feeders for MA than to serve as competitors to MA.** Ultimately, programs that serve the patient the best, like MA, will be the ones that succeed. And as physicians gain comfort in a risk taking model is MFFS, that familiarity will inure benefit to MA plans as they work with a more willing supply of physicians.

**Not surprisingly, the number of companies looking to address this market is very large and constantly expanding.** We point to a chart put together by our friends at HMA below. There are dozens and dozens of entities looking to address the needs of this specific government program and MANY of them are very newly created.

## The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI)

It is critical to understand the direction and strategy of payment innovation from CMS to size the opportunity in the MFFS market. We think this is most effective by starting with CMMI and evaluating the new models that are already being created. The good news is that we don’t have to guess because on January 11, 2021 the leadership of CMS penned their thoughts in a Health Affairs Article entitled “Building On The CMS Strategic Vision: Working Together For A Stronger Medicare.” The authors were:

---

# Nephron Research July 14, 2022

*   Meena Seshamani: Deputy Administrator and Director of Center for Medicare
*   Elizabeth Fowler: Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation
*   Chiquita Brooks-LaSure: Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

It is fair to say that the opinions of the three top leaders of CMS, including the head of CMMI, are a fair representation of the direction of the program, at least through the end of 2024. The essay points to the goals of 1) advancing health equity; 2) expanding access to affordable coverage and care, 3) driving high quality, person-centered care; and 4) promoting affordability and the sustainability of the Medicare trust funds.

**1) Advancing Health Equity**

The goal here is to address health disparities that “underlie our health system.” CMS expects to use this lens as a filter for all decisions and innovations in the Medicare program in the future. This is a universal goal for the Administration that transcends well past just their healthcare agenda. We would expect CMS to not only review all of its existing programs (think more about new iterations of old programs) but also to create new initiatives to specifically address these inequities. The REACH ACO (discussed more fully) is an example of explicit requirements. We also expect a continued focus on low income and rural markets through this lens. Importantly, **CMS once again is looking for private sector partnerships to accomplish this goal.** The article suggests “We [CMS] know we cannot do this work alone… We will also work with our provider and payer communities, including Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Medicare Advantage plans.” Examples cited included funding of medical residencies in rural hospitals, and more focus on the supplemental benefits that MA plans can offer such as housing, food and transportation.

**2) Expanding Access to Affordable Health Coverage and Care**

While not a direct link to physician enablement, the idea that CMS is promoting access to the Medicare program is obviously important. CMS speaks to making it easier for those eligible to enroll in the program, and then improve access to care. We thought it was very telling in the article when the authors specifically suggested a goal to “increase enrollment in the Medicare Savings Programs,” another sign of just how obvious it is that CMS is pushing for more value in MFFS.

**3) Driving High Quality, Person-Centered Care**

This is where the agenda starts to get very interesting. The idea of value based payments isn’t exactly new but it is clearly accelerating. The article proudly points to the $1.9B in savings that were achieved in the MSSP program in 2020 as a starting point with a boast on quality suggesting, “They’ve shown us that better care coordination, providing care not just within the four walls of a hospital, but across the unique experiences of a person, is key to keeping people healthy.”Just to ground our readers, the $1.9B in savings amounts to less than 0.3% of total Medicare Expenditures – not exactly moving the needle (yet).

And then there is the obvious statement that underlies our belief that a majority of MFFS can move to physician enablement models in the future: “Building on this foundation, we are working across CMS to enhance the movement towards value-based, high-quality care and to ensure that we are all rowing in the same direction so that 100 percent of people with Original Medicare will be in a care relationship with accountability for quality and total cost of care by 2030.” CMS explains that the strategy refresh for CMMI will lead to testing of new payment and service models, which we assume will roll out in the immediate future.

**4) Promoting Affordability and Sustainability**

Ignoring the statement made by CMS that “CMS proudly serves as a responsible steward of public funds”, we do highlight that a main goal of all of the strategic realignment in MFFS is to save costs. With the Medicare Trust fund set to go bankrupt in 2028, the imperative is clear. In this section, the agency pointed to its hope that the Build Back Better Act would pass (I guess nothing is impossible) and therefore pointed to opportunities such as negotiating drug prices directly, capping OOPs in Part D, increasing hospital pricing transparency, and the always included targeting of fraud, waste and abuse. Overall, we would suggest that savings are going to drive a lot of the design in the future, and it would be unlikely that any new programs didn’t include some parameter of savings.

## Sizing the Medicare Fee-For-Service (MFFS) Market

As noted above, the movement to physician enablement is less about the ultimate structure of the organization, nor the segment of the population, and more about the creation of value in the delivery of healthcare through a value based approach. Nowhere is that more evident than the traditional Medicare Fee-For-Service program administered by the Federal government. Since 1965, the United States has provided health insurance coverage for those over the age of 64 as well as other vulnerable populations such as the disabled. While the country has stopped short (despite many fits and starts) of providing Universal Coverage, there is at least some backstop for the senior population.

We go so far as to describe the Medicare FFS as anti-managed. In this program, providers have historically been paid for services performed. The more services done, the higher the payment from the unlimited wallet of the Federal government. While FFS Medicare spending on parts A+B have actually grown slower than MA rates, we believe that is a direct function of a shift of membership into MA plans. As seen below, MFFS revenues grew at 4.2% from 2011-2020 (remember MA was growing at 11.3% per year). Over that time, we estimate the FFS program went from $257B in annual spending (about 207% of MA revenues), to $370B (or 114% of the MA revenue pool). With the growth in MA far outpacing MFFS, we estimate approximate parity in 2021. Perhaps more importantly, we are projecting growth in the MFFS industry from $383B in 2021 to $740B in 2030, a CAGR of about 7.6% while MA will grow an estimated 13.5% per year over that period. While MA will take significant share of the Medicare program in the future, we estimate that MFFS will still be 62% of the size of the MA market.

**Over time, we believe that direct contracting and other MFFS value based initiatives are more like to serve as feeders for MA than to serve as competitors to MA.**

## Commercial Market Opportunity

### Sizing the Commercial Insurance Market

One of the more surprising trends around physician enablement is that the commercial markets are not leading the way. One would think that the commercial markets would be more aggressive in adopting improved care protocols that lead to better value in the system. A skeptic would note that providers are reimbursed highest for their commercial patients and that leads to an incentive of maintaining the status quo. Another view would be the argument that the Federal government sets all the rules for Medicare so implementing new payment structures is simply easier in Medicare. Either way, the commercial markets are likely as big an untapped market as any.

When sizing the commercial market there are two main segments: Risk and ASO. The risk market is further segmented into the individual market, the small group market and the large group market. Remember, these are all companies that are paying risk based premiums to insurance companies. Sizing the market since the passage of the ACA has been easier as insurance companies are required to complete minimum MLR worksheets which show the size of the market. For 2011-2020 we have pulled market sizes directly from those filings. For 2021-2030 we have made projections for each segment. After the brief reductions seen in most commercial markets in 2020 (mainly due to premium rebates), and then the normalization of that factor in 2021, we expect relatively steady growth for the commercial markets. With the overall size of the risk market at $431 billion in 2021, we estimate roughly 3.1% CAGR through 2030 with the individual market rising just over 5% per year, and the employer group markets growing about 2.0%-2.5% per year. **By 2030, we estimate the size of the commercial risk market will approach $567 billion.**

We then turn our attention to the ASO market, or self-funded plans. These plans tend to be run by large multi-site employer groups and are administered by health plans or Third Party Administrators (TPAs) that basically process claims. While the ASO market is technically not an insurance market, the core issue of improving value and lowering costs of healthcare are the same. We see the opportunity for physician enablement as translating relatively seamlessly into the ASO market. Provider groups won’t get a portion of the premium dollar but will still be able to function as a part of the delivery system supporting these accounts.

**The commercial markets are likely as big an untapped market as any.**

# Nephron Research July 14, 2022

According to the latest Kaiser Family Foundation’s Health Benefits Report, approximately 64% of all covered workers are covered under a self-funded, or ASO, plan. This has risen consistently over the past couple of decades as more and more employer groups take advantage of the flexibility and lower costs afforded by such plans. In 2020, there was a noticeable spike about 600bps in the data, which we attribute to a combination of factors including the availability of stop loss products targeted at smaller employer groups. As these funding decisions were made prior to the start of 2020, we do not believe that the pandemic was a contributing factor. That said, there was a 300bps pullback in that % in the 2021 data which we believe is more reasonable. **With that, the ASO marketplace would represent an opportunity that is roughly 78% larger than the risk based commercial market, if just looking solely at members covered.**

In addition to the number of lives covered, we also must consider the level of benefits in an ASO plan relative to a commercial plan. Obviously, we will have to make broad generalizations as there is a great degree of differentiation in the commercial marketplace when it comes to benefit design. With that, ASO plans tend to be administered by larger companies, which in turn tend to provide slightly richer benefits. Said another way, **the ASO market likely maintains a larger opportunity on a per member basis than the commercial markets owing to its more generous coverage.** There is simply more for the provider to manage in ASO plans. This is indeed corroborated by data from the annual Kaiser Family Foundation Health Benefits report. The 2020 report showed that the average annual premiums for a family plan in a risk based product in 2020 is $20,689, with an ASO average plan cost of $21,659 per family, a difference of approximately 4.7%. Interestingly, the data tends to track consistently with plan size as well, with the difference in the cost of a family plan for a large firm in 2020

being approximately 6.1% above a small firm (defined by Kaiser as 200 or fewer employees). It would make sense that the ASO/Risk difference is consistent with the Large/Small firm size differential.

With the above data, we then combine the market share data for ASO plans with the cost differential and compare it to the risk market to estimate the ASO opportunity. Note that we are excluding the individual segment from the commercial risk market as that is not included in the 64% of firms that are ASO. Said differently, we are comparing the ASO market share to just group based commercial risk insurance. When we apply the multipliers to account for the total membership differential, as well as the cost per person differential, we then arrive at an estimate for the market size of the ASO segment. As seen below, we estimate that the commercial ASO market opportunity for physician enablement is $613 billion in 2021, with a CAGR of 2.6% ending 2030 with an opportunity of $869 billion.

## Medicaid Market Opportunity

### Sizing the Medicaid Market

The Medicaid segment is an area where we were least optimistic regarding the adoption of physician enablement as a solution a year ago. While our thoughts are modestly more constructive, we think that it will be a slow start in Medicaid, even if the ultimate opportunity is very strong. At this point, there are only a few companies like CityBlock or Waymark Health targeting the opportunity, but we would expect others to certainly focus here over time.

The main reasons for our skepticism in the short term center around reimbursement and member engagement. First, we note that payments for services in Medicaid are the lowest of any segment, and typically by a wide margin. Providers are constantly struggling to generate even breakeven results on their Medicaid patient populations. While this may suggest a need to reform the system and try new models, we simply see less interest from Providers in Medicaid, especially with the mentality of providing value being limited. Second, the Medicaid population tends to be transient and does not lend itself well to impacting the behavior of the consumer. For many, Medicaid assistance is a temporary situation. We estimate that the average Medicaid managed care member remains with their plan an average of 10 months. The transient nature of the member reduces the ability for a health plan or provider to engage with its membership base and truly impact medical costs over the long term. While there are certainly short term savings opportunities in this population, the longer term savings have been more difficult. Third, though we see a greater opportunity among dual eligibles, some of that is caught in our estimates for MA above, and many duals remain in FFS.

When sizing the Medicaid opportunity we first eliminate the size of the fee for service population in Medicaid. We are yet to see much, if any, innovation from the State’s with regard to reimbursement. At the local level, there just aren’t many examples of opportunities for physician enablement to create value.

Conversely, there are likely more opportunities in Managed Medicaid, particularly with those in higher acuity programs such as LTSS, ABD and even the dual eligibles. The chart below starts with sizing the Medicaid managed care market. Using various data sources including CMS, we estimate total Medicaid spending in 2021 will rise to $706 billion, with managed care controlling approximately 56.3% of that total spend. **With that, we estimate the Managed Medicaid market to be approximately $397 billion in 2021. Assuming penetration of managed care increases by an average of 70bps per year through 2030, with CMS projecting total Medicaid to grow at a CAGR of 5.8%, we project total Managed Medicaid to be $727 billion by 2030.**

As noted above, we simply don’t believe that all of the Managed Medicaid market represents an opportunity for physician enablement. A large majority of the highest acuity membership including long term care, Duals and even some ABD remains in the fee-for-service programs at the state level. While the opportunity for physician enablement will likely rise in the coming decade, we estimate that just **32% of total Managed Medicaid spend in 2021 could be impacted by a physician enablement model. That equates to a market opportunity in Medicaid of approximately $126 billion, growing to $327 billion by 2030.**

## Public Company Financial Comp Sheets

Below, we compiled key financial metrics from publicly traded physician enablement companies to provide a clear comparison of performance. In the following charts, we arrange the universe of publicly traded physician enablement companies into three distinct groupings, including Center-Based Operators (e.g. Cano, CareMax, Oak Street), Insurance Plans (e.g. Bright Health, Oscar, Alignment, Clover, InnovAge), and Tech Enablers (agilon, Privia, P3, Babylon, and The Oncology Institute). Key performance indicators that we have analyzed include historical lives under management, revenue, MLRs, SG&A, and adjusted EBITDA.

Starting with membership, we estimate that center-based operators cared for approximately 477K patients as of 1Q22. This is the smallest amount among the three physician enablement categories, behind both the tech enablers (1.53 million) and insurance plans (2.60 million). We are not very surprised by this, as center-based operators (e.g. Cano Health, CareMax, and Oak Street) have a more capital intensive model and focus primarily on the MA segment. This compares to the health plans/tech enablers (e.g. Bright Health and Privia) that serve multiple customer segments such as the ACA marketplace, MA, Medicaid, and MSSP.

Unsurprisingly, topline results have generally trended together with membership growth. During 2021, we estimate that the group of publicly traded insurance plans generated revenues of almost $9.2 billion, or approximately 2.7x the topline of all center-based operators combined. Tech-enablers recorded a combined $4.4 billion in revenue for 2021, while center-based companies produced total revenues of $3.5 billion. Interestingly, we note that tech-enablers had only 1.3x the revenues of their center-based counterparts, despite having almost 3.1x the number of members. The primary driver of this discrepancy appears to be Privia, due to company’s membership mix (more Medicaid and commercial) and the degree of value-based care penetration. For example, Privia generated an estimated ~12% of its GAAP revenue from value-based care arrangements in 2021. For comparison, approximately ~95% of Cano Health’s revenue in 2021 was generated through capitation.

Reflecting on MLRs, each of the physician enablement segments were able to effectively control MLRs in 2019, even as companies were operating at a smaller scale and just ramping up (i.e. still in “proof of concept” mode). Looking at the cost control metrics, we note that the center-based companies operated at a full-year MLR of 92.1%, with tech enablers at an average of 90.4% and insurers at 86.6%. Stepping into 2020, we saw broad MLR decreases resulting from the beneficial impact of COVID-19 on overall cost utilization, with the average MLR declining 588bps y/y among center-based operators,

246bps y/y for tech enablers, and 301bps y/y for insurance plans. We believe the market incorrectly attributed these gross margin improvements as company driven, though they were actually much more industry driven. The downward trend was quickly reversed in 2021, driven by widely cited challenges related COVID costs as well as MA risk adjustment and risk coding for the IFP population (particularly impactful for Bright Health and Oscar). With that, average MLRs for the center-based operators increased to 93.4% in 2021 (up 719bps y/y), 91.7% for insurers (up 809bps y/y), and 88.1% for tech-enablers (up 22bps y/y). Moving into 2022, we see several key tailwinds for MLRS, including a normalization in MA risk adjustment, lower direct COVID-19 costs, and improved IFP risk documentation (particularly for OSCR/BHG).

Beyond MLRs, we believe there is significant runway within the industry from improved SG&A ratios as companies scale. For example, we estimate that the average SG&A ratio (including stock-based compensation, excluding D&A) for insurance plans was 25.4% in 2021. This is much higher than the average of 12.4% among other insurers within our coverage (e.g. CI, CNC, CVS, ELV, HUM, UNH, MOH). Moving forward, Bright Health is targeting a consolidated SG&A ratio of ~15% by 2024, which would be down significantly from 30.7% in 2021. Oscar is also guiding to significant improvement in SG&A, with management commentary pointing to an InsuranceCo SG&A ratio of 10%-15% by 2025 (down from 23.4% in 2021). Beyond the insurance group, the average SG&A ratio for tech-enablers was also clearly too high at 31.6% during 2021, impacted by stock-based compensation in the second quarter related to the Privia and agilon IPOs.

The majority of the physician enablement industry has been unprofitable at the adjusted EBITDA level. That said, we would generally expect margins to improve as companies become more mature in the public markets. At this point, it is simply irrational to expect that these companies should be operating at mature margin levels given the early stage of development. Currently, tech enablers are generating the highest level of adjusted EBITDA margin, with the average coming in at -0.1% for the group during 2021. For comparison, center-based operators generated an average adjusted EBITDA margin of -3.7% in 2021. Excluding Oak Street (-16.0% adj. EBITDA margin), the center-based group would have actually generated a positive EBITDA margin of 2.5%. After a particularly challenging year, the average adjusted EBITDA margin among insurers was -16.8% in 2021, dragged down by Clover (-32.1%), Bright Health (-26.8%), and Oscar (-23.3%). In terms of company specific callouts, we note that only Cano, CareMax, InnovAge, and Privia were operating at positive adjusted EBITDA margins in 2021.

## Private Company Summaries

## AbsoluteCare

### Overview

Headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, AbsoluteCare is a value-based integrated health care provider that operates under a patient-centered ambulatory care unit delivery model with the goal of increasing access to primary care. The company is led by Michael Radu, who formerly led Medicaid for WellCare, with the company recently adding Joe Wagner, who spent time as the CFO of Clover Health. As their website states, AbsoluteCare offers a concierge, PCP-led coordinated care team, with two nurse care managers, a licensed social worker, and a medical assistant; the core team is augmented by integrated services (onsite radiology, clinical pharmacy, behavioral health ect.) and connections to community services to provide care that goes beyond medicine to holistic care. Think of the business model as one of providing high-touch concierge care for the underserved, mostly under the umbrella of state Medicaid programs. The goal is to provide primary care that stretches into the community.

After opening their first HIV Center of Excellence (Atlanta, 2000) and quickly becoming a leading clinic in the space (88% retention rate, 97% undetectable rate), many of their former patients requested their care teams continue treatment through integrated primary care. Now, having grown to **120 employees, the company operates 5 core primary and preventative care facilities located in Baltimore, Atlanta, New Orleans, Philadelphia, and Prince George’s.** The company's centers focus on providing comprehensive/preventative care for diseases like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, HIV/AIDS to ensure vulnerable and chronically ill patient populations, particularly those covered by Medicaid and Medicare, get affordable primary care.

Their data-driven approach tracks utilization to inform care coordination and has shown success in cost reduction and outcome improvement. The model is organized around care teams (likely 1 physician with 4-5 care team members made up of RNs, PAs, and social workers), with panels that are smaller than what you tend to see with typical physicians. To that end, AbsoulteCare has seen a reduction in inpatient admissions (50%), inpatient days (49%), Emergency Department Visits (34%), and specialist Visits (24%). Additionally, prior to enrollment, quality scores for many of AbsoluteCare’s member population remained in the lower 30th percentile. Below, we highlight how AbsoluteCare “wraparound” approach to holistic care has increased quality- and value-based purchasing outcomes for members compared to traditional member population scores in the lower 30th percentile.
