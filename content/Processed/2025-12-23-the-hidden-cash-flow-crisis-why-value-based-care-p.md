## Abstract

The value-based care industry has developed a concerning blind spot in its risk adjustment strategy. While providers and enablement companies have invested heavily in prospective risk adjustment capabilities at the point of care, they have systematically underinvested in the infrastructure required for efficient retrospective risk adjustment processes. This strategic misalignment creates significant cash flow challenges, as prospective HCC capture can take 18-24 months to translate into premium adjustments and an additional 12-24 months before providers see bonus payments. In contrast, efficient retrospective risk adjustment through automated medical record release can generate more immediate revenue impact for both Medicare Advantage plans and their provider partners. This essay examines the actuarial realities of Medicare Advantage risk adjustment timing, the cash flow implications of current industry practices, and presents a framework for leveraging digital infrastructure solutions to optimize retrospective risk adjustment processes. Through examination of companies like Datavant and their audit relief offerings, we explore how VBC enablement companies can better serve their provider partners by prioritizing release of information automation alongside traditional prospective coding initiatives.

## Introduction: The Misaligned Focus in Value-Based Care

The value-based care ecosystem has reached an inflection point where the gap between strategic intention and operational execution has become a material impediment to sustainable growth. Across the industry, from venture-backed primary care platforms to established Medicare Advantage plans, organizations have poured resources into sophisticated prospective risk adjustment capabilities. These investments, while well-intentioned, reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the cash flow dynamics that drive profitability in risk-based contracts.

The prevailing wisdom has been straightforward and seemingly logical: capture hierarchical condition categories at the point of care, ensure comprehensive documentation, and optimize coding practices to maximize risk adjustment revenue. This approach has spawned an entire cottage industry of clinical decision support tools, coding optimization platforms, and provider training programs. Yet despite these investments, many value-based care organizations continue to struggle with cash flow challenges and find themselves constantly chasing revenue that seems perpetually eighteen months away.

The root of this problem lies not in the quality of prospective risk adjustment efforts, but in the timing mismatch between when these efforts generate revenue and when organizations need cash flow to sustain operations. Meanwhile, a more immediate opportunity sits largely unaddressed: the retrospective risk adjustment process that could deliver revenue impact within quarters rather than years. This opportunity requires a different set of capabilities, centered around the efficient and automated release of medical records to payers conducting risk adjustment audits.

The Medicare Advantage industry processes billions of dollars in risk adjustment revenue annually, and the timing of when this revenue flows through the system has profound implications for every participant. Understanding these timing dynamics is not merely an academic exercise but a business imperative that separates successful value-based care organizations from those that struggle to achieve sustainable unit economics.

## The Economics of Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Timing

To understand why retrospective risk adjustment deserves greater attention, one must first grasp the intricate timing mechanisms that govern Medicare Advantage risk adjustment revenue. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services operates on a complex calendar that creates multiple lag periods between clinical encounters, risk score calculations, premium adjustments, and provider compensation.

When a provider captures a hierarchical condition category during a patient encounter today, that diagnosis enters a process that unfolds over multiple calendar years. The encounter data must first be submitted to CMS through the Risk Adjustment Processing System, where it undergoes initial validation and processing. This submission occurs during specific reporting periods, with encounter data typically due to CMS by the end of January following the service year. However, the actual incorporation of this data into risk scores does not occur until CMS runs its annual risk adjustment model, which typically happens in the summer following the service year.

The calculated risk scores then feed into the premium payment process for the following year, creating a cascade of delays that can extend the time between diagnosis capture and revenue realization to eighteen months or more. For example, a diagnosis captured during a patient encounter in January 2024 would not begin generating premium revenue until January 2025, and depending on the specific timing of model runs and premium calculations, the full revenue impact might not be realized until well into 2025.

This timing challenge becomes even more complex when considering how Medicare Advantage plans share risk adjustment revenue with their provider partners. Most bonus payment programs operate on annual cycles, with performance periods that align with calendar years and payment calculations that occur months after the performance period ends. A provider capturing a diagnosis in early 2024 might not see bonus payments related to that diagnosis until late 2025 or early 2026, creating a cash flow delay that can span nearly three years.

These timing dynamics create a fundamental tension in value-based care economics. Organizations need positive cash flow to invest in care management, technology infrastructure, and provider compensation, but their prospective risk adjustment efforts generate revenue on a timeline that is poorly aligned with operational cash flow needs. This misalignment is particularly acute for venture-backed organizations that face pressure to demonstrate near-term progress toward profitability.

The retrospective risk adjustment process operates on an entirely different timeline that offers more immediate cash flow benefits. When Medicare Advantage plans conduct risk adjustment audits, they are typically reviewing encounters from previous years that are already incorporated into current premium payments. The ability to efficiently respond to these audits and provide supporting medical records can directly impact current-year revenue for both the plan and, through shared savings arrangements, the provider organization.

## Understanding the Cash Flow Implications of Prospective versus Retrospective Risk Adjustment

The cash flow implications of this timing mismatch extend far beyond simple accounting considerations and strike at the heart of value-based care sustainability. Organizations that focus exclusively on prospective risk adjustment are essentially making multi-year investments with highly uncertain returns, while potentially ignoring more immediate revenue opportunities through retrospective risk adjustment excellence.

Consider the economic reality facing a typical value-based primary care organization. These companies often operate on thin margins while investing heavily in technology, care management staff, and provider compensation. The promise of risk adjustment revenue provides the foundation for these investments, but the extended timeline for revenue realization creates a working capital challenge that can persist for years.

A primary care group that successfully captures an additional fifty hierarchical condition categories per thousand patients might expect to generate several hundred thousand dollars in additional annual risk adjustment revenue. However, the cash flow profile of this revenue is heavily back-loaded, with minimal impact in year one, moderate impact in year two, and full impact not realized until year three or later. Meanwhile, the costs associated with generating this revenue, including technology investments, staff training, and care management resources, are front-loaded and must be funded from other sources.

This timing dynamic becomes particularly problematic when organizations attempt to scale rapidly or when they face unexpected operational challenges. The lag between investment and return means that organizations must maintain significant cash reserves or access to capital to bridge the gap between when they incur costs and when they realize the associated revenue benefits.

Retrospective risk adjustment processes offer a fundamentally different cash flow profile. When a Medicare Advantage plan initiates a risk adjustment audit, they are seeking medical records to support diagnoses that are already reflected in current premium payments. The plan's ability to retain these premium dollars depends on their success in the audit process, creating immediate financial incentives for both efficient record retrieval and comprehensive documentation.

Organizations that excel at retrospective risk adjustment can often see revenue impact within a single quarter. A well-designed release of information process can help plans successfully defend millions of dollars in current-year premium revenue, and the shared savings arrangements that govern most value-based care contracts mean that providers can see bonus payments related to this success within months rather than years.

The contrast in cash flow timing is stark and material. While prospective risk adjustment efforts might generate their first meaningful cash flow impact eighteen to twenty-four months after implementation, retrospective risk adjustment improvements can generate positive cash flow within ninety to one hundred twenty days. For organizations operating with limited working capital or facing pressure to demonstrate near-term profitability, this timing difference can be the determining factor in their long-term viability.

## The Medicare Advantage Sweeps Period Reality

The Medicare Advantage risk adjustment audit process, commonly referred to as sweeps periods, operates according to a rigid calendar that creates both opportunities and obligations for participating organizations. Understanding the mechanics and timing of these sweeps periods is essential for any organization seeking to optimize their retrospective risk adjustment performance.

CMS conducts Risk Adjustment Data Validation audits on an annual basis, typically initiating the process in the spring following the service year under review. These audits involve the selection of a statistical sample of enrollees for each Medicare Advantage plan, with medical records requests covering diagnoses that were submitted for risk adjustment purposes. The audit timeline is compressed and unforgiving, with plans typically having thirty to sixty days to respond with comprehensive medical record documentation.

The financial stakes of these audits are enormous. CMS applies the audit results to the plan's entire membership through statistical extrapolation, meaning that a failed audit sample can result in recoupment demands that reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars for large plans. The audit failure rate across the industry has been increasing in recent years, with some estimates suggesting that plans fail to adequately support forty to sixty percent of the diagnoses included in audit samples.

The primary driver of audit failures is not clinical documentation quality but operational efficiency in the medical record retrieval and submission process. Plans and their provider partners often struggle to locate relevant medical records, extract the appropriate documentation, and submit comprehensive responses within the compressed audit timeline. These operational challenges are particularly acute for organizations that rely on manual processes or fragmented health information systems.

The sweeps period timeline creates a natural opportunity for organizations that can streamline the medical record release process. Rather than scrambling to locate and retrieve records during the compressed audit period, organizations that have invested in automated release of information capabilities can respond to audit requests with speed and comprehensiveness that directly translates to improved audit outcomes.

The revenue impact of improved audit performance is immediate and substantial. A Medicare Advantage plan that improves its audit success rate from sixty percent to eighty percent might retain tens of millions of dollars in premium revenue that would otherwise be subject to recoupment. Under typical shared savings arrangements, provider partners can see bonus payments related to this improved performance within the same fiscal year as the audit.

This immediate revenue impact stands in sharp contrast to the extended timeline associated with prospective risk adjustment efforts. Organizations that prioritize retrospective risk adjustment excellence can generate measurable improvements in cash flow within a single audit cycle, while organizations that focus exclusively on prospective efforts must wait multiple years to see comparable financial benefits.

The sweeps period reality also highlights the critical importance of operational excellence over clinical sophistication. While prospective risk adjustment often requires complex clinical decision support and provider behavior modification, retrospective risk adjustment success depends primarily on having robust systems and processes for medical record management and release. These operational capabilities are more predictable to implement and scale than clinical behavior changes.
