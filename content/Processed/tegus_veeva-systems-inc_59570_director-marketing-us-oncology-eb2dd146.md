## Veeva Systems Inc - Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
### Interview conducted on May 11, 2023

#### Topics
* MLR Process, Efficiency, Content Approval, Automation, Pharmaceutical Industry, Tools, ROI

#### Summary
A Tegus Client speaks with a Director of Marketing at Merck & Company, Inc. about the struggles of the MLR process, including misalignment between departments, conservative nature of the organization, and amnesia when pieces move between departments. The Director suggests training and creating previously approved documents with business rules to automate the review process, limiting the number of times going from creation to review, and using AI tools to prescreen content. The Tegus Client proposes a tool for quick feedback on promotional pieces and modular content, which the Director rates a four out of five and suggests uploading business rules with modular content pieces to double-check. The Director notes that Veeva is a great partner for companies with manufacturer success.

#### Expert Details

* Prior to Merck, the expert was the Product Manager at Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Endo International in 2012. The expert was responsible for Xiaflex from launch in 2010 until they left in 2012. Xiaflex launched with hand surgeons and plastic surgeons who were doing hand surgery, and the second iteration was launched was for urology.

#### Tegus Client
Hello. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. So to start, help me understand a little bit about your role and how it relates to MLR. I'm curious, are you familiar with MLR?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes. We call it PRC. I've worked in MLR. So my role has always been as somebody, prior to what I currently do now, who was creating materials and bringing them through for the review process. And then since 2018, at my current organization, I've been somebody who has been helping to redefine the process and as well as I'm a people manager now. I lead a team of eight. So my team members are the ones that are bringing through the marketing materials and promotions materials for review.

And I'm the one that's working with leadership in regulatory, medical and legal to get feedback on our process. I work with our marketing ops teams on these solutions we use to help that process. So the migration from Zinc to 100% into Veeva Vault, which we white-labeled as PromoMats here, as well as the structure. So from a leadership perspective, I kind of am able to help with flow of the process and optimization.

#### Tegus Client
Got it. And then have you ever found the MLR process to be arduous, difficult?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes, all of it. Especially for the 6.5 years I've been in my current organization, we are very conservative and so we've actually set up a pretty unhealthy relationship between all of the different departments that go into this. So by nature here, it's arduous because of the way we've set it up in the sense of not all being aligned to the same business goal. The commercial team is aligned to the commercial goals. But this first organization I worked with, medical, regulatory and legal, don't have any commercial goals in their annual goals. So they're aligned to different things, which that misalignment causes a lot more arduousness in the process.

#### Tegus Client
Interesting. So you would say that marketing and sales folks, who are creating or reflecting the material, very clear that they have commercial goals.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Right.

#### Tegus Client
But the folks in the PRC, regulatory, legal, compliance, they have goals, but it's slightly different. Like what would you say their yearly goals are?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
They all hold the goal that we're not to receive any type of correspondence from either APLB or the FDA. So that alone puts a sense of conservative, to submit, you're saying we are a zero risk tolerant organization.

#### Tegus Client
Got it. And is it just warning letters that they're afraid of? Or is it any sort of lawsuits?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes. So legal would be letters and lawsuits. Regulatory would be compliance letters, et cetera.

#### Tegus Client
Fair enough. So what we're looking at here is kind of the outline of what that process looks like. So as I understand it, at the very top you have product marketing, agency of record, medical, clinical, regulatory, legal compliance, editorial review.

And again, I want to be clear that this doesn't happen kind of in order, this order per se. Some of these things may happen in parallel. Some of these individuals might be the exact same person. Compliance and regulatory might be the exact same person. Some functions happen combined. So some organizations have those two functions I just mentioned, compliance and regulatory, defined as one. So it varies quite a bit.

But in its essence from our research, this is, I would say, 80%, 90% answer of what it looks like in most organizations. And then there's variance within. Like suppose we were to double-click on the regulatory review or the clinical review. You have more details depending on the circumstance, organization, et cetera.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes.

#### Tegus Client
And then there is also marketing ops. Once everything has made it through the review, you go to content prep, and then it's ready to load into some platform. Maybe it's Veeva or some other CMS.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes.

#### Tegus Client
So talk me through where you see things starting to break down the most. I'd love to understand where you see kind of things continually struggle.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
So for my organization now, each bucket has a struggle. I would say overarchingly, one of the largest struggles we have is the amnesia that happens when you bring in one piece to the next. Our teams like to not necessarily remember everything that was made and said before, no matter how it was captured in comments. And we choose our comments that we put into the Veeva system very specifically.

And that's due to that it's run by a lawyer. So the lawyer and the legal entity is the one who's making comments on the piece. So that gives you insight into the way that we structure our comments, how we actually capture things. So I think alignment between the different groups sometimes can be a big pain point.

I think the other thing is, let's be honest, we're a pharma. We are limited in what we can say. And I think the other thing is the potential constant evolution of court claims that we say with the onus that we always have the ability to be better tomorrow than we were yesterday. So that allows for change.

And when you're trying to do initiatives, like I'm working on now with like modular content, it makes it challenging because you're trying to get to a place where you're like, come on, guys, we have a label. There's only so much we can say. We know this. Like it's in the confines of that label. We should have a core set of references. We should have a core set of our claims, and we should be comfortable with the way those are and how we pull them through.

And the amount of disparity we see from maybe last year to this year of the same claim is pretty amazing across all of the brands because they change, it's a creep. It tweaks little here. It tweaks a little there. In the actual review process, I think the other pain point for my organization specifically even compared to other organizations I've worked with is the use of the tools that we have to review. So we are not fully utilizing the extent of the way the Veeva platform was created to be and the efficiencies that it's supposed to be.

And I know this varies by organization and even organizations I've worked for myself in the past or those that I have colleagues that work at and how they use the system, meaning the system would need to limit lives for view time. We still want to be old folks that we have nothing but like live review time. We have not limited that compared to like an AZ of the world, Radar or Pfizer of the world. And that's by using the tool right by saying, hey, we are comfortable with these core claims and content.

And if I have a comment, I'm going to put the comment in there and you can accept that comment, and then we never have to meet live. The more live meetings you have, the more opportunity there is to voice opinion on pieces? And everybody wants to be heard. Everyone wants to have their chance to weigh in. And a lot of times, you're not living in your swim lane. And what I mean by that is we all want to be on a team and be colleagues, but everybody that you're listed on the left is an SME.

So I don't need regulatory to tell me if they like the color blue. I just need regulatory to weigh in if blue is of a risk from a regulatory concern. I don't need legal to tell me if they like the color blue. I just need people to tell me that we're not getting sued because of the color blue. But once you get into the review process, I feel like everybody wants to give opinions that go outside their swim lanes of being a subject-matter expert in being able to say, "Hey, this is the concern if you do it that way."

#### Tegus Client
Got it. This is something new that you shared. Thank you for this by the way. You said claims.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes.

#### Tegus Client

Some organizations have claims database and maybe some folks have it in Excel spreadsheets. Let's do claims. They just carry into Excel. Some uses a software tool for it. But it sounds like the claims sometimes in the database, they kind of go stale.

And they go stale based on court rulings, maybe new guidance, maybe new interpretation from some of these folks in this process. Even potentially clinical data, clinical outcomes, whether it's anecdotal or actually peer-reviewed studies. But I'm curious, do you find that, that part is,

I don't want to insinuate that it's broken. But what are the areas of like improvement there, though, where as it relates to, okay, we started with some claims, we have some previously approved documents, maybe some studies. And then that's how we kind of go into developing pieces kind of upstream with these two parties, like the product market fit into the record?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes. We have core claims guys.

#### Tegus Client
Exactly. So I mean, these three things here are helpful? But is it, in some way, misleading as things go downstream? Talk me through that.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes. So they're helpful when you're on the marketing team, the brand team new tunnel team and you're developing pieces to say that these are kind of our approved set of claims with the previous materials we've used them in, meaning we've submitted them down on a 2253 to FDA or APLB.

So this is something we're comfortable as an organization saying and the way it looks and feels, the ratio of fonts, the sizes, et cetera, and these are our general list of approved literature or publication sources. These are our scientific sources that we're comfortable that can support this particular claim. And it's helpful in developing it.

What becomes problematic or laborious in the entire process is sometimes, literature studies change. New data comes out, a different, it might be a publication, for example, like vaccines, where the MMWR gets published a few times of the year and they might update language that, in essence, didn't really change what you were saying.

But then at the same time, you have maybe turnover in your legal reviewer, a turnover in your regulatory reviewer, you have a new person on the team. So then they bring a new perspective into that, and that's where then those core claims and literature studies and previously approved materials don't always help because you have change of opinion, change of direction, interpretation that occurs.

#### Tegus Client
So if something existed to improve this process, if you could wave a magic wand to fix it, where would you start? It sounds like maybe just like training the folks here on, you mentioned regulatory. Let's just be really clear.

When you have your limited perspective on this and we need to differentiate between what's your opinion in this PRC versus what's actually going to get you through. Do you see it as a training issue? Do you see it as a tech issue? And then kind of where would you start in improving?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
So I would definitely start with training and if I had influence in those departments. That's part of it in my current organization, other organizations I did and worked with different types of reviewers that some are really fantastic. I would go into a mindset of your role of an SME, which is understand the business goals. And if I bring something to you, instead of just being like a principal, it's where I'm kind of going, no, you can't do it.

Understand what the goals are and say, you can't do that, but I see what you're saying. So here's where I'd be comfortable from my swim lane whether it's legal, compliance, regulatory for you to do that. So that's one. The other area I would say that would help in this entire process, and this goes into modular content, which I think omnichannel has been the new buzzword. Before that, tech engagement.

Before that, it was big data. Now it's mod con. And what I would say would be super helpful is if we could get comfortable with the way we say things and the idea of having previously approved documents. And you could say this is how a statement could be said and here's kind of business rules.

If you say the statement, it's going to carry this balance. You're going to have to go to those things, like whatever triggers go along with that piece of content. And if we can create that and get that out there and everyone comfortable and everyone in an agreement that unless something major changes, we don't change the stuff like this is what we can say, then the review process, I feel, could be very even automated.

You have a meeting to set it up at the beginning, and then you have modules and business rules. And as long as an algorithm runs in the review process and it literally runs and there's check, check, yes, there's business rules, matches, matches, you could skip. And if you scroll down to the bottom of your process, you could get the actual review pieces of this and run it in an algorithm and wind up with just marketing up that sits there and looks at a report. It might be it goes in, editor looks at it, gives this a once over, and this program runs. And then there's somebody in marketing ops or regulatory ops. Usually, a junior regulator that gets ready to do those final steps of the process for approval.

#### Tegus Client
Right. That's an interesting idea. You're saying automation. Why would the automation fail? Like I mean is there a reason why that could fail? Why wouldn't that work?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
What the concern would be, well, the risk. So the concern would be what if. What if when the piece sticks out. If you have modular content, the person puts something together and somehow the business rules and algorithms we wrote to check it didn't account for a certain look and feel. What if something gets tweaked or changed? What if the program just missed others?

#### Tegus Client
That's fair. Actually, it's really bold. I like this really bold idea, which is like, can you even take this whole PRC process out? Or can you automate, let's say, 100% of it? What if you even automate it like 80%. In your view, what would be the savings? Would it be a savings conversation? Would it be we can actually get more out the door? Like what is the ROI?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
So ROI. So the full-time head count you have in a lot of the departments of regulatory, legal and compliance probably wouldn't go anywhere. They might be able to shrink their department slightly but these are pretty strong departments in the sense of head count. So you might see a small amount there. They'd be able to plug in to other work because usually, team members are not just doing just just the parity review of your lawyer. You have other legal responsibilities for the organization. Same with regulatory medical example.

I think where you would see the potential largest ROI would be in this fast-paced world we have of consumer consumption. And when I say consumer, keep in mind, we're all consumers. Whether you're a physician, a payer we consume. We consume content with an attention span of six seconds, and we have a need now. And our needs change rapidly based on dealer stimulation, the constant, all of it ties together.

We are a fast-paced world at this juncture of life due to technology and we expect everything now. If I have a need as a customer and the manufacturer developing this material is able to meet my need now, that could potentially change an action that could then increase business. There's your ROI versus the model of, I have a customer insight or need now and by the time a manufacturer can actually address that need, it's six to eight weeks from now maybe at best.

But by then, my need has changed. So that's where I think you could say that by getting to be faster and the ability to meet that need, which is the whole premise of pharma marketing. We have a customer insight. We're developing a material to address an insight to support the patient, helping to do, whatever it is. If I can do that in a more rapid immediate way, then I'm meeting that customer need, that customer is willing to look at me, hopefully, as a more valued partner. And there is my and the ROI is found in that.

#### Tegus Client
Cool. So how long does this process generally take? I heard you say a moment ago six to eight weeks. Is that always the case?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
So it's interesting you say that. So the actual process between is that like a light blue, purply color versus like the top. The development of the material and updating the material, because that looks at this process sometime, technically take the most time. So that is your downfall right there. That's why mod con is so important. Because if you could actually know what the content is, then you just need to draw pretty pictures and content is being applied through.

When you actually look at it, we're talking about a team that's not overscheduled meaning you don't have issues getting on the agenda. Usually, if you submit into the system, and every company has their own SOPs. But if you submitted into the system today, five business days before the meeting, to say that it's a first review and you need everybody on it, so then I have to wait five days.

So then the meeting is next week, and I walk out of that meeting approved with changes. Depending on what the piece is, it might have to go back to the agency to be updated. Then it might have to go to be built. There might be a tech aspect to it. So you're using your digital production team or your production team's templates. So it's interesting. The actual review time when you put a circle around it, that is not usually the downfall.

The downfall is creating, updating or approving or going back through that review process multiple times. Because that actual process that you're in, and if you actually look at like meeting time, and we've done a great job of removing like the two weeks before the meeting upload time because we've looked at the data and nobody is actually opening the piece until two or three days before the meeting.

So we're able to say, okay, it doesn't have to be. That really is the bulk of, you're stuck on creation of pieces. The actual review time tends to be not long. Now the amount of time, again, you might go through that process, depending on the piece that you're doing, something brand new to the organization, you have multiple reviews. You might have to do a workshop like those touch points. But the actual time in there is still very limited. It's all the prep work to get to that meeting. And then it's the fact of how many times you have to go back to that meeting.

#### Tegus Client
Got it. So if you were to say this is like B, and then this section was A, it sounds like A takes up, would you say, like 80%, maybe even 90% of the time is spent at A? Well, no. I think what you're actually saying, correct me if I'm wrong. It's really just like the back and forth between A and B is what's taking a lot of time.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes.

#### Tegus Client
Got it. Because I mean, if everything kind of went through in one cycle there's like no need for multiple cycles. From what I've learned, it wouldn't take that long. But if you go from A to B, okay, fine. That's like what everyone expects. But if you have to go back to A again because you're already in B, then things kind of get lost.

Because vacations, people leave, the agency may change, the priorities may change, bandwidth contracts or expands. Or bandwidth for the agency, bandwidth for product marketing, bandwidth. Because also, product

marketing isn't just working on one thing, as I understand it. This process is running in parallel. This whole process diagram is also maybe running in parallel like 10 more times or several dozen more times in the organization.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
And we've done things to try to speed it up even. Like there's times that you walk out of the top two lines and you take something and you hand it over to a tech team to start building to a print vendor to start laying out. And then you'll make changes that come out of the review process in that piece. Like there are ways we try to truncate it. So there is inefficiency in the process, which we could speed up. And what I mean is limiting the number you go from A to B.

So that way, you're efficiently going to be and you have people who understand what they're looking at, or again, poor claims. So you don't have to go back where there is minimal changes. But when you have to go from B to A and then back to B, and then maybe get different direction and then go back, it's because of the A process. It's still laborious. A la the hot topic right now is modular content.

#### Tegus Client
Got you. Yes, that's big in Veeva especially. So curious what you think of an idea around something new with this whole process. And you could think of it as sitting between A and B which is sort of a way to prescreen content because, to your point, sometimes, there's just like a few cycles that need to happen before it goes from the agency, even just to marketing internal, to make sure the content is the highest quality level before it even gets to the SME tier.

Now again, the SMEs, getting folks on the calendar for PRC that is its own kind of struggle, but it doesn't seem like it's ever going to change. More so, is there a way to elevate the quality of the content before, or can you elevate the quality of the content much faster? Does that make sense?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
It does make sense. And this goes into, like I said, like modular content or a different way of working. In pharma, so we've been undergoing like an agile transformation in my organization since 2018 to try to get different ways of thinking, be more efficient, be more flexible in our approach. Pharma is not flexible. Biopharma is not flexible, especially the old followers, like where I'm at now with the Pfizers those guys of the world.

So you get a SWAT team of people at the onset in a more on-demand fashion that are very confident in their ability and understanding of the label and are able to say this is what you say and what you can't say at that part at the top before it goes through the process, and then you could completely use and automate a process with business rules because you have some weigh-in at the top? And this is the part that we struggle with, I know here, which is to get those people that are uber confident and experienced they're like the head of legal or the head lawyer that's over all the lawyers that are in PRD.

But when I get in the room there she does like the social media working groups and those types of like governance things. Like super confident and able to go, you can do that, you can't do that, do this. If you had somebody like that to be that SWAT team at the onset to weigh in and give you direction to a more reasonable, feasible, launchable piece of content or piece, then, yes, it should fly through a review process if you could get that kind of consult at the top.

#### Tegus Client
Brilliant. So imagine that black box again. What about putting something like this, where it actually could serve as a consult. Basically getting into the point where the number of cycles with humans is reduced. So I imagine some AI tools that could do spelling, grammar check. You upload your piece, whether it's a photo or a PDF.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes. We use something like that now. We call it PQA, and it runs mostly for ISI, but it does that on our ISI.

Page 7 of 11

#### Tegus Client
Nice. PQA. Is that a part of Veeva? Or is that kind of a separate tool?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Separate tool.

#### Tegus Client
Got it. So yes, trade name and established name mention. Is there a mention of the prop where they use? Are there exaggerated claims? Is it misleading information, URL verification?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes.

#### Tegus Client
So are the URLs on there?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
To update ISI and the spelling and grammar check, that can also be automated. Product mentioning can be automated. I haven't yet seen off-label use. But again, any algorithm, you could probably create to run the check content for certain words. It could be created. But I think that would be helpful. We have something we use now for our ISI, but we haven't gone this far yet.

#### Tegus Client
Got it. So spelling and grammar, ISI, that's kind of the low-hanging fruit. Maybe some of these other ones, even custom rules, such as I like that part you made before, can you build custom business rules. I've heard a lot of folks say about URL verification. I don't know if that one resonates with you.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
I mean at different points, yes. So are you talking about like the link is a live link?

#### Tegus Client
Is the link a live link? Does it actually link to up-to-date information, things like that?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
I would say yes. What would the linking be to, though, would be my question. And the reason I say that is, is it like your PI because a lot of that at this juncture is held, at least with my organization now, prior organization, everything was unique. But now we use a kind of deposit. We have one central location where all of those key documents like your PI, your med guide, your patient guide are stored, so it's always up-to-date. But if it was something that's run, that's what I'm just trying to check, what the URL check would be.

#### Tegus Client
Yes. So URL, it could be the label. So some organizations, they don't have the full label there. You have to include a link to it. So then is that link alive and then you'd go to the right content. That can be tricky, and coordinating that across several teams is also kind of tricky.

But usually, it can be done. So in that A to B scenario, where you are looking at the content and need to make edits, I mean, the concept would be to just speed it up. And then there are progressively including AI technology to the point where it reads the claims. The AI stuff reads the claims, reads the labels and then maybe even looks at custom rules from the organization and then helps someone in quick succession get feedback on the draft of their piece.

So you start a review. You have your promotional piece. Upload your piece. So someone uploads it, engine thinks for a bit, scans it, looks at the business rules, okay, it understands the subject of the promotional piece

you just uploaded. And again, they could have uploaded a Word document, PDF, something like that. It's going to check, okay, they have the trade name. Just could you please verify the established name? It may even fill it in for you, pre-fill for you. That's when you go back.

In this case, let's pick on Tylenol. Tylenol is the trade name. The established name then might be acetaminophen and FDA guidelines make it clear. It would've mentioned it on the page, you have to also include that established name on the page. Label URL, if there's a link to the label, great. Make sure it's there. They upload the file to the label. Some organizations use files.

But this is just to help with the claims analysis to keep folks in the loop along the way. So if there are folks who need to be updated on changes, how many iterations have gone through, things like that. Put people in the loop this section here. If you want a supplemental human review, if that goes well, you can specify the day and time you want, who that individual is.

And then from here, you have on the left-hand side kind of summary of what's going to happen, when you need the document, how many pages this document is and then the summary of the review. It's mislabeling, review, spelling and grammar, competitor product mentions, which you can always mention competitive products. You have to do it in a very specific way. You can't undo client superiority. Any overstatement.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes. I've done it before, where we've mentioned the competitor to carry their ISI and stuff like that and their safety information.

And then you have your ISI checks, yes. And so imagine someone from an agency or marketing has their piece. They put it in this tool that sits behind your firewall. It's not kind of its own separate server. They've uploaded it, they've specified all these things and say, hey, look, okay, here are all the issues in your file. You have some spelling and grammar, incorrect ISI, claims manager that are perhaps beyond the scope of the official label, things like this.

And if there can be teams to review kind of a supplemental lightweight review quickly, I think it becomes interesting because the first version of it doesn't look very promising as PRC. But then they make some changes and upload it again. It's getting better. So on the right-hand side, you're seeing the same document after it's been edited, like a second or third draft, then they upload it again. And then they do it maybe a third or fourth time, and then now it's closer to being likely. Now we may not include this exact language but this is sort of what we're thinking. So how does this resonate?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
I mean I think it would be extremely helpful. I think you would need buy-in from all the other teams because I think like a report that said that brand would be something where the value would be for the other members of the review team. I was talking about modular content because you actually put modular content and business rules in here. And add that level to it, that might be your next iteration of this.

But I think this is something that organizations are just starting to look at. In a sense, like I said, we developed something in-house through our IT that's able to do the ISI checks and that runs every night on every job that's uploaded and opened up, and you get a report. That alone helps. It just helps editorial time. The editor doesn't have to read every single line of it.

So I think that if you could add these additional layers into it and also potentially add even more that you would be able, to the point of running it on your pieces before you go into the reviews and hopefully, the review is going to go smoother or you're going to be able to find areas of potential, pain points that you might go, oh, look at that, we didn't realize that, that could cause this to go back through again. And like I said, when you rinse/repeat in the A part of your thing, it's where the time stuck really happened. So now we can limit that rinse and review because we've course-corrected it before we go in.

Got it. And then the PQA, I forget if that's the right name, that runs immediately? Or does that happen, do you say, kind of in a batch process that may.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Batch process, yes. So once the job is uploaded and then pushed out to the reviewers, it runs that overnight.

#### Tegus Client
Got it. So maybe instead of overnight, it happens instantly. And can this happen in three minutes? Can this review happen in the course of three minutes, five minutes rather than overnight? And can you add more things to that. Can you take in modular content? Can you take in the claims and then kind of synthesize that together and add that to this kind of batch process or real-time process?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Now would this be something that runs outside of the Veeva system or within?

#### Tegus Client
Within.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Within, Veeva doesn't plug into them.

#### Tegus Client
Yes.

And then like I said, depending on where you can iterate and add onto thinking that the new buzzword is mod con. And I know one of the things that we are struggling with here of getting our pilots up and running with mod con is getting to the point of scale of if we're able to say, okay, let's go build or partner with somebody who can do that, but then what does that look like with an automated tool because we're early days.

I'm just throwing that in. Whoever you're working for, put that background sense of what this call, which is if you could then take that thing off then that you're kind of thinking of that would do those checks, is there a way that you could also upload business rules with modular content pieces to also double-check.

So that way, if you're saying, if you're creating a piece and you're talking about dosing and tolerability and you need to also carry the AEs with that, for example, could you upload a business rule and run that, too, for that same probability? I think that also would be like another add-on that would help this be like tremendously helpful because a lot of times, too, our agency partners change over.

It's a highly volatile industry in the sense that there's a lot of competition. And I think generationally, the idea of going and working for a company for 20 years is kind of dead, so we see a lot of transition on and transition off. And I think that's another area that this could help bring consistency to.

If you have new writers, new designers, people just trying to push the bar, not fully understanding where we're currently at with claims databases and things like that, if you could run something that has the business rules that were written by the manufacturer into the system and it's running against that. So we're responsible for updating it. That's also going to help the agency or whoever is creating the piece on the other end, if that makes sense.

#### Tegus Client
Got it. So overall, on a scale from one to five, do you feel like this would actually add a lot of value at some point of view? Scale of one to five, what would you say?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Yes.

#### Tegus Client
Would you give it a three? Would you give it a four? Would you give it a five? Five being truly transformational.

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
What I'm seeing now, four. And where it could potentially go, five.

#### Tegus Client
And then the next question is on a scale from one to five, how warm do you feel your organization would be to considering a tool like this?

#### Director Marketing US Oncology Digital Engagement at Merck & Company, Inc.
Five. So like I said, I'm looking at solution needs now, which I think would be helpful, and then also the idea if you could have this type of tool where we could put additional business rules into it where we're going. Extremely. Because where we're at with our journey in mod con to improve our processes in that A part is kind of the next step, I think, of scale once we get more thought leaders on board because we like to socialize everything here and get buy-in so we have organic adoption would be probably finding a tool like this.

That's why I was like, I might have to take this to the team that's been working on it. Like, hey, you should check this out for maybe a beta where we can see if it would work for our purposes. But I would say, in everything that I see, I think that this would be extremely useful.

And then one of the things I know about Veeva as a whole just because I was an early day Veeva user. So way back and the way, way back, when everyone used Zinc and Veeva was just coming into the marketplace and working with a manufacturer, Shire Pharmaceuticals. And we are one of the first users of Veeva like when they were gaining customers, and we used it for all the right reasons. And so they're a great partner, too, if you're plugging in with them. I don't work for Veeva, but they are also a great partner in helping companies with manufacturer success. If Veeva to came to us and said, "And if you add this much more to your licensing fee, we'll give you this as part of the package," I would say I don't know many companies that wouldn't be like, "Oh, yes, that's a great add-on."

Right. Well thank you so much for taking the time, this was incredibly helpful. Take care.
