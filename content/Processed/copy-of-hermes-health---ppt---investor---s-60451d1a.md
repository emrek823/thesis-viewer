## Slide 2: The Team & Founder

**The Team & Founder**

We tried to build this internally at Datavant post-Ciox merger, but needed to start a new company out to accomplish true vision for identified data.

**CEO & Founder:**
**Alejandro Zamorano**

*   Spearhead record retrieval solutions for life sciences at Datavant (2024).
*   Led Datavant's Life Sciences vertical, scaled revenue from inception (2019 to 2024).

## Slide 3: Identified Data is the Future

**Identified Data is the Future**

**Chart: Data Value Arcs**
*   **$1B:** Patient Reported Outcomes
*   **$20B:** De-Identified Patient Data
*   **$53B:** Linkable De-Identified Patient Data
*   **$200B:** Identified Patient Data

## Slide 4: Why is Identified Data the Future?

**Why is Identified Data the Future?**

Enables insights that drive more value

| | De-ID | HIE / Patient Consent | Identified Data |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Patient ID for life sciences (clinical trials and commercial** | Only counts/statistics. No way to link to real patients. | Shallow data (excludes unstructured notes, imaging, claims history, etc), fragmented data across systems, stale | Full longitudinal record (structured + unstructured, imaging, claims) actionable at the patient level. |
| | **Example Insight:** 2.5k newly incident third-line ALK+ NSCLC patients in US every year | **Example Insight:** 18% of ALK+ NSCLC patients had a documented targeted therapy in their medication list last year | **Example Insight:** 31% of ALK+ NSCLC patients experienced recurrence; of those, 45% were confirmed surgically eligible based on operative notes and pathology reports and we should recruit for trial |
| **Automated revenue cycle & payment integrity** | | | |

## Slide 5: Problem

**Problem**

The industry can't capture this value, however, because data movement today is slow, fragmented, and complicated

**Today's World**

*   **Fragmented:** Many to Many Network
    *   100 million requests per year
    *   90,000 medical facilities ([Citation](https://www.google.com/search?q=90000+medical+facilities+citation))
*   **Complicated:** Retrieving medical entails sending faxes to facilities and then tracking their return. Processes relies mostly on human effort.
*   **Slow:** Retrieving a medical record takes between 30 to 45 days.

**Diagram: Fragmented Requestor-Provider Network**
The diagram shows eight "Requestor" blocks at the top, each connected by lines to four "Clinic" and "Hospital" blocks at the bottom, illustrating a many-to-many fragmented network.

## Slide 6: Why now?

**Why now?**

Now is the time to change this because...

**Market**
Bundling and unbundling of markets - right time to strike as vendor neutrality fades
Other...

**Tech**
LLMs enable analysis of this data at scale to drive insights from raw data
Other...

## Slide 7: Solution: Neutral Middleware Layer

**Solution: Neutral Middleware Layer**

To truly solve this problem, we need a neutral middleware layer that is fast, centralized, and simple.

**The Center - Hermes Middleware**

*   **Simplified Network:** Hermes Health Integrates with Partners to create a simple layer for Requestors to request and receive medical records.
    *   **Diagram: Centralized Middleware Network**
        *   Eight "Requestor" blocks at the top send requests to a central "Hermes - Middleware" block.
        *   The "Hermes - Middleware" block connects to "ROI Vendors", "Claims", "EHR", and "Facilities" blocks at the bottom.
*   **Centralized Analytics:** Streamline data tracking and reporting for both Requestors and Partners.

**Value of Being the Center**

*   **Offer New Services:** Centralized control creates opportunities to offer additional services to both Requestors and Partners.
*   **Better Insights, Better Results:** Understand the flow of data clearly and use it to optimize operations to reduce costs, and speed up access to medical data.

## Slide 8: Long-term Vision

**Long-term Vision**

Executing on this vision creates data network effects that will change the way we think about and interact with healthcare data.

**Our Core Beliefs**

*   The winner in this space will be neutral. Neutrality is the MOAT. Neutrality is our Superpower.
*   Analysis is commoditized in age of AI and demand for data will only increase. We must own data access.
*   Driving access to the long-tail of requestors will create new use cases

**Diagram: Hermes Health Flywheel Effect**
*   **Faster and Easier Records** (top left) leads to **More Requestors** (top right).
*   **More Requestors** leads to **More Record Volume** (bottom right).
*   **More Record Volume** leads to **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume** (bottom left).
*   **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume** leads back to **Faster and Easier Records**.
*   All interconnected in a circular flow around "Hermes Health Flywheel Effect".

## Slide 25: Partners Can't Be The Center

**Partners Can't Be The Center**

**Why Can't Partners Be The Center**

*   **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.
*   **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result they cannot fulfill all requests.
*   **Trust:** Partners don't trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.
*   **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.

**Image:** A group of five people, all looking stern and distrustful of each other, illustrating competitive conflict and lack of trust.

## Slide 36: Step 2: Site Sonar

**Step 2: Site Sonar**

**Problem: Bad Site Information**

*   Patients often cannot recall or accurately name the site details where they received care
*   Medical canvassing is time-consuming and expensive.

**Solution: Site Sonar**

*   Site Sonar uses a patient's PII and our Partner Network to automatically find care sites a patient has visited. Output includes:
    *   Facility Name
    *   Address
    *   Speciality
    *   Date

**Table: Site Sonar Output Example**

## Slide 37: Step 3: Site Finder

**Step 3: Site Finder**

**Problem: Messy Facility Data**

*   Customer-submitted facility details are messy and inconsistent
*   Manually identifying the correct metadata such as release of information vendor, location, fax, etc.

**Solution: Site Finder**

*   Automatically cleans and standardizes facility address
*   Cross-references with Hermes national Site List. If matched, intelligently outputs the corresponding site meta data:
    *   Release of information vendor
    *   Fax
    *   etc.....

*   **Match Found** 95% Confidence Distance: 32 feet

**NSRC Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler (#390)**

**Basic Information**
*   **Site Name:** NSRC Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler (#390)
*   **System Name:** Ochsner Health System (#157)
*   **ROI Vendor:** MRO

**Location**
*   **Address:** 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA
*   **Formatted Address:** 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA

**Contact Information**
*   **Main Phone:** Not provided

**Records Department**
*   **Records Phone:** Not provided
*   **Records Fax:** Not provided
*   **Records Website:** Not provided

**Match Reason:**
Both facilities are located at 1203 S. Tyler St., Covington, LA 70433, and are associated with Ochsner Health. The first facility is listed as "Ochsner Health 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA," which corresponds to the address of Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler. ([ochsner.org](https://www.ochsner.org/locations/ochsner-health-center-south-tyler/?utm_source=openai)) The second facility, "Ochsner Health System (#157) NSRC Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler (#390) 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA," also matches this address and includes identifiers (#157) and (#390) that likely refer to internal designations within the Ochsner Health System. Given the identical addresses and association with Ochsner Health, it is highly likely that both facilities belong to the same health system.

## Slide 38: Step 4: Smart Router

**Step 4: Smart Router**

**Problem: Submission Disparity**

*   Submitting records through the optimal submission path is complex:
    *   Fax
    *   ROI specific vendor portal
    *   Bespoke Integration

**Solution: Smart Router**

*   Hermes Health submits the record request on behalf of the customer by:
    *   Routing directly to its ROI Partners
    *   Faxing validated facilities using our efax service

## Slide 39: Step 5: OCR & Text Extraction

**Step 5: OCR & Text Extraction**

**Problem: Image Based Document**

*   Sites often send documents back that are scanned image of text documents
*   These documents are thus hard to work with since they are not text based document

**Solution: Text Extraction & OCR**

*   **Text Extraction:** Extracts the raw text from the document allowing you to work with the underlying raw text.
*   **OCR:** Convert the image document into a text based PDF. It superimposes invisible ink over the tex making it searchable.

**Image: A page from "A MAD TEA-PARTY."**
The page shows an illustration of the Mad Hatter's tea party and text.

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on
hearing this; but all he said was, "Why is a
raven like a writing-desk?"
"Come, we shall have fun now!"
thought Alice. "I'm glad they've begun ask-
ing riddles—I believe I can guess that," she
added aloud.
"Do you mean that you think you can find
out the answer to it?" said the March Hare.
"Exactly so," said Alice.

## Slide 41: Simple Contractual Framework

**Simple Contractual Framework**

**Contracting & Liability**

Hermes signs agreements with both the Requestor and the Partner.

*   **Requestors** attest that HIPAA Authorization submissions are valid and accurate.
*   **Partners** attest:
    *   That they have the right to release identified medical data assuming a valid HIPAA Authorization.
    *   That they are releasing the correct data for the patient requested
*   **Hermes Health** attests that patient data is securely handled and transmitted to the appropriate party.

**Diagram: Contractual Framework**

| Entity        | Attestation                                          | Liability                                         |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Requestor** | Attest that HIPAA Authorizations are Valid and Accurate | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Submissions |
| **Hermes Health** | Attest that Patient Data is Secured and transmitted to the appropriate party | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Disclosures |
| **Partner**   | Attest that Records released are for the patient requested | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Disclosure |

## Slide 42: Solution: How it Works

**Solution: How it Works**

**First Neutral API for Identified Health Data**

The Hermes Health Unity Platform connects Requestors to a growing network of Partners—including ROI vendors, EHR systems, and RWD providers. How it works:

*   **Secure Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Partners.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Our Partner networks processes these Requests and securely transmits identified patient data back to the Unity Platform.
*   **Delivery:** The Unity Platform securely delivers the data back to requestors without revealing Partner-specific infrastructure or exposing individual Partner details, protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing:** Each Partner is paid a clear, per-record/patient fee to keep pricing simple and aligned.

**Diagram: Data Flow for Identified Health Data**

*   **Requestor** (top) sends requests to "Secure Intake" and receives from "Secure Delivery".
*   "Secure Intake" and "Secure Delivery" connect to "Unity Platform".
*   "Unity Platform" connects to "Partner Route Engine".
*   "Partner Route Engine" connects to "Partner (ROI, EHR, or RWD)".
*   "Partner" interacts with "Facility" (on the right).
*   "Partner" sends "Patient Data" to "API Delivery".
*   "API Delivery" connects to "Unity Platform".
*   "Unity Platform" sends "Patient Data Retrived" back to the "Requestor" (implicitly via "Secure Delivery").
