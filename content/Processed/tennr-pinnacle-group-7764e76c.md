## Interview Transcript

**Client**
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about Tennr, as well as any others that you have evaluated or are used today. Maybe to start off, it would be helpful if you can start just by giving a quick explanation of your background and role and also just sharing some more information on Pinnacle Medical Group and where you're focused?

**Expert**
I'm a 20+ year healthcare executive really on the medical group side, primarily partly working with big hospital systems. Four years ago, a group of us came together to build basically an independent primary care group. Started with about 18 primary care providers, now up to about 30 total PCPs within a geography, six locations at this point in time. We built that group. We're on an electronic medical record, ECW. Obviously, as any primary care group, because you're the quarterback and coordinator of care, there's a lot of things that you become responsible for in terms of coordinating referrals.

Lots of information that comes back to you because you work with specialists all the time. They fax information back. You work with labs, you work with radiology, you work with pharmacies. Unfortunately, because of the nature of healthcare and the lack of interoperability between most electronic medical record systems, the way that most of those documents are either sent out or come back to you is really in a PDF file that's basically an inbox, but it's through really a fax system.

As a result of that, what you find is there's an enormous amount of information and data that is being exchanged and unfortunately that ultimately means that there are people necessary to manage and handle all of that information, which is unfortunately very inefficient, very expensive and hence the exploration into looking at alternative ways to potentially be more cost effective around other better ways to do this.

**Client**
Got it. Makes sense. What is the EMR that you use?

**Expert**
We use eClinicalWorks. Some people call it ECW. It's a fairly common mid-size EMR for a lot of primary care practices. The big two are Epic and Cerner. For most smaller groups, ECW is one of the major platforms people use.

**Client**
Got it. In terms of the referral piece, you are referring your patients to specialists but you're not necessarily getting patients referred to you. Is that the right way to think about it?

**Expert**
That is the right way to think about it. We get a lot of information sent back. Every time, let's say I send information to a cardiologist, the cardiologist does a consult, then they're probably sending the notes back to the PCPs. We get a lot of information flow. We refer out, we never ever get referrals in, if that makes sense.

**Client**
Got it. When you get this information back, you have to load that information into your patient's file in the EMR.

**Expert**
Yeah. The problem really is that the data comes into it really like an inbox in a sense with a PDF file. You would basically have to go into that document, open it up, determine is it information on one patient? Sometimes you'll find in those PDFs someone has sent you back four different patient's information in one big PDF document. Obviously, those documents have to be opened up.

If there are multiple patients, you have to save them into individual PDFs and then ultimately, you're placing them into the right place within the EMR so that the clinician, either the physician or the app will then be alerted that a new document is in their chart. "Mary Smith, who's 69 years old, went see the cardiologist and here's the results from a echocardiogram or something." It's unfortunately that component of it becomes a manual process that either people or now Al potentially can solve.

**Client**
Got it. Is that the only area where you're seeing most traction is the referral piece?

**Expert**
Two-fold. When we talk about purely managing faxes, which potentially is referrals, we actually have a dedicated team just to referrals. There are two groups of staff. This is how it was in the past, we would have a team of staff who will literally just all day long they would just go into the inbox, look at PDFs work and find out what it is. Is it a request for pharmacy referral? Is it specialist notes coming back?

Is it an authorization from an insurance company? It could be lots of stuff that comes in. There's a whole other process. We have a referral team, and their responsibility is that if a patient is deemed necessary to need to go to an orthopedic surgeon, we have people that collect information that the last set of notes, maybe some prior imaging that's being done, maybe what medications they're on, etc. Our referral team have to do two things.

They have to get that referral probably authorized from the insurance company and then the other thing they have to do is send all of the information to the specialist so that they get a good sense of who is this patient and what's happened in the past. There are two unique processes. One is just gathering all the faxes and a separate team. In Pinnacle, just to give you context, that was four or five people doing faxes and it's four or five people doing referrals. You're talking eight to ten full-time employees who really are just responsible.

There is no financial gain for us doing it, if that makes sense. Yes, it takes care of our patients, but we don't get paid for sending a patient. We get paid seeing a patient. We don't get paid for sending information to a specialist. All of that is nearly, I hate to say but like dead cost. It's important, but it's expense in really what's a fairly low margin business in primary care, hence why obviously people are looking at technology to try and alleviate the cost burden.

**Client**
Got it. You said you have people who are only dedicated to the referral data entry and just managing that whole process.

**Expert**
We have 30 clinicians and they're probably seeing on average about 15-20 patients a day. You do 30 times 15-20 patients, maybe 600 patients a day are being seen. Most of those will end up with some form of referral. You in a month will have thousands of referrals that need to be sent out and someone has to do that work in a sense. You end up having to build a referral team to manage that process.

**Client**
How big is your referral team?

**Expert**
They were five people, and the fax team was four and as we grew, went up to five people before we decided we've got to do this differently. You're talking 10 FTEs. If you have them based in the U.S. for us, it probably costs us between base pay and benefits, easily $50,000, $60,000. About $20 an hour. You throw in benefits, etc., it's at least a $50,000 expense. Times it's $500,000 expense probably.

**Client**
You said you have 10 full-time employees doing this today?

**Expert**
I used to, yes. I changed because of moving away from people. Just to know the iteration. We have those people based in our clinics. We then explored an offshore relationship with a company based out of India who allowed us to do it more cost effectively than obviously because most of that work it doesn't really matter when it's done, and anyone can do it. The third iteration was to move to an Al solution.

**Client**
Got it. What was this offshore solution that you used?

**Expert**
You're just using people. In this instance, they were based in India. People we found in the Philippines and India are just really providing educated bodies that we can train them in. We can give them access to our EMR. We train them in exactly as we would train an employee within if they were working directly for Pinnacle and show them exactly what they do. They're just basically either managing the faxes or managing the referrals just the way that we would if we were based here.

**Client**
Got it. You said it was more cost effective. How much more cost effective was that?

**Expert**
We paid about $1,800, I think, per person per month. It was about $24,000 a year we were paying per person. In a sense we were probably maybe halving our expenses relative to having an onshore person. You're still dealing with all the dynamics of dealing with people, working with the supervisor to oversee things. It creates its own set of challenges, but it was at least more cost effective.

**Client**
At that time you didn't have any full-time employees onshore doing this, you completely offloaded this too?

**Expert**
We maintained it, actually. One person for overseeing the faxes and one person for overseeing the referrals. There's some stuff in referrals that you start stuff, more urgent stuff, and sometimes you need to make calls to specialists and other things. There's a little bit of manual, more relational work that you need to do. The bottom line is the majority. Eight of the 10 people in a sense, were basically migrated offshore.

**Client**
Got it. When did you start to think of adopting an Al solution and removing the human in the loop from this?

**Expert**
We were reached out about maybe a year and a half ago now, and really by Tennr, through someone who worked for them that we knew actually in a past life before he worked for them. He'd reached out and said, "Hey, have you ever thought about Al for doing all your back office?" I was like, I don't know if it really can help. I probably didn't really understand Al well.

We began a conversation that led to a demonstration of how the Al could manage the document flow and what it can do. That led to ultimately a financial proposal. We had a physician look at it. We had a person who really oversees the referral and authorization. They came into it very skeptical, because of just the demo and them being able to show us how they can do it. We actually gave them our documents.

They actually took our patient information, and we literally put it into the system, explained what they'd need to do, and then they, in a sense, managed our documents. It wasn't just like a demo. That was their stuff, it was actually our stuff. They walked through, showed how they could read the documents, etc. That's when we were like, "They really can do this." It led to talking about price, cost, etc. Ultimately, did it make sense financially for us to move away from people, into technology?

**Client**
Got it. When you were evaluating them, what were the different processes for this? What were the different use cases you were looking at?

**Expert**
We basically looked at referrals and faxes. We actually started with the faxes as the foundational one because we felt like that was probably the easiest. It's literally going into a document, opening up, making sure you see the patient's name, date of birth, certain pertinent information, and then in a sense, putting it into a chat. It's a fairly simple process. It felt like the referrals was a little more nuanced in terms of what needed to be done. We were like, let's start with the fax system, see if we can outsource that to Al in a sense. Once we got that stabilized and we're confident that it works really well, then we can move on to referrals.

**Client**
What do you mean when you say fax? Isn't the referrals also coming through faxes like you said?

**Expert**
When we talk about our fax system, we're literally talking about four people having to manage an inbox that has thousands of documents a month coming into it from all places and opening those PDFs and putting them back into the EMR. Referrals is an outbound process where you're grabbing multiple pieces of information out of the patient's record. It's a completely different process and team.

They're two totally separate functions. Even though, it does involve faxes a lot of times. It's really sending information out. That will ultimately generate information coming back in. You're correct. Ultimately, that will populate our inbox with other stuff. The referral process is about sending information out, not getting information back in.

**Client**
Tennr helps automate that process of sending the information out?

**Expert**
Yes. It can basically replicate what we would train an employee to do. Say, "When Mary Smith needs to go to a cardiologist, here is the information in the chart that the physician is requesting to be sent." In a sense, it's documented in the chart, and most of it is fairly standardized, last patient know, what medications are on all of these nearly a set of information.

Just think about it, that most of these people, not to be insulting to them, but they're $20 an hour people. They're not clinical people who have high sophistication. It's you're trying to train them on a very simple process and saying, "Grab all of these pieces of information, pull them all together, and fax them off to Dr. Jones, who's the cardiologist," boom.

**Client**
It essentially pulls in that information that they would typically be doing manually from the chart and sends it automatically to whoever the right specialist is.

**Expert**
Yes, exactly.

**Client**
The other use case you were saying was what?

**Expert**
The other use case is all of the faxes from all different sources that come into Pinnacle on a daily and weekly and therefore monthly basis. Taking those PDFs and then putting them as you described earlier in the conversation, taking that information and basically putting it back into the electronic medical record.

**Client**
Got it. When you adopted Tennr, did you evaluate any other similar Al solutions or not?

**Expert**
I just recently looked at a company called Valerie Health that is a similar Al. I didn't really want to waste a bunch of time evaluating a bunch of different vendors because we felt like the price made sense. We felt like they could do it. We knew we had a relationship with the person who represented the company. We felt comfortable. Since then, people have started to reach out to me now. The only demo we've done is with Valerie. A guy reached out to me a while ago, and I was just interested how their system was set up and locked, but at the time, no, we did not evaluate other vendors.

**Client**
Got it. Makes sense. Why did you demo Valerie Health? Was that just because they reached out? You said you were interested, or are they doing something different than what Tennr is doing?

**Expert**
Not that much. One of the struggles we've had a little bit with Tennr, and we warned them about this was EMRs are very proprietary. You need to be integrated fully into the EMR in order to be able to be really effective. It's not easy to work with those EMRs and Tennr have got it set up. They have to do a workaround because they have some struggles. It's really not necessarily their fault. The EMR companies are very difficult to work with.

They can be very proprietary, and it's nearly like they always want to develop their own solutions, but they haven't developed a good solution for that. For some reason, Valerie Health had a much more robust integration with ECW. I was just intrigued. It is meaningfully different in terms of how they're integrated into the EMR, which is why I just take a look and see. They were fairly persistent. I tend to be fairly active on LinkedIn about the frustrations in healthcare. People read my posts and then realize, this guy's really passionate about some of the frustrations of just the lack of integration in healthcare.

**Client**
Got it. When you evaluated Valerie, why did you choose not to go with them and stick with Tennr?

**Expert**
I think just because it was working fine. Really, I feel like once you choose someone and you embed, normally, unless there's some really big reason to change, it's like for maybe a few thousand dollars or an overhaul, it's not worth it. If my team are happy with it, the system is working well. Honestly, why change? You've worked through the challenges to get to that point, it's not really worth it.

**Client**
Got it. I'm just curious how much of the process is actually automated. Is there completely no human in the loop at all or how much of the referral process?

**Expert**
We still have a supervisor. We still have one person because there are certain things that you can't really fully Al. The fax one is easier actually on the inbox because the check and balance of that is that ultimately all of those documents are placed into the EMR, and the physician or nurse practitioner will look at those. The quality control of that is actually done through our clinicians because if it wasn't working properly, and let's say Mary Smith is now appearing in Bob Smith's medical record, the physicians would see that they're putting documents in the wrong place and obviously, therefore it would cause problems.

The good news is that that's not happening. It's a weird quality control process, but because of our clinicians who have to look at all of those documents because they're important to them, they in a sense become our quality control. Not like intentionally, you've got to check all of this. They will tell us just as they would if we had regular manual staff.

They were like, they've put the wrong document in. Sometimes they're split in documents. If they haven't taken all the pages for one patient and put it in the right EMR, you can end up with patient information that's wrong. Like, this page of labs is actually not this patient, which is a concern. We actually thought we'd see more mistakes, but we haven't.

**Client**
Got it. How much time does it take now to actually process a referral versus what it took before?

**Expert**
I think the good news is because in the sense Al can function all the time, you're not dealing with people. Whether a fax comes in at 6:00 A.M. or whether a fax comes in at 9:00 P.M. The nice thing is our inbox is basically constantly cleared out, which is a huge satisfier to our physicians because their fear is when you're using staff is they get behind. The problem is in faxes you may have 1,000 faxes and 900 of them are not that really high priority. One of those faxes is a pathology report of a breast biopsy that is now cancer.

The only way that that potentially has come into your practice is through that fax. Making sure that you're staying on top of looking at all of that information and filing it for the physician as quickly as possible is very important for just good patient care. When we had people, we would get backlogged, maybe 500-1,000 faxes behind. It's not just, "Hey, your inbox isn't cleared out." It's like, no, there could be important information. There is no way, in the fax to know this is high priority or this is really low priority. You only know that once you open up the document.

**Client**
Yeah.

**Expert**
That is why really in a sense Al on top of it all the time, therefore putting it into a chart so the physician can take a look at it fairly quickly and the physician is alerted. As soon as you put a document in their EMR, there's a way in ECW that they call it a jelly. I don't know why they call it a jelly, but it alerts them that, "Hey, you've got a new document that's been put into the EMR. They'll open it up and look at it and say, "Oh, my gosh, this is urgent. I need to call the patient and let them know about these results," or it's nothing and fine.

**Client**
In terms of the return on investment, how do you think about the ROI with Tennr? It sounds like you said you only have one person now, one supervisor, and you had 10 before that. Are you just looking at it in terms of labor cost savings?

**Expert**
It's a combination, I would say. Trade of labor costs for technology and a reduction in total cost as a result of that. I think the other piece of it is really trying to explore. Now that you've got the platform, can you start to figure out even more ways? We have a population health team that do a lot of manual work, now we're exploring how much of that work can actually be done by Al to crawl through the charts, grab certain information.

There's a lot of responsibilities about things like, did they get a colonoscopy, did they get the mammogram, all these quality metrics, and you have to have a team do a lot of this. We're trying to honestly constantly push the envelope. It's like, I would like to see a situation where I have a couple of front desk people, I have a medical assistant who works directly with the clinician, and really most of the other staff.

I know this sounds harsh but have vanished because we can use the Al platform to minimize the use of labor just because it's expensive. That $20 an hour range, the other thing you struggle with is there is a lot of turnover because people get $1 an hour raise, and they leave and they go somewhere else and they're just not quite as reliable. It's a very transient, then you're training someone new.

That's where Al becomes honestly so much more cost effective but also more reliable. People are important to medicine. I don't want to say they're not, but only in certain patient facing roles. The more back-office stuff that you can honestly do with technology. We're low eight figures in annual revenue, just to give you a context. We're not like a behemoth group by any means, but it's meaningful dollars.

**Client**
Got it. How much do you spend on Tennr annually?

**Expert**
Like $50,000-100,000.

**Client**
Is that based on the volume of documents?

**Expert**
The pricing model is like a baseline. Depending on how many documents you process there is a little bit of incremental cost. Even all in it's been around $50,000-100,000. Potentially as we add more functions, we would add a little bit of additional cost. The incremental cost obviously is fairly minimum relative to knowing that one person alone is $40,000, $50,000. It's so easy to trade people for Al in that model.

**Client**
Totally makes sense. If you're spending $50,000-100,000 today, how much do you think that could get to?

**Expert**
I have like six people in my population health team. Six people of $50,000. If I can even reduce a couple of FTEs and move to Al and add $20,000-$30,000 of Al costs for what becomes $50,000-$100,000 of labor cost, it's just an easy math equation. You don't feel bad about dealing with that.

**Client**
What do you think that $50,000-100,000 annually can get to? Do you anticipate it doubling, tripling? How much would you do you think you can eventually spend with Tennr?

**Expert**
Maybe doubling. Anytime I can trade people for Al. I think now that I know those types of systems, if I started another group, foundationally, I would start it without as many people. I have that platform. We've been asked to look at other markets to stand up primary care groups. In a sense I would do it differently this time in that I would have to find the right physicians, etc.

We would start with never hiring people for those roles. We would basically start with the Al, if that makes sense. Everyone in primary care and honestly, everyone who's a specialist, we all deal with same, which is managing enormous amounts of paperwork that we have to use people for. It's very scalable. It's leveraging technology as a more cost-effective path to doing those things.

**Client**
Got it. Right now, what are the areas that you see your expanding use cases with Tennr? I know you're using them for referrals and other tasks.

**Expert**
In primary care we get paid two ways. One is just like a per click when someone comes in, copay, there's a certain amount you get paid from the insurance company. That's one way we get paid. The other way most primary care gets paid is what we call value-based arrangements, which is where for quality performance, for managing total cost of care, etc.

There are payments that are made by the insurance company that are not based on how many patients you see, but more on how well do you take care of those patients. A lot of the work that is necessary to do good population health requires you have to look up patients and make sure, "Hey, this patient's turning 45 years old and they're due for a colonoscopy." All of that work, we can make money on it.

There are people necessary to be doing that work. There is a definite opportunity that we talked about, which is replacing a lot of the people work we're doing with technology. Yes, there's still some patient interaction, but most of the work could be done by Al again. I think as you understand the system more, you start to look at honestly, how many ways can you minimize people and maximize technology.

**Client**
For the population health specifically, you're referring to more related to managing payments with insurance? I'm not sure I fully understood where the use case would be exactly.

**Expert**
We have a population health team. These are medical assistants, who are literally going into charts, gathering information, providing that information. It's like, "Hey, you're coming in for an appointment to see Dr. Smith and you're due for certain things, a mammogram, etc." All of that information has to be gathered by someone or something. Primary care ends up building these teams separate than referrals, separate than faxes of population health people to do this work.

We ultimately get paid additional money for all of this. It is a revenue source, but obviously there's costs associated. What I'm saying is you can reduce the people costs for doing all of that work, and we'll look at changing out population health people for honestly doing a lot of the work through Al. All the rules could be figured out by technology, not necessarily needing a person to do it.

**Client**
Got it. Are there any other areas where you think Tennr can be doing better? I know you mentioned the EMR integration piece, is it just slower to transfer information? What exactly is the difficulty there?

**Expert**
The problem is that most EMRs, even if they're the same like ECW to ECW, they don't share information as data. The only area where we actually get data coming right in is we have an integration with LabCorp and Quest. When you go get a panel of labs, your lab information actually results directly into the EMR, and it populates with exactly the numbers and all the different labs. You would think that's how healthcare works for everything. Tennr wants to halfway exist, the problem is it doesn't work that way.

Most information is still coming in, not through actual data sets. Unfortunately, it's all coming in through these faxes. That's why we get all of our hospital discharges, faxes, someone hits the ER, we get a fax, specialist, we get a fax. The electronic medical records, whether the same or different systems, the bottom line is they do not speak to each other. They cannot share information. Therefore, you have to deal with all of this data coming in, like in just PDF documents, which is why it's so burdensome for clinical groups.

**Client**
Got it.

**Expert**
It's very foreign for someone not in health care. Believe me, it is ridiculous. It sounds ridiculous that in this day and age, people are even dealing with those things. That's why, honestly, people like Tennr have been smart in that this problem isn't probably going away for a long time. Frustratingly, it should have gone away 20 years ago, but it seems to still exist today. Therefore, they're trying to help with efficiency of dealing with all of these documents.

**Client**
Makes sense. If you had to rate your license to recommend Tennr on a scale of one to 10, what would you say?

**Expert**
I give them a nine. They were naive to the challenges of electronic medical records. I think they were young Stanford graduates who were really smart, but they didn't seem to realize that most of these EMR systems were built 20+ years ago. They just assumed, and I understand why. I'm telling them, I know anything about technology, but I warned them. I said, "Hey, it's not as easy." They're like, "Yeah. Shut up buddy? We know what we're doing." I think they were just unfortunately naive to how old and difficult the companies make it to integrate, because that's not.

Technology talks to each other all the time. Unfortunately, that's not the case. That's probably their only misstep. I think they learned their lesson honestly on us because of the challenges they had. They delayed the project by nearly six months for us. For a while, we're very frustrated at them because we actually canceled our company in India and then we had to figure out a solution for another three months because they can't figure it out properly. Anyway, other than that, like, say, water under the bridge now, in terms of how it's working.

**Client**
Got it. How long did it take, by the way I don't think I asked that, to get integrated into your system?

**Expert**
They were sure they could do it in 90 days, no problem, but in the end, it took seven months. The reason was because they had to play with ECW, and they had to get them to agree to certain things. It wasn't necessarily the integration that was hard. It was working with the team to get authorization to approve certain things that slowed the process down. For us, it was seven months. I think now they're integrated. It's a much more efficient process when they're implementing. We were one of the first with eClinical. I think that was part of the issue.

**Client**
Amazing. All right, thank you so much.

**Expert**
No worries. Thank you.

**Client**
Actually, one more question. I know you didn't use them, Valerie Health. If you had to rank them on a scale of one to 10, what would you say?

**Expert**
At least from what I saw and the people I dealt with, I like the guy Peter, who I think is the CEO of the company. I liked what they'd done, too. I feel like they would be a nine, too. If I probably run into them first, I would probably have chosen them over Tennr, but once we'd implemented, I wasn't going to change.

**Client**
How different are they? Are they doing the same thing? What is the differentiation?

**Expert**
Very similar. I'm sure technically, there may be differences. I don't know. In terms of what they're doing it. A little bit different interface setup. I don't want to commoditize, but they are doing the same stuff.

**Client**
Got it. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
