A Better Cancer Journey for All

Time to Care
Lisa's PCP refers her to an oncologist, but there is no availability for 4 weeks. Once she is diagnosed, she still can't start treatment for 3 more weeks.

No Social Support
When Lisa's car breaks down a few weeks later, she begins missing appointments when she can't get a ride — causing gaps in the course of her care.

Acute Care Utilization
When Lisa experiences severe nausea one evening, her provider's office is closed, so she goes to the Emergency Department for care and is admitted to the hospital.

Financial Toxicity
The high OOP pharmacy expenses for Lisa's medications, as well as transport and ED visit costs, start to create serious financial strain and stress for Lisa.

Misaligned End of Life Care
Lisa had received an end of life preferences form before her first oncologist visit. The form was scanned into the chart, but no one reviewed her choices with her.

with standard care

with Thyme Care

Lisa is a 70 year old woman whose PCP has identified a suspected malignancy.

Rapid Access
Through Thyme Care's Rapid Access program, Lisa is scheduled with a high-quality oncology practice within two business days. They confirm her diagnosis, expedite workup and staging, and start treatment a week later.

Addressed Social Barriers to Care
When Lisa's car breaks down a few weeks later, her Thyme Care care partner connects her to a free local rideshare org to ensure she can attend her appointments.

Thyme Care Navigation
Lisa reports severe nausea in her daily Thyme Care symptom survey. Within an hour, a nurse calls to discuss her symptoms, and she is scheduled for a next-day visit for IV hydration and antiemetics. The nurse works with her oncologist to broaden her medication regimen as a preventative measure.

Drug Benefit Optimization
During Lisa's second round of chemo, Thyme Care identifies an opportunity to decrease Lisa's OOP pharmacy expenses, and coordinates with her provider to make the necessary changes.

Palliative and Hospice Care
Given her incurable cancer, Lisa's Thyme Care team encouraged a goals of care discussion with her physician. Palliative care was initiated soon afterwards and ultimately led to an appropriate transition to hospice earlier than otherwise.

What We Do

We are expanding our provider relationships to grow our impact and serve as a competitive moat.

Support Practices in CMMI's Enhancing Oncology Model (EOM)

What this unlocks:
• Additional lives under management.
• Wedge to gain provider trust and embed deeper with their teams.

Deeper Partnerships with Providers
With proven results, we will launch partnerships through joint venture (depending on the market) to enroll oncology practice members into risk-based agreements for their members with plans.

What this unlocks:
• Competitive moat through deep partnerships.
• Enhanced savings through provider alignment.
• Expansion of contracted lives.

1. Lines of Businesses and local markets for national plans are treated as individual deals.

2. This stage typically requires several meetings and is an important part of positioning TC's value to the client. During this stage, we share a market-data driven financial model that illustrates our outside-in understanding of how our interventions could impact the client.

3. During the Opportunity Analysis phase, Thyme leverages the client's claims data to create a financial model that illustrates how our interventions could impact the client. This model is an important input for Thyme when we start to discuss financial structures with clients.

4. This represents a renewal and expansion of our existing contract with Clover Health.
