**New York, New York — December 18, 2025** — [Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/), one of the most advanced AI assistants in clinical care, today announced an exclusive strategic partnership with Advanced Machine Intelligence, the new AI research company founded by Professor Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning and a founding investor and long-time advisor to Nabla. This next chapter builds on LeCun’s early belief in Nabla’s mission and his continued confidence in the company’s technical vision.

Through this partnership, Nabla will gain first access to Advanced Machine Intelligence’s emerging world model technologies, positioning the company to become the first to bring FDA-certifiable agentic AI systems to healthcare.

“Healthcare AI is entering a new era, one where reliability, determinism, and simulation matter as much as linguistic intelligence,” said Alex LeBrun, co-founder and CEO of Nabla. “Yann has believed in Nabla since the beginning, investing in us and championing our approach from day one. This partnership builds on that shared vision and gives Nabla privileged access to world model technology that will complement today's LLMs and help unlock the safe, autonomous systems clinicians need.”

**World Models: The Next Architectural Shift in Healthcare AI**

Today’s healthcare AI systems, predominantly powered by LLMs, have delivered major advances in documentation and workflow support. However, LLMs still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning, and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.

Nabla has long been at the forefront of technical innovation in healthcare AI. Since 2018, well before the emergence of GPT-3, the company has been exploring and operationalizing state-of-the-art machine learning systems for clinical environments. This partnership continues that trajectory.

World models represent the next major shift, enabling:

* Deterministic, auditable decision-making
* Simulation-based reasoning and “what-if” analysis
* Robust handling of continuous medical signals (audio, vitals, imaging)
* A credible regulatory path for autonomous, agentic systems

Together, world models and LLMs form the foundation for the future of safe, actionable clinical AI.

“Nabla has been ahead of the curve from the very beginning,” said Yann LeCun, Founder of Advanced Machine Intelligence. “They understood early the promise and limitations of LLMs in medicine and have always prioritized safety, usability, and real-world deployment. Their leadership in applying cutting-edge AI to clinical workflows makes them the ideal partner for this next phase of innovation.”

**Planned Leadership Evolution to Strengthen Nabla’s Long-Term AI Vision**

As part of a planned, board-supported transition, Nabla co-founder and CEO Alex LeBrun will transition from his role to become CEO of Advanced Machine Intelligence, and take on the role of Chief AI Scientist and Chairman at Nabla, guiding the company’s long-term technical strategy. Delphine Groll, Nabla’s Co-founder and COO, will continue to lead day-to-day operations while the board completes the search for a permanent CEO.

Over the coming months, Nabla will continue to expand its ambient AI assistant, strengthen product quality, and invest in multimodality, simulation, and deterministic reasoning, laying the groundwork for the next generation of agentic systems.

“This is an incredible moment for Nabla, and a natural next chapter in our long-term strategy,” said Delphine Groll, Co-founder and COO of Nabla. “Our mission remains unchanged: to bring the most advanced, reliable, and clinically meaningful AI assistant to healthcare. Our team, our roadmap, and our momentum have never been stronger.”

**About Nabla**  
Nabla is on a mission to restore the human connection at the heart of healthcare through industry-leading clinical AI that optimizes clinical and financial workflows. Its assistant helps clinicians generate high-quality notes in seconds through ambient documentation, dictation, and real-time coding support. Nabla integrates with all major EHRs, supports more than 35 languages, and is used across over 150 health systems and provider groups.

The company is evolving into an adaptive agentic platform that supports a wider range of clinical workflows, care settings, and provider roles, empowering clinicians to dedicate more time to patient care.

Nabla was founded by Alex LeBrun (CEO), Delphine Groll (COO), and Martin Raison (CTO). Its leadership includes Dr. Ed Lee, Chief Medical Officer and former CIO of The Permanente Federation and Laurent Landowski (CPO). Nabla's investors include Yann LeCun (Meta) and Tony Fadell (Build Collective). The company has raised $120 million from HV Capital, Highland Europe, Cathay Innovation, and others.
