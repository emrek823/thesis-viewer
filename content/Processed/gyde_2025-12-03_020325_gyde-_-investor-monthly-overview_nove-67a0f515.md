# Gyde | Investor Monthly Overview - November 2025

## Page 1: Summary

**November 2025**

### Summary
November was another meaningful month of company building and execution for Gyde. We continued to scale our technical organization with the addition of two exceptional engineers who spent time at Oscar and Ramp respectively, and have hired our first Head of M&A, Fredric. We have also formally opened searches to fill the remaining foundational roles across the company, including Head of HR, Head of Data, Front-End Engineer, Value Creation Director, and Product Designer. These hires will expand our leadership bench, unlock our ability to scale M&A and product simultaneously, and ensure we enter 2026 with a complete, high-performing team.

On the product side, we saw significantly above-expected engagement and automation performance in both our MA and ACA renewal flows. Appointment booking rate and auto-renewal volume are all trending well above our campaign targets, giving us confidence in both the near-term conversion impact and longer-term commercial advantages of our agent-led workflows (performance snapshot below). Perhaps the most encouraging feedback has been the glowing reviews we’ve received from broker users. A couple of examples: “I don’t know how I would have survived Q4 without Gyde” and “I love Gyde. Thank you for the service y’all provide. Some of my people believe it’s a real person, that’s how intelligent it is”. We kicked off development on our cross-sell application, which builds on the success and infrastructure of our Renewal agents.

M&A momentum remained strong. We conducted onsite visits for Avid and BenaVest under LOI, and advanced diligence materially across both opportunities. Each is highly likely to close and remain attractive as our first partners from a value creation standpoint. While late-stage deals are not moving as quickly due to the time of year, our broader pipeline also deepened meaningfully: we scheduled 30+ intro meetings with agency owners post-AEP/OE. Combined with our search for a Head of M&A and continued discipline in sourcing, we expect a further uplift in top-of-funnel velocity heading into Q1. We are still working to move Capstone to LOI signature, but expect to get there by EOY. We have one additional target that has accelerated in the funnel, and could sign an LOI by mid-January if we can align on deal structure.

From an organizational standpoint, we finalized plans for our first company-wide onsite, which will be held in Austin on December 11–12, and we secured office space options in both Austin and NYC to support in-person collaboration as the team expands. We also continued preparation for our public launch: we selected our PR partner for the late-January Gyde launch announcement(s) and completed the website, marking a major milestone in our readiness for external visibility. In next month’s update, we will provide more guidance to you around our launch plans, how we are sequencing the initiatives across stakeholders, and where we need your support.

As we move toward year-end and into 2026, our focus remains on:

## Page 2: Strategic Focus and Metrics

1. Finalizing & onboarding key hires
2. Executing diligence and closing for partners under LOI
3. Accelerating product development velocity
4. Generating top-of-the-funnel momentum to fuel pipeline

### Key Needs, Reminders, or Asks
1. **World-class full-stack engineering recommendations**, with a focus on those with expertise in building Voice AI products. This remains a top priority as we increase product velocity, expand AI enabled communication modalities, and prepare to onboard new partners.
2. **Reminder to please avoid any public announcements or disclosure** of involvement with Gyde until the **PR launch in late January**. We will provide more details, coordination guidance, and shareable materials as we get closer to the date.

### Renewal application early metrics

**Gyde AI Renewal Campaign Overview**
*Renewal AI Agent outcomes are trending 2-2.5x above target across Consumer LOBs.*

| Line of Business (Timestamp: 11/15) | Campaign Start Date | Clients Engaged | Response Rate To Date | Scheduled Appt. Rate | Auto-Renewal Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Medicare | 10/15 | 317 | 39% | 10% | 9% |
| Individual & Family Plans | 11/3 | 696 | 36% | 11% | 6% |
| **End of AEP / OEP Target** | | | **20%** | **8%** | **6%** |
| **Aggregate Pace for End of AEP / OE** | | | **50%** | **15%** | **15%** |
| **Expected Performance vs Target** | | | **2.5x** | **2.5x** | **2x** |

**Additional Context:**
* The Medicare campaign has reached a 39% response rate, well above the overall campaign goal we set at 20% (based on industry benchmarks), and the IFP campaign is pacing even faster after 3 weeks of activity.
* We expect response rates to continue to rise with additional follow up attempts and natural urgency towards the end of the enrollment period.
* We’re particularly excited about the auto-renewal rate, which represents a significant amount of time savings for the broker and can be directly invested into driving net new growth.
* The appointment booking and auto-renewal processes are both receiving glowing feedback from design partner and users.

*Footnote: Target driven by talking to brokers in the market regarding what "market leading is"; Will's experience at Oscar, and Sam's experience at Spark; and tied to ~5% growth assumption in revenue model.*
