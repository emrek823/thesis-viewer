### Demetri’s Transition & Personal Update

- Recently completed exit from 30 Madison (9-year journey, announced September, closed October)
- Company fully integrated into acquisition (not division), no longer needed CEO
- Last day January 3rd, first time truly off work since 2017
- Taking Q1 off completely - Dubai bachelor party trip, Mexico for 6 weeks with family
	- New baby boy, 5 months old
	- Wife also has early-stage company
- Planning return to work in April after recovery period

### Future Plans & Entrepreneurial Outlook

- Considering second company (previously sold first company early in cycle)
- 40-50% of ideas still in digital healthcare space vs other sectors
- Prefers building/early-stage challenges over running large organizations
	- Missed product-market fit phase vs managing hundreds of employees
	- Wants to return to foundational building rather than executive management
- Open to healthcare but not locked in - exploring various opportunities
- Plans organic approach similar to how 30 Madison emerged from multiple ideas

### AI Impact on Healthcare & Market Dynamics

- Technical barrier to entry dramatically lowered - can build “good enough” products faster
- Industry buyers (providers/payers) evolved significantly:
	- Initially tried building AI internally, realized complexity
	- Now receiving 20+ AI vendor pitches regularly
- Younger, AI-native founders have advantage over incumbents despite data/distribution assets
- Speed of iteration allows 2-year execution of previously 5-10 year visions
- Market flooded with shallow AI applications vs deep domain expertise solutions

### Collaboration & Next Steps

- Mutual interest in brainstorming sessions during Demetri’s exploration phase
- Virtue team offered research support and thesis development assistance
- Plan to reconnect when Demetri returns in April
- Sean traveling to NYC end of January, Demetri in NYC Tuesdays/Thursdays
- Michelle sends regards, suggested founder-to-founder connection with Demetri’s wife
