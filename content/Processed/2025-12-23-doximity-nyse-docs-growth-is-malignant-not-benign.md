# Doximity (NYSE: DOCS): Growth is Malignant, Not Benign

> Source: [https://www.thecaptainslog.io/doximity-nyse-docs-growth-is-malignant-not-benign/](https://www.thecaptainslog.io/doximity-nyse-docs-growth-is-malignant-not-benign/)

**Opinion: Strong Sell. I am short DOCS. I believe DOCS is not "LinkedIn for Doctors" but "ZoomInfo Targeting Doctors" and it is a predatory business model set to burst in 2025.**

Doximity AKA "LinkedIn for Doctors" is a business in declining health with major risks not accounted for by Wall Street.

As discussed many times in the healthcare professional (HCP) and investment communities, the primary end use case of Doximity among its user base of HCPs is not its social media platform but its dialer or phone number masking service, even as Doximity's revenue largely comes from pharmaceutical companies advertising on its platform in the platform's scrollable Newsfeed.

Doximity's accounting shows peculiar growth. I am diagnosing this growth not as a benign but as malignant.

In a market that has seen significant recent pullback among ad names like Reddit (RDDT), The Trade Deck (TTD), and AppLovin (APP) Doximity is highly exposed.

1) Doximity's revenue accounting and reported business metrics have become a joke. It's very obvious that Doximity is pulling forward revenue on large accounts as their longer-tail customers churn. That their auditor for many years Deloitte seems to be failing to execute on basic account standards shows how out of control this revenue accounting has become under CFO Anna Bryson.

2) Doximity operates one of the most absurd "pre-populated" social networks in existence, in which doctors and other HCPs are bullied into signing up for Doximity to manage their professional profiles else they may have incorrect information about them syndicated to *US News & World Report* and other sources of medical information and rankings. There is major risk in Doximity losing California HCPs and HCPs in other states with laws regulating processes requiring HCPs to upload IDs and collect data off HCPs as a requirement for these professionals to "claim" a pre-populated profile about them. This process has for years boosted Doximity engagement and usage metrics.

3) Doximity CEO Jeff Tangney was previously cofounder and CEO at Epocrates, [which went public and endured the same practices of shifting revenue forward](https://www.law360.com/healthcare-authority/articles/631624/epocrates-must-face-investors-suit-over-financial-disclosures?ref=thecaptainslog.io) as the actual sales of the business failed.

## **Revenue Accounting Biopsy: Moving Large Customer Revenue Forward**

Core to understanding Doximity's game is how egregious their revenue and business metrics reporting have become in recent quarters. Every action Doximity seems to have taken points to increasingly aggressive accounting that borrows from tomorrow to finance today. While this works for a time, when customer spend pulls back the house of cards typically falls.

Of particular note is auditor Deloitte's comments on recent 10-K *Critical Audit Matter* regarding Revenue Recognition for Subscriptions.

![](https://www.thecaptainslog.io/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-10.44.07-AM.png)![](https://www.thecaptainslog.io/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-10.44.28-AM.png)

This practice of sampling only higher value subscription revenue contracts while ignoring full customer base is out of line with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) [Standard AS 2315](https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/auditing-standards/details/AS2315?ref=thecaptainslog.io): Audit Sampling Paragraph .39 which states:

*Sample items should be selected in such a way that the sample can be expected to be **representative of the population**. Therefore, all items in the population should have an opportunity to be selected. Random-based selection of items represents one means of obtaining such samples. Ideally, the auditor should use a selection method that has the potential for selecting items from the entire period under audit. Paragraphs .44 through .46 of AS 2301, The Auditor's Responses to the Risks of Material Misstatement, describe the auditor's responsibilities for performing procedures between the interim date of testing and period end.*

The lack of performance of this PCAOB Standard and basic mathematical standard by Deloitte during this audit unfairly weighs the largest contracts between Doximity and customers while **excluding from the audit smaller and likely higher churn advertisers on the platform.**

Additionally, this change in *Critical Audit Matters* on the last two 10-Ks appeared just as Doximity began to change around their two Key Business and Financial Metrics of:

1) Customers with at least $100k of revenue, TTM

2) Net revenue retention, or NRR

Doximity’s NRR as reported on their last 10-K has declined from 157% to 117% to 114% over the prior 3 years as this definition has changed to net smaller customer churn.

NRR on last 3 10-Ks:

Note the language change on the most recent 10-K that removes smaller customers from the calculation.

The metric definition has changed three times over the last three 10-Ks but in the most recent state the changes do not seem to be retroactively applied to prior years. This metric comes with the disclaimer as of the most recent 10-K that:

*“Subscription revenue excludes subscriptions for individuals and small practices and other non-recurring items.”*

Showing further evidence of significant customer churn issues that have been masked over by only guiding investors to the largest customers is the “Customers Over $100K Revenue” metric, which in recent 10-Qs has changed to “Customers Over $500K Revenue” metric.

Doximity has aggressively retroactively moved this number as evidenced on the last several 10-K filings.

For example, for 10-K for FYE March 31, 2022 Doximity reported 265 customers with $100k+ of revenue for the prior year, but this number was dropped to 254 by the 10-K for FYE March 31, 2021 and again dropped to 251 for the 10-K for FYE March 31, 2024 during which time the $500K+ customer revenue metric was debuted on the 10-K. **This retroactive change of customers reaching the $100K revenue threshold of 14 large customers or 5.6% (14/251) of the now-reported numbers for FYE March 31, 2022** suggests a pull forward. While many other companies may have 1, 2, 3, 4 complex contracts that require retroactive changes in subsequent, this is more significant at Doximity and changing around the number of customers  
  
Further, the $100K+ customers represented 88% of revenue for FYE March 31, 2022, 87% of revenue for FYE March 31, 2023, 90% of revenue for FYE March 31, 2024.

Source: Images taken from the last 3 10-Ks produced by Doximity. There is no possible way that "M&A" alone accounts for all of this roll-forward of revenue of large accounts.

Between the 10-Ks for FYE March 31, 2022 and FYE March 31, 2023 we also see this $100K+ customer number for FYE March 31, 2021 go from 200 when first reported to 188 the following year. This delta of 12/188 is 6.3% of these customers.

During the last few quarterly earnings, this Key Business and Financial Metric has shifted to $500K+ customers with $100K+ customers removed and not reported on.

While this may look like Doximity has signed large new deals in recent months going from 102 to 114 $500K+ customers, remember that this metric is *Trailing* 12-Month Subscription revenue and is backward-looking.

With auditor Deloitte only sampling the highest value contracts in the last two audits, with Doximity showing patterns of aggressive revenue recognition over the last two years, and with Doximity shifting both of their Key Business and Financial Metrics to better reflect only their largest customers, it is likely that significant churn has been masked over the past year and accounting has become more aggressive as deferred revenue runs out of steam - tomorrow has been borrowed from to pay for today but now it is yesterday’s tomorrow.

## **AR Concentration: Tipping the Cards in Hand**

Although in all recent quarterly and annual reporting Doximity has claimed that no single customer accounts for over 10% of revenue in any recent period, one significant aspect that stands out is that on the 10-Q for quarter ending September 30, 2024 three customers represented in aggregate 36% of accounts receivable, net.

![](https://www.thecaptainslog.io/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-7.06.53-PM.png)![](https://www.thecaptainslog.io/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-7.14.16-PM.png)

Source: Doximity 10-Qs.

This 36% represents roughly $45M in AR concentrated among three customers.

While it would seem appropriate here to start calculating Days Sales Outstanding, I don't think that matters given significant the AR concentration. AR is already fairly high. I doubt there are major collection issues with this customer base of large pharmaceutical companies.

By the next 10-Q for period ending December 31, 2024 we can see that at least two of these customers were gone from the credit risk concentration **even as AR increased.**

This game of aggressive revenue recognition can only go on so long as the customers keep coming in, but as we've already seen Doximity is changing around their NRR definitions and moving their customers over X amount from $100K+ TTM to $500K+ TTM and their auditor is only sampling the largest contracts in the revenue recognition *Critical Audit Matter* and seems to be avoiding the smaller, higher churn risk customers.

## Headwinds to DOCS

This space of marketing pharmaceutical offerings to HCPs has become significantly more competitive in the past year.

First, LinkedIn is now marketing aggressively to HCPs and has many more job opportunity listings for HCPs than Doximity.

Second, in 2024, [Formedics](https://www.formedics.com/?ref=thecaptainslog.io) was created through M&A as a social networking and content platform. This company owns the *Physicians Weekly* magazine commonly read among physicians among many other properties as well as Doximity direct competitor [Figure 1](https://www.figure1.com/?ref=thecaptainslog.io), which produces content such as podcasts and serves as a higher quality version of the article sharing one may find on Doximity's content feed. With the acquisition of [AMC Media](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/formedics-acquires-amc-media-group-amplifying-its-content-and-peer-to-peer-hcp-community-302232362.html?ref=thecaptainslog.io), Formedics has positioned itself from the physical *Physicians Weekly* magazine and website to a full peer-to-peer platform.

Additionally, Medscape and Sermo remain two of the top platforms competing for pharmaceutical ad dollars.

With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. heading HHS and promising to ban pharmaceutical ads, there is a large abundance of caution throughout the pharma industry.

Doximity bulls may say that a national ban of pharma ads to end consumers is a tailwind for Doximity as this will create more incentives to market to HCPs directly through platforms aimed at doctors, which could include Doximity. However, on all conversations I've had with pharma marketers, the consensus is that there is a conservative attitude toward incremental spend on anything right now given the volatility that comes out of the Trump administration.

While RFK Jr. has promised to ban pharmaceutical ads to end viewers who are not necessarily HCPs themselves, Doximity has a large user base that is not necessarily HCPs but students who may be interested in taking nursing or medical school programs.

Doximity NP program portal.

Doximity has a large number of students or potential students using its platform and these are people who are not necessarily yet HCPs themselves and thus unable to write prescriptions. This is not common among many ad platforms selling into pharma advertisers.

Aside from merely the volume of students or potential students, Doximity's offerings to these potential future HCPs has come under fire.

[A study titled *Program Misrepresentation in the Doximity Residency Navigator*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10449337/?ref=thecaptainslog.io) was published on August 15, 2023 and researchers found that an overwhelming number of accounts in Doximity's Residency Navigator contained significant missing information, with their sample showing ~42% of accounts in alumni and current resident profiles had no residency listed at all.
