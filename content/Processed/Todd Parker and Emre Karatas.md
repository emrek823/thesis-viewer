### Company Background & Progress

- BioBase Data combines pathology/genomics data from healthcare systems with AI to create federated marketplace
- Team includes ex-Paige AI executives (Sam - head of product, Jonathan - CTO)
- Data partnerships with Quest, Providence, WashU, NORDX, Spectrum Health
	- Revenue split 50/50 with healthcare systems on data sales
	- Additional SaaS revenue from pharma and healthcare sides
- Recent commercial traction:
	- $23k deal closed first month after full-time launch (July)
	- $150k deal closing this week
	- Another $150k deal in 2 weeks
- Current product: AI assistant using LLM to normalize data requests and structure them for suppliers

### Healthcare System Integration & Product

- Healthcare systems fall into two categories:
	- Commercial labs (Quest, Insight Diagnostics) wanting data monetization
	- Research institutions (Providence, WashU) wanting internal analytics plus commercialization
- Integration approach:
	- Manual cataloging of disparate data silos initially
	- EHR connections via HL7 or FHIR (focusing on Epic/Cerner for 80% market coverage)
	- LLM normalization of data structures for faster integration
- SaaS offering: Natural language queries to find samples/run analytics across unified data
- Roadmap: MVP+1 in 3 months with federated nodes connected

### Pharma Market & Revenue Model

- Working with Roche, AstraZeneca, GSK, Lilly, Astellas, and others on pilot orders ($100-150k each)
- Pharma pain points:
	- Internal data silos preventing cross-team visibility
	- No connection between real-world data cohorts and physical samples
	- $80B annual biobank spending, scaling to $180B by 2030
- SaaS model: $25-50k/month to connect pharma internal data silos
- Vision: Three-way orchestration between patients, healthcare systems, and pharma
	- Direct patient engagement (compliant, no PHI)
	- Patient compensation for participation
	- Longitudinal data collection across institutions
- Projected metrics: Net profitable in 3 years with $1.5M revenue per FTE

### Funding Status & Next Steps

- Multiple VCs in data room, one moving quickly with potential term sheet this week
- Strategic investors interested: Sonic Healthcare, BJC/WashU, Cedars, Takeda
- Emre to review data room and respond by Thursday latest
- Company raising ~$2M round with room for multiple institutional VCs
