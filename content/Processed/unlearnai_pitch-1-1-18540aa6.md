## Slide 3: Quote from Charles Fisher, PhD, Founder, Chief Executive Officer

"As a machine learning
scientist at Pfizer, I saw
the potential for Al to
change the way we
develop new drugs.
All we had to do is change
our approach to Al.”

## Slide 5: Slow patient recruitment causes delays in 80% of clinical trials.

Slow patient recruitment causes delays in
80% of clinical trials.

Only half the subjects in a typical randomized controlled trial receive the experimental medicine.
The other half in the control arm receive a placebo and/or another currently available therapy.

| Phase I | Phase II | Phase III |
|---|---|---|
| Safety | Efficacy | Efficacy + Adverse Events |
| 100 healthy subjects | 500 subjects | 3000 subjects |
| Takes 1 year | Takes 2 years | Takes 4 years |
| Costs $7M | Costs $20M | Costs $53M |

<10% success

## Slide 6: The solution: Use AI to generate digital subjects and enroll them into control arms of clinical trials.

The solution:
Use Al to generate
digital subjects
and enroll them
into control arms
of clinical trials.

## Slide 7: $80B

$80B

Biopharma companies invest $80B in clinical trials each year, with little
success. Digital subject data can potentially capture up to 50% of this market.

Better return on investment. Faster trials. More new medicines for patients.

## Slide 8: CROs and pharma are interested in external controls, but Unlearn is the only company creating digital subjects for clinical trials.

CROs and pharma are interested in external
controls, but Unlearn is the only company
creating digital subjects for clinical trials.

## Slide 9: AD Digital Twin Example

AD Digital Twin Example

Age (years): 69
Sex: Female
Region: Europe

Here's an example clinical
record for a digital subject
with Alzheimer's Disease
created by our DiGenesis™
platform.

When a digital subject is
matched to a treated
subject at baseline we call
it a digital twin.
