Data has re-emerged as the critical bottleneck in healthcare. This memo explains why and what it means for Hermes.

## From Data to Insight: The Four Elements

My sense is that data has re-emerged as the critical bottleneck of the AI era.

To frame the discussion, it helps to define how data turns into actionable insights. Essentially, an Insight is a data-driven decision that informs an action. We can think of it as an equation with four elements:

Raw Data: The original, unprocessed data (e.g. patient records, clinical trial results, imaging, etc.).

Organization: The process of cleaning, structuring, and integrating data so it can be used (turning messy records into a usable database).

Analyzing: Applying tools or algorithms to find patterns, test hypotheses, or generate predictions from the organized data.

Narrative: Communicating the findings such as the story or interpretation that makes the data analysis actionable.

When you put these together: Raw Data + Organization + Analysis + Narrative = Insight.

If any one of these becomes a bottleneck, it limits our ability to get insights. Throughout history, different pieces of this equation have been the bottleneck.

## The Old World (Pre - 1960)

In the Old World (before roughly the 1960s), the limiting factor was simply collecting and storing data at any meaningful scale. Most information was recorded on paper (or not at all) and aggregated by hand. Large datasets were incredibly rare, and even basic statistics (like national census data) took years to compile manually.

In this era, raw data was the bottleneck you couldn’t gather or access enough data to analyze in the first place. As a result, data driven decisions were essentially nonexistent.

In terms of our Insight Equation, everything stalled at the very first step: there just wasn’t enough raw data available to organize or analyze, so decisions relied mostly on intuition and limited observations.

Bottleneck: Raw Data

## The Information Age (1960–2024)

The development of computers in the 1960s ushered in the Information Age. During this era, society solved the data collection problem in a big way. Suddenly we had lots of data.

In healthcare, EHR adoption accelerated especially after the HITECH Act (2009) created federal incentives for adoption. By 2015, over 80% of hospitals had implemented certified EHR systems.But abundant raw data didn't translate into insights. The new constraints were:

Organization: EHR data was messy, inconsistent, and siloed across systems. Companies like Flatiron and ConcertAI built substantial businesses by manually curating clinical records. Flatiron for example employed hundreds of abstractors to structure oncology data.

Analysis: Even organized data required specialized tools and technical expertise. Platforms like Aetion and Panalgo emerged to help sophisticated users extract insights, but the process remained slow and expensive.

Abundant raw data didn’t translate into insights because the bottleneck was Organization and Analytics.

As a result, a cottage industry emerged to solve these bottlenecks. This became the core of the RWD ecosystem as we know it today.

Bottleneck: Data Organization and Analytics

The AI Age (2024–2100)

We are now entering the AI Age. My strong belief is that AI is becoming extremely good (and is rapidly improving) at organizing unstructured data and analyzing data at scale. This has profound implications for the healthcare data ecosystem.

AI Organizes Data: LLMs and NLP tools can clean and structure unstructured records faster and cheaper than human teams.

AI Analyzes at Scale: Models can surface patterns, generate narratives, and automate insights far beyond traditional existing tools.

The AI Age thus flips the script of the prior era. Organizing and analyzing data becomes a commodity and becomes essentially a solved problem, the new scarcity is back to the raw data itself.

Bottleneck: Raw Data

Why Hermes Wins

You always want to solve today's problem, not yesterday's.

In the AI Age, those organizing and analytics are increasingly taken care of by off-the-shelf AI or automated tools. The value is thus shifting upstream. If access to raw data becomes the bottleneck in deriving insights, then the players who can unlock data access are poised to become the biggest winners in this new landscape.

We believe that a company which:

Can provide access to vast amounts of high-quality healthcare data,

Navigate privacy

Reduce friction

……..Will win.

Hermes is positioned to be the enabling platform for the AI healthcare ecosystem by removing the data bottleneck that constrains everyone else.

The keys to the kingdom are upstream.
