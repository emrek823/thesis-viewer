# Zocalo - Executive Memo - External

**Investment Memo -- Zocalo Health (Sept 2021)**

## Executive Summary

Zocalo Health is building an integrated care delivery model serving the tailored needs of the US Latino community. The expected care model is deeply rooted in Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and leveraging Community Health Workers (CHWs) to establish trust amongst our patient community in order to improve care outcomes. Virtue led a 2.5X oversubscribed 'pre-seed round' as we believe there is a significant opportunity to build a marquee healthcare brand serving the 1 in 6 Americans that are Latino. Furthermore, we believe now is the right time to build this company type — there is strong industry and investor interest towards health equity and I expect an increase in racially concordant and culturally competent care delivery models and related insurance products in the next 2-5 years. Finally, while we believe the post-money valuation ($12.5M) is high relative to stage / traction there was significant market interest and there were indications that $5-7M financing round at 2X the price would be available.

*   **Company Essentials:**
    *   Name: Zocalo Health
    *   HQ: Seattle (TBD long-term)
    *   Website: N/A (currently in stealth)
    *   Virtue Public Announcement: N/A (currently in stealth)

    *   Financing Instrument (equity, SAFE, convertible note, etc.): SAFE
    *   Co-investors: Vamos Ventures, Great Oaks, Necessary Ventures, Nikhil Krishnan (Bessemer scout fund) and several strategic healthcare angels.
        *   Notably, Vamos Ventures, a venture firm that specializes in backing top tier Latino founders, has known Erik for 3+ years and we engaged Vamos for diligence on Erik prior to financing.
        *   Nikhil Krishnan, a healthtech thought leaders, also engaged with Erik ~6 months prior to the fundraise to pressure test Zocalo.
*   **Team**
    *   Erik Cardenas, Co-founder / CEO. Previously a founding team member and Senior Tech Leader at Amazon Care; was early employee and led operations at health startups WellnessFX and EverlyWell; director, information systems at Tenet Health.
        *   Diligence. We had 8+ reference calls on Erik and were highly impressed with feedback.
        *   Erik has clout across the healthtech and Latino communities. He was previously listed as a '30 Under 40 Healthcare Leader' by Business Insider and was individually profiled by BI ([link](https://www.businessinsider.com/healthcare-leaders-30-under-40-innovators-transforming-industry-2019-10)).
    *   Mariza Harden, Co-founder. Previously Business Strategy Lead - Health & Human Services vertical at AWS; founding member and BD lead at Amazon Care; relevant experience working with insurers (gov't, commercial) and marginalized communities while at HHS, Omada Health and Alere (acquired by Optum).
    *   Background Checks: Cleared.
    *   Fundraising Ability. Erik is well known in many healthcare, tech and Latino communities. As a 1st time founder with a relatively raw, early stage build, I was impressed at his ability to immediately raise a 2.5X oversubscribed round. I believe if we can execute on agreed upon pre-seed goals in combination with the heightened market interest in health equity, Erik has the ability to raise a competitive equity round in within an 18 month timeframe.

Mariza has over 15 years of healthcare and business experience. She is currently the Strategy Lead for AWS' Health and Human Service Business vertical. She owns and operates the strategy to leverage AWS services and partners to build solutions and scale technology to serve the most vulnerable populations in the US. This includes improving the mission critical systems that serve Medicaid populations, state-funded Health Information Exchanges, Unemployment benefits, and other social benefit programs such as SNAP/TANF (food stamps). Prior to this role, she was recruited to Amazon to serve on the founding team of Amazon Care, an employee healthcare program.

Prior to Amazon, Mariza was the VP of Government Sector Solutions for Alere Health where she owned the Medicaid and Medicare Advantage product portfolio including maternal and child health, chronic disease management, and care coordinate which was later acquired by Optum Health in 2015. In addition to scaling and selling the Medicaid/Medicare business, Mariza helped develop and deploy the Omada Health Medicare focused product and launched their first pilot cohort with Humana's Medicare Advantage population.

Mariza started her career in healthcare when she was selected to serve in the special assistant role for the United States Office of the National Coordinator. It was at this time that HITECH funding was approved by then President Obama and Mariza was charged with overseeing the development and implementation of the Meaningful Use program with a focus on Health Information Exchanges. This position exposed her to the many opportunities and gaps to leveraging technology to improve healthcare experiences and outcomes.

Her desire to serve marginalized communities comes from her own experience as a Medicaid recipient growing up with her family in rural New Mexico and current experience helping her family navigate the complicated network of Medicare benefits. Mariza's parents are first generation US Citizens with her grandparents immigrating to the US from Monterrey, Mexico.

Mariza attended the University of New Mexico where she received an undergraduate degree in Sociology & Political Science.

Mariza left New Mexico when she was admitted into the Health Policy program at George Washington University. She was awarded a Master's Degree in Public Health (MPH) in 2010. The first in her family to hold a master's degree.

*   **Market Overview:**

## Market Size

| Category             | Spend (USD)       | Members           |
| :------------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| U.S. annual health spend | ~$3.8 trillion    |                   |
| Medicare             | $799 billion      | 68.7M members     |
| Latinos on Medicare  | $111.8 billion    | 6M members        |
| Medicaid             | $613 billion      | 52.4M members     |
| Latinos on Medicaid  | $85.8 billion     | 17M members       |

*   US Latino market size is significant – 1/6 Americans are Latino and the US Latino economy, on its own, represents the 8th largest economy in the world and largest Latino market size in the world. As of 2018 the US Latino economy was measured at $2.6T (up from $2.3T in 2017).
*   As of 2019, there were ~60.6M Latinos in the US, up 930K from 2019 and up from 50.7M in 2010. Between 2010 and 2019, the Latino share of the total U.S. population increased from 16% to 18%. Latinos accounted for about half (52%) of all U.S. population growth over this period ([link](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2020/07/07/hispanic-population-growth-in-u-s-continues-to-be-driven-by-births-not-immigration/)).
    *   This is a rapidly growing demographic with an anticipated increase to 30% of the overall population by the year 2050.
*   Despite currently making up ~18% of the population, the LatinX population accounts for nearly 1/3rd of all Medicaid enrollees.
*   And roughly 25% of the entire Latino population is concentrated in ten geographies, often accounting for over 50% of that geographies total populations.
*   **Macro Trends & Tailwinds / Why Now?**
    *   We believe the emergence of 'Health Equity' is not a fad and here to stay. Specifically, we expect that care delivery models orienting to a general population will gradually give way to more tailored care delivery models specific to conditions, personas and communities of interest. Furthermore, it is our belief that racially concordant + culturally competent care delivery models will increase in prominence as a result where care delivery model inputs and stakeholders are reflective of the specific community being served. Additionally, Health Equity along with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts have gain considerable momentum across our society.
    *   For instance, CMS recently announced that Health Equity is a key priority in the coming decade suggesting that reimbursement coverage will improve and expand for historically underserved communities and minorities.
    *   And, increasingly more so the venture community is allocating more capital to companies led by diverse teams and/or those directly serving underrepresented and marginalized communities.
    *   Cityblock. Our most direct market comp is Cityblock, a similar integrated care delivery model serving underrepresented and marginalized communities. Having been formed in 2017, Cityblock was recently valued at ~$5.7B by SoftBank (as of Sept 2021). While we believe this price is high, we also see the rise of Cityblock as a significant bellweather for culturally competent care delivery models and the Medicaid market.
*   **Product**
    *   The Zocalo product is likely to be an integrated care delivery model deeply rooted in SDOH considerations to foster patient trust, bilateral communications and reporting, and improve care outcomes. It is not yet known if the Zocalo care delivery model will be primary care model or an extension to existing primary care practices.
    *   Our early thesis is that community health workers (CHWs) will be a necessary and lead contributing factor toward the Zocalo care model. CHWs, in particular, are likely to be essential toward fostering Latino community/user trust and acquiring non-clinical information (e.g. social, family, behavioral, community) that is deeply valued by provider systems and payers. The CHW, in many ways, will serve as the community data conduit into a CRM-like abstraction layer that sits on top of the EMR and complements traditional clinical personal healthdata inputs.
    *   The CHW-led care model is in contrast to the Cityblock model that leverages social workers in a similar capacity. Furthermore, we believe a CHW-led integrated care team will create a lower cost model to service our targeted Latino communities and at scale can be a competitive advantage when competing against PCP and/or specialist-heavy care models given how inexpensive CHWs are relative to licensed clinicians.
    *   The CHW role, we believe, will also be vital to extract
*   **Business Model**
    *   While the business model is still not yet determined, and will be a function of end user and care delivery model, we believe that Zocalo will likely monetize via revenue share of capitated payment models and/or a per employee per month (PEPM) selling into employers that have a disproportionate share of Latino employees.
    *   While we do not expect to enter into any risk-bearing arrangements during this pre-seed phase we believe there is an opportunity to structure these arrangements with Managed Medicaid plans as well as risk-bearing provider entities.
    *   I have personal experience partnering with early stage care delivery models — it is normal for the business model to remain undefined for at least 6-12 months post initial financing and until the care model is defined.

## Strengths:

*   **Team Upside.** I have been impressed with Erik's ability to mobilize support and interest from leading practitioners and industry leaders. Furthermore, we conducted many founder references (8+), on and off-sheet, which were very strong. Mariza offers a complementary skillset and we believe that the existing management has shown strong potential to raise future capital and attract high quality future team members.
*   **Massive, Untapped Market Category with Relevant Comps.** The US Latino market is massive and still relatively untapped without a marquee healthcare brand associated. While early startup incumbents such as ConsejoSano have demonstrated market appetite for a Latino-focused care management product, we believe it is necessary to also deliver care uniquely tailored to the Latino market. Furthermore, we anticipate cost acquisition advantages related to hyper marketing targeting strategies at specific communities we are serving and network effects within large Latino households and family networks.
*   **Health Equity / Financing Market Interest.** There has been a considerable push towards Health Equity in the last 24 months which has recently been accelerated by government mandates (e.g. CMS push towards health equity, Medicaid), successful market comps (e.g. Cityblock valued at >$5.5B largely serving a Medicaid market) and cultural trends (e.g. BLM).

## Risks:

1.  **Unproven Management Team / 1st Time Founders.** While we are excited to partner with Erik and Mariza, both proven operators, they are both 1st-time founders and it is critical that we closely manage in the initial 3-6 months. I have already established a close working relationship with Erik (weekly calls + near daily communications) to ensure early company foundation is built in a solid and sound fashion.
2.  **Care Model a Work-In-Progress.** While we are bullish on deploying a tailored CHW-led care model to serve specific needs of the US Latino community, there is little real world evidence to support efficacy at scale. To be clear, we do not see this as a concern but instead an opportunity to demonstrate a new care model with a differentiated clinician and cost structure.
3.  **Commercial Strategy Unclear.** Given the current undefined state of the care model it is unclear what the optimal commercial strategy and near-term GTM is. We anticipate initial adoption with the payer segment seeking to optimize utilization amongst its Latino members as well as have improved visibility into this community and general healthcare utilization behavior. Our early feedback from both payers, as well as providers seeking to extend care into the Latino community, has been positive but we have not yet determined exact business model and sales strategy.

## Conclusion

*   There is a clear and present need for a company that is dedicated to serving the Latinx community in a way that resonates with the particular and specific needs of this population and build the marquee health delivery brand for the Latinx community.
*   Zocalo is tackling a massive addressable market opportunity of ~$200B in annual Latino healthcare spend, a portion of which is currently occurring in an inefficient, low-value manner due to the unique characteristics of this population.
*   To be successful, Zocalo will need to build novel mechanisms to provide high-value community, social and clinical care, likely enabled by trusted community members (promotors de salud), and do so in a way that facilitates and builds trust within the community.
*   Lastly, we believe strong that Zocalo must and will attract an experienced, capable leadership team that understands the intricacies of this population AND the nuances of the healthcare delivery system in the US AND identifies with the Latino community.
