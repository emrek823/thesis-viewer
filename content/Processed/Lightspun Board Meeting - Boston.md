### Commercial Performance & Investor Concerns

- Investor frustration that we’re consistently not hitting quarterly sales/commercial goals
- Haven’t hit projections in any of the last 4-5 quarters
- Currently at ~$3M ARR vs projected $7M+ for end of year
- Pattern of constantly projecting downwards after missing targets
- Need better forecasting accuracy and more realistic timelines
- Lack sufficient pipeline coverage for ambitious goals

### Revenue Update & Key Wins

- Added $910k in new contracts since Q3: FCL ($840k) and Guardian ($70k)
- Lost 3 customers due to external factors:
	- Better Care: Lost Massachusetts Medicaid contract (2.2M members)
	- MB2 & Jefferson: High-touch DSO implementations failed
- Current focus on converting pipeline to reach $7.7M by Q2
- Major opportunities: CAQH ($3M), Guardian expansion ($800k), 11th Health ($450k), ProMedica ($500k)

### CAQH Medical Expansion Opportunity

- $3M+ contract opportunity to expand from dental to medical credentialing
- Would handle 300k healthcare providers vs current 33k dental providers
- Requires 3-month development investment (8 people) plus 15-20 ops staff
- Key differences from dental: 25+ medical specialties vs 5 dental, foreign medical graduate verification
- Non-competitive opportunity - CAQH approached directly
- Potential strategic partnership beyond just client relationship
- Board consensus: Pursue aggressively given scale of opportunity

### Sales Process & Customer Segmentation Analysis

- Most success with small-medium payers (FCL model): CEO-direct approach, clear ROI cases, fast decision-making
- Struggling with consensus-driven large enterprises (Guardian, ProMedica): 30+ people involved, 18+ month cycles
- Need to focus on fast-cycle opportunities vs long enterprise sales
- DSO challenges: High turnover, not tech-savvy, prefer managed services over SaaS
- ADA relationship providing better payer access than small practice opportunities

### Team Changes & Talent Challenges

- Akhil departing to start own company - significant loss of high-performing talent
- Struggling to recruit top-tier US engineering talent: culture fit issues, geography challenges
- Building hybrid office in Bangalore (6-7k/month) to improve collaboration
- Russell Evans potential hire discussion: Strong relationships but concerns about team management capability
- Bill Henderson advisor discussions ongoing

### Strategic Focus & Resource Allocation

- Rejected Maguire Institute clinical AI opportunity - too many competing priorities
- Board emphasizes need to focus on core modules vs exploring adjacencies
- Resource allocation debate: Product development vs sales/go-to-market investment
- Need to build sales muscle with dedicated outreach and pipeline development

### Legal Update

- Overjet lawsuit: Judge questioned lack of demonstrable harm in their complaint
- Settlement discussions scheduled for January 22nd with Overjet head of strategy
- Willing to return equity stakes but won’t accept non-compete restrictions

### Next Steps

- CAQH: Sign POC contract within 30 days, prove platform scalability
- Sales hiring: Open retained search process concurrent with advisor discussions
- Focus on mid-size DSO segment and payer opportunities through ADA relationship
- Deliver on signed contracts: Planam, FCL, ProMedica implementations
