### rMarket Segmentation & Strategy

Small Group Market (≤250 members)

- Keen to go forward first; more responsive than larger companies
- Rate is primary value proposition for smaller groups
- Small groups prioritize fixed costs vs. variable costs
- Opening up rate particularly interesting for 250 members and smaller

Large/Jumbo Market

- Primary concern is cost certainty, not rates
- Drugs represent biggest variable cost on balance sheet
- Carriers focus more on drug spend than with small groups
- Larger groups = aggregated risk; care more about surplus than rates
- Can rate shop due to law of large numbers
- Direct RFP process through brokers

### Distribution Strategy

1000+ Employee Groups = PBM Channel

- Selling through PBMs for larger groups
- SaaS platform with performance upside
- If sales exceed SaaS fee, take percentage instead
- Semi-annual reconciliation structure
- Platform tied to risk makes upside uncapped
- Ventegra first PBM to buy product as SaaS offering
- MedImpact CCO meeting scheduled - likely exploring acquisition angles

<1000 Employee Groups = Broker Channel

- Must sell through rate advantages
- Brokers currently capturing excessive margins
- IOA (8th largest broker) wants nationwide deployment

### Business Model Innovation

Customer/Buyer Dynamic

- More customers than buyers in market
- Similar to Sam’s trial-based approach vs. flat platform fee
- PBMs understand PMPM guarantee value but lack capability
- At scale, lives flowing through platform create leverage

Rebate Strategy

- Working to coin term for rebate aggregation
- Requires rebates flow through RightWise for cost certainty
- Will expose rebates never reaching employers
- No incentive to retain rebates unlike current players

### Financial Projections & Growth

- Conservative 2025 end-of-year target: $5M ARR
- Growth drivers:
	- Essential/Optimal suite taking off
	- PMPM guarantees gaining traction
	- RxProtect steady
	- SaaS contracts with upside paying off in 2026
- Major revenue acceleration expected in 2026

### Competitive Landscape

- Expect business-adjacent competitors vs. direct PBM competition
- Most VCs struggle understanding risk-based platforms
- Market misconception: Need sourcing from “Botswana” vs. addressing fraud
- CapitalRx analysis:
	- NADAC pricing higher than AWP
	- Hidden margins in admin fees
	- Direct group billing vs. claim-based
	- Maintaining pill-level margins

### Product Development

- Focus areas:
	- Super claimant modeling ($60K+ claims)
	- Sophisticated modeling methodologies
	- J-code underwriting capability
	- Workflow optimizations
	- Input/output mapping improvements
	- Feature set organization

### Strategic Evolution

- Key changes past 6 months:
	- Half-assed guarantees more common than expected
	- Strong resonance of PBM panel discount concept
	- Market size realization: $500M-$1B potential vs. initial $250M estimate
	- Now informing 70-80% of carrier margin

### Financing Strategy

- Considering two options:
	- $5M now + $20M in 2026
	- $10-15M now with no further raises
- Leaning toward larger single raise
- Current interest from:
	- T Cap
	- Maverick
	- GPV
	- Health Velocity
- VCs understand subscription model but struggle with PMPM guarantee concept
- Kinley likely to reinvest

### Key Risks

- Exposure reduction through scale
- PBM self-service attempts
- Market-adjacent competition
- Brand protection as trusted auditor
