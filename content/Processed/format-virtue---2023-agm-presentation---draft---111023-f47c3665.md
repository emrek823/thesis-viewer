Annual General Meeting (AGM)
11.16.2023

## Slide 2: Executive Summary
### A Maturing Strategy: Performance Mapping to Expectations

*   **Year 2 Challenges & Response.** Successfully addressed key challenges such as LP secondary transaction (1/3rd of AUM), SVB Crisis & ongoing reverberations and a correcting market environment that has directly impacted portfolio construction & asset selection strategies.
*   **Investments / Portfolio Developments.** We have made 17 investments total, leading 11, with an overall 6.38% avg weighted ownership. We have had five (5) markups; majority of current cost exposure (~60%) associated with portfolio companies that have >24 months runway.
*   **Investment Schedule.** We are currently on pace for a 3.5-4 year investment period (H1-25). Total cost exposure to date = $15,262,221 (or 48.8% of $31.25M AUM).
*   **Maintaining Core Strategy.** We see continued evidence that our sector-stage strategy is working, and, importantly, we have not deviated from our original core sector-stage strategy.
*   **Fund II Prep.** We anticipate formally raising a $50M Fund II in Jan 2024; we are currently prioritizing Fund I LP commitments for Fund II (already received multiple verbal commitments).

## Slide 3: Year 2: Challenges & Lessons Learned
### Testing Our Resolve and Demonstrating Resilience

Q2-23 "HEADACHE"

*   **Replacing Previous Anchor via LP Secondary.** In Mar-23 our prior anchor ($10M or ~1/3rd of the fund) indicated an unexpected need to sell for reasons not specific to Virtue. Over the course of Q2-23 we successfully transacted the full $10M to a largely institutional, long-term LP base.
*   **SVB Crisis.** In the immediate wake of the SVB crisis we quickly supported portfolio companies to protect their cash balances & establish multi-banking treasury strategies. Virtue also established a similar multi-bank strategy.
*   **Market Correction.** In 2023 we have witnessed a decline in overall pipeline opportunities (quantity + quality) which has prompted creative and aggressive strategies that maintain our regular investment cadence while improving entry ownership and not compromising on quality standards.

## Slide 15: Portfolio: Sourcing
### Executing Multiple Sourcing Strategies to Capture Market Dislocations

*   **Outbound Rooted Culture.** Active outbound; best founders choose their investors; identify elite founders addressing market dislocations we value. (Example: WriteWise, mural health)
*   **Develop Inbound Signal.** Actively signal to key market participants (VCs, founders, etc) areas of investment we are prioritizing to remain top of mind. (Example: WriteWise, mural health)
*   **Cultivate Founder Candidates.** Capitalize on human capital networks within healthcare sector in order to build trusted relationships with potential founders well before a fundraise.

### A Quick Breakdown of Current Portfolio

*   Emphasis on **Valuation** (<$12M post) + **Ownership** (>7%) + **Quality** (Would this investment immediately be in top 1/3rd of the current portfolio?).
    *   **Ownership Goal.** >6% avg aggregate ownership (upfront) by portfolio end.
    *   **Rule of Thumb.** Conviction that any new investment can return the fund.
    *   **Sufficiently Capitalized.** New investments have runway though 2025-26.
    *   **Avoid Adverse Selection.** Optimize exit value > entry optics.
    *   **Reserves.** Optimize 'first check' strategy and reduce reserves to ~15%.

## Slide 20: Current Market Observations
### Juxtaposing External Market Sentiment Against Internal Action

*   **Healthcare Funding On Historical Trend.** 2023 total funding levels will likely land at ~$10-$12B after 4 of last 5 quarters for digital health funding were in the ~$2B range. However, despite the 60-65% drop from a peak of $29.2B in 2021, we are only slightly below what historical 2014-19 CAGR would imply and >6X the 2012 total funding levels when our ‘health tech’ category was formed.
*   **Investor-Side Correction.** Prominent multi-stage firms retrenching to Series A/B rounds while generalists are leaving healthcare (71% of 2023 healthcare deals have been done by repeat healthcare investors).
*   **Evolving Series A ‘Capital Risk’.** Important that we remain cognizant of certain verticals/areas that are currently in/out of favor with Series A investors (e.g. biopharma SaaS vs care delivery / D2C). We are less concerned with growth market sentiment (>3-5 years post our investment).
*   **Likely Survivorship Bias.** As seed deal volumes decline & prices remain stubbornly high and Series A graduation rates drop, it would suggest that the select companies who raise Series A in '23-25 will stand out in growth markets over the subsequent years.
*   **Immediate Offensive Opportunities.** Objectively, it seems like ideal time to be greedy while others are fearful.

## Slide 23: Healthcare Macro Trends
### Zooming Out: Secular & Structural Needs-Based Tailwinds

*   US healthcare expenditure is expected to reach >$7T (trillion!) by 2031, representing a 5.4% CAGR. At this rate US healthcare expenditures will represent 20% of overall GDP within the next 7.5 years (vs ~17.3% in 2023). Medicare spending growth forecasted at 7.8% during the 2025-2031 period.
*   Between 2005-2021 the US healthcare labor productivity rate was only ~0.5%. In comparison, other sectors registered the following labor productivity rates: info/tech (5.5%), finance/insurance (1.5%), etc. The overall US labor productivity rates during 2005-19 was 1.1%.
*   As the AI innovation sector explodes, the vast majority of the global data volume (~30%) can be attributed to healthcare specific data and, importantly, upwards of ~80% existing healthcare data is either semi-structured or unstructured data and currently unused; and, growing at a 36% CAGR by 2025 (10% faster than financial services).
*   In the US the demographic share of individuals above the age of 65 is increasing while our birth rate continues to decline. And, by 2030 it is expected that there will be 83.4M million polychronic Americans (individuals with 3 or more chronic conditions) compared to only 30.18M in 2015.

**TAKEAWAY:** Driving productivity gains within just the US healthcare sector represents a multi-trillion dollar opportunity that Virtue is addressing.

### Relevant Non-Investment Considerations for Virtue LPs

*   **Future Capital Calls.** Due to higher interest rates applied to our LOC it is likely that we may have more frequent but smaller sized capital calls on a go-forward basis in order to minimize LOC interest rate associated fee payments.
*   **Assessing New Private Fund Rules for US ERAs.** We are actively taking stock of potential impact due to the recently enacted Private Fund Restricted Activities Rule (Rule 211(h)(2)-1) & Preferential Treatment Rule (Rule 211(h)(2)-3) which will impact Virtue beginning Q1-25 (3.14.25). Expect increased compliance costs.
*   **Banking Partners.** We currently bank with First Citizens (SVB) and Keystone Bank which holds <15% of LP & mgmt fund accounts. Currently exploring HSBC as additional partner and/or replacement to SVB.

## Slide 26: Fund II Preparation
### Executing Original Vision of Our Multi-Fund Strategy

*   **Fund II Target = $50M.**
*   **Strategy Update.** Our sector/stage strategy will remain unchanged however expect a more concentrated portfolio with larger upfront ownership (10-20%).
*   **Launch Date.** Jan 2024. Fund II likely 'activation date' in Q4-24.
*   **Prioritizing Current LP Participation in Fund II.** We are prioritizing Fund I LP participation in Fund II in order to secure your allocation and we are currently accepting Fund II commitments exclusively from Fund I LPs.

## Slide 31: Hospitals lose money when patient care is not correctly captured Most of this is not coding – but rather missed documentation.

*(Diagram illustrating the flow)*

**Input:** High-dimensional record of clinical actions
*   Labs
*   Meds
*   Orders
*   Vitals
*   Flowsheets
*   Nursing
*   Radiology
*   Pathology

**(CDI)** -> Notes (Unstructured summary) -> **Coding** -> ICD-10 (Structured summary) -> **AR** -> $ (1-dimensional value)

## Slide 32: Trying to detect the absence of documentation is hard. Our AI-first approach converts this to a simple 'agree' or 'disagree'.

*(Visual analogy: "Where's Waldo?" puzzle)*

**Left Side:**
*   Low reliability
*   Low speed

## Slide 38: Market Problem – Why No Insurance Product Exists to Contain Medical Costs

*   **PHARMACY CLAIMS COST DOES NOT HAVE A SEPARATE MANUAL** – the experience is tied to the medical manual and assigned proportionally (70/30 medical/pharmacy against total cost).
*   Generic and brand drugs are colinear to medical spend, but **SPECIALTY DRUGS ARE THE INVERSE IN COST TO MEDICAL COST** due to the chronic nature of the diseases they mitigate.
*   The inverse cost is not proportional – **THE DRUG COSTS 20X THE REDUCTION IN MEDICAL COST.**
*   If specialty drug claims volume is greater than 2% of total claims and/or greater than 50% of the cost of all drugs **THE LOSS RATIO FOR THE MEDICAL PLAN WILL BE >100%.**

**YOU NEED EXPERIENCE ISOLATED TO PHARMACY, AN ESTIMATION OF FUTURE TREND INDEPENDENT OF MEDICAL RISK, AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF DRUG COST NET OF REBATES TO UNDERWRITE A PHARMACY CARVE OUT.**

## Slide 39: Massive addressable market opportunity

**U.S. group health insurance market size**

*   **156 million** people in the U.S. (**55.4% of population**) with employer-based group health insurance.
    *   Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2021
*   **~ $2.1 trillion** in annual premiums.
    *   Source: Kaiser family

**WriteWise INITIAL OPPORTUNITY: Self Funded Employers**

*   **Self Insured Health Benefits**
    *   61% of workers on partially or fully self funded plans
    *   **$1.3 trillion** in annual healthcare spend
        *   (i) ~$400 billion to cover the pharmacy portion only.
*   **Pharmacy stop loss + level funded SAM**
    *   **~ $100 billion**
    *   Significant opportunity for initial WriteWise product

## Slide 40: Pharmacy Only Stop Loss: A New and Attractive Product For Cost-Conscious, Self-Insured Groups

*   **CARVE OUT PHARMACY FROM MEDICAL PLAN** with separate premium pricing (net premium costs lower)
*   **WILL WRITE ANY BUSINESS** (PEO, GOV ENTITIES.....)
*   **CAN BE BUNDLED WITH BOTH SUPPLEMENTAL AND INDEMNITY COVERAGE** for disease specific drug costs (autoimmune, rare disease, etc.)
*   **LEVEL FUNDED COVERAGE** – returns surplus to the group or offers protection on cost escalation long term
*   **COVER ALL DRUGS EXCEPT INPATIENT J CODES** (which fall under medical plan)
*   **FOCUSED ON >100 GROUPS** to minimize single drug specialty risk

## Slide 41: Platform Built On Data Advantage and RX Value Chain
### "RX GUARANTEE" PROGRAM

**Data Edge: Predictive Formulary**

*   LLM driven understanding of expected drug utilization by drug type and class
*   Upfront cost containment with maximum choice and minimal prior authorization process

**RX Edge: Specialty Cost Mitigation**

*   International sourcing w/ contracted pharmacies
*   Domestic sourcing with embedded 340 B pricing
*   Non-profit PBM rates with exclusive partner

**Unique value proposition**

*   Level funding provides predictability

## Slide 42: Repricing Example – Impactful Cost Levers

|                            |                                |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Incumbent PBM Cost         | $ 27,536,823.48                |
| Lever 1: Estimated Rebates | $ (4,039,094.04)               |
| Lever 2: Predictive Formulary | $ (6,164,264.00)               |
| Lever 3: International Sourcing | $ (3,822,037.26)               |
| Ventegra Admin Fees        | $ 1,811,166.15                 |
| **Total New Cost**         | **$ 15,322,594.33**            |

## Slide 43: Longer term: multi-product platform connecting insurance carriers with cost-contained health risk

## Slide 48: The current treatment paradigm for SMI is expensive & ineffective
### The status quo for this patient population

*(Diagram showing patient journey)*

Patient goes to ER / Inpatient Psych Unit due to their SMI -> Costly multi-day ER Stay + Lengthy Hospitalization -> Hospital discharges patient with a poor care plan -> Ineffective short-term **outpatient** treatment by non-profit providers

*   **14M adults with SMI**
*   **$300B** annual spend
*   **$30K-1M** Prior annual cost for patients Amae has treated

*CONFIDENTIAL PROPERTY OF AMAE HEALTH, INC. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT WRITTEN APPROVAL.*

## Slide 49: We opened a clinic in LA to set a new standard for outpatient SMI care

*   Launched clinic in 4 months
*   Validated clinical model and outcomes
*   40% Contribution Margin within 12 months
*   $0 CAC
*   97% of Amae patients avoided re-hospitalization

## Slide 51: Amae's outcomes are 10x better than the standard of care

**Outcomes Table:**

|                        | Standard of Care |        | Amae Health |
| :--------------------- | :--------------- | :----- | :---------- |
| 30-day ER readmissions | 23%              | VS     | 3%          |
| Average LOS post readmission | 15 days          | VS     | 1.5 days    |
| Medication adherence   | 53%              | VS     | 90%         |
| Engagement             | 70% drop out after 1-2 visits | VS     | 7% drop out |

*These outcomes have led to value-based care contracts*

**Treatment Response in Amae Patients with Severe Mood Disorders**
*CAT-MH, 0-100 Scale*

## Slide 62: RightSite
### ER MD telehealth + SDOH navigation for EMS / 911 non-emergency patients

## Slide 63: + THE PROBLEM

*   **130 million** people visit the ER each year.
*   **Over 50% of these visits are not emergencies and are avoidable.**

**H**
*   **$3,400** is the average cost of an avoidable ER visit – 8x higher than urgent care or PCPs.

**EMS**
*   EMS is reimbursed only when transporting patients to an ER, whether or not they have an emergency. EMS also averages long response times for true emergencies because of staffing shortages and hours-long hospital unloading times for low-acuity patients.

**!**
*   Patients receiving non-emergency care from ERs experience long wait times, surprise bills, and unnecessary services.

## Slide 64: + THE RIGHTSITE OUTCOME
### Our tech-enabled service navigates non-emergency patients to in-network providers – generating better clinical outcomes and patient experience at a lower cost.

*   **Plan Members** have a better experience and improved outcomes at a lower out-of-pocket cost and avoid surprise ER and ambulance bills.
*   **Communities** have greater health equity through better access to appropriate care at the right time.
*   **Payors** have less leakage and better member experiences while saving an average of $3,000 per ER trip.
*   **EMS** provides better patient care, experience and outcomes while increasing runs per shift, availability for true emergencies, and revenue.
*   **Community Providers** treat more patients otherwise headed to an avoidable ER visit.
*   **Hospitals** reduce overcrowding and create more ER availability for true emergencies.

## Slide 65: RightSite Service and Outcomes
### RightSite diverts ~70% of non-emergent 911/EMS patients.

*(Diagram illustrating the RightSite service flow)*

**911 / EMS** -> **RightSite (Board-Certified ER Doc + RightSite Navigator)**

**Diversion (70%) to:**
*   31% Telehealth
*   37% Urgent Care
*   2% PCP

**Non-Diversion (30%) to:**
*   28% ER
*   2% Refusal

**Outcomes (Atlanta Results):**
*   **70% REACH RATE** FOR FOLLOW-UP
*   **PATIENT SATISFACTION 9.7/10**

**EMS or Dispatch initiates RightSite's service “pre-ambulance”**
*   ER MD telehealth
*   SDOH navigation
*   Follow-up services

## Slide 66: Call Volume and ER Diversion Rate
### RightSite's 911/EMS call volume continues to grow. In October, we added our first 911/EMS client sending calls directly out of dispatch (San Antonio Fire/EMS) vs. on-site (Grady/ATL) eliminating the cost of an ambulance trip altogether.

**RightSite Activations 2023**

## Slide 67: Call Volume and ER Diversion Rate
### This activation waterfall of results illustrates the contrast between Atlanta and San Antonio. Currently, Atlanta's volume comes entirely from the on-scene EMS, while San Antonio's volume originates entirely within the 911/EMS dispatch center. Both communities will eventually combine field and dispatch activations, but this "pure" view offers insight into the outcomes of these activation methods (field vs. dispatch).

*(Diagram showing activation waterfall for Atlanta and San Antonio)*

**On-Scene-Originated Activations (Atlanta)**
*   **738** RightSite Activations (Aug/Sep/Oct)
    *   **70% Treated via Alternate Care**
        *   31% Urgent Care
        *   37% RightSite Telehealth
        *   2% PCP/Specialist
    *   **28% Needed ER**
        *   17% RightSite MD
        *   7% Patient Choice
        *   4% UCC/Other
    *   **2% Refused Service**
        *   7% go to ER without cost of EMS ambulance/crew with RightSite navigation (This percentage seems to refer to a subset of the 28% Needed ER / 17% RightSite MD)

**Dispatch-Originated Activations (San Antonio)**
*   **269** RightSite Activations (Sep/Oct)
    *   **59% Treated via Alternate Care**
        *   15% Urgent Care
        *   42% RightSite Telehealth
        *   2% PCP/Specialist
    *   **33% Needed ER**
        *   26% RightSite MD
        *   6% Patient Choice
        *   1% UCC/Other
    *   **8% Refused Service**
        *   17% go to ER without cost of EMS ambulance/crew with RightSite navigation (This percentage seems to refer to a subset of the 33% Needed ER / 26% RightSite MD)
