## Cardiovascular disease is a solved problem

Table of Contents

## Executive summary

* Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of death in modern nations
* Lifetime exposure to circulating LDL is the root cause of cardiovascular disease
* Circulating LDL can be dramatically lowered with safe pharmacological treatments
* For young adults in good health, preventative usage of LDL-lowering therapies eliminates future risk of cardiovascular disease

## Abstract

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the developed world. The progression of cardiovascular disease is fully dependent upon the retention of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) into the arterial wall, triggering the growth of atherosclerotic plaques. Only certain LDLs, namely those attached to apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), tend to become pathologically embedded in the arterial wall in the course of their circulation in the bloodstream. Circulating levels of lipoproteins are largely genetically determined, with minimal influence from lifestyle factors, and modern pharmaceuticals are capable of dramatically reducing LDL levels to those incapable of causing cardiovascular disease in the span of a human lifespan. These pharmacological treatments are safe and well-tolerated, and there is no lower limit at which LDL reduction stops being beneficial. For young adults in relatively good health, aggressive LDL reduction will permanently protect them from developing cardiovascular disease with nearly zero downside. Consequently, cardiovascular disease is effectively a fully solved problem.

## Introduction

The claim that cardiovascular disease is solved is at first glance outlandish. In 2020, the CDC ranked heart disease as the most common cause of death in the United States, surpassing even the death toll from all cancers combined.[1](#ref-1) How is it possible to claim that CVD is “solved?”

In this article, I will advance the conclusion that cardiovascular disease is, indeed, solved. Half a century of scientific advances, beginning with the development of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (also known as statins) in the 1970s and culminating with modern biologics such as PCSK9-neutralizing antibodies have given us the ability to completely and safely ablate the entire causal pathway leading to the development of atherosclerotic disease. Therefore, we are in principle capable of fully eliminating cardiovascular disease from all future generations, as well as for anyone currently living today who is in reasonably good health and has not yet developed irreversible atherosclerotic lesions.

Careful biochemical, epidemiological, and molecular studies have established that cardiovascular disease directly results from the deposition of cholesterol molecules in the subendothelium; this deposition is directly caused by the presence of LDL molecules in the bloodstream; finally, we are capable of reducing circulating levels of LDL well below natural physiological levels. Furthermore, a plethora of theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that reducing circulating LDL levels is purely beneficial to human health. Therefore, the elimination of a cardiovascular disease is essentially a “free lunch” which should be taken advantage of at an individual, and ideally population-wide, level.

This chain of reasoning is not invented from thin air; rather, each step is supported with a tremendous volume of scientific data from the last several decades. The state of scientific consensus has continually evolved toward the direction of more, and earlier, lipid-lowering therapy. The only missing element is a synthesis which takes this reasoning toward its logical conclusion—truly preventative medicine which seeks to eliminate the root cause of cardiovascular disease before it is ever given the opportunity to grow.

Human biology and cardiovascular disease are complex topics, and while I have tried to simplify the discussion to the extent possible, some degree of irreducible complexity remains. The intention of this article is to present a logical, step-by-step argument leading to the conclusions outlined above. Occasionally, short digressions to clarify confusing but essential details have been inserted where appropriate. I ask the reader to kindly tolerate any confusion resulting from my personal deficiencies in writing ability.

## Circulating LDL causes cardiovascular disease

### Basic pathogenesis

We begin by reviewing the current scientific consensus on the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, the history of which has been extensively described in comprehensive reviews.[2](#ref-2) Lipoproteins are complex macromolecules which consist of

* an interior with cholesterol and triglycerides,
* a phospholipid outer shell, and
* an apoliproprotein attached to the outer shell.

Their primary function is to transport the interior contents, which are fatty and therefore insoluble in water, throughout the bloodstream, and they are generally categorized according to their size and to the identity of the attached apolipoprotein.

Lipoproteins, especially those smaller than 70 nm in diameter, are continually moving in and out of the arterial wall. Crucially, a small proportion of these lipoproteins, specifically apoB and Lp(a), tend to become trapped inside the subendothelium. This triggers a local, maladaptive, inflammatory response which increases the rate of further lipoprotein deposition, ultimately leading to the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque.

The accumulation of such plaques, known as atherosclerosis, stiffens the arterial wall and restricts the flow of blood, and is the primary cause of cardiovascular disease.

### Lipoprotein nomenclature

Before a more detailed discussion of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, it is important to momentarily stop to clarify relevant nomenclature. In order from largest to smallest by diameter, the most common cholesterol-containing lipoproteins are:[3](#ref-3)

* chylomicrons
* chylomicron remnants
* very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs)
* LDLs attached to apoB
* LDLs attached to apoB, which is itself attached to Lp(a)

In general, LDLs attached only to apoB are the primary contributor to atherosclerosis; LDLs attached to apoB-Lp(a) are a secondary contributor; finally, all other lipoproteins are relatively minor contributors, aside from perhaps somewhat smaller VLDLs which generally vary in a manner correlated with LDLs attached to apoB.

In this article, the term “LDL” will be used to refer generally to both types of LDLs described above (apoB-only and apoB-Lp(a) moieties). Therefore, taken in conjunction with the fact that these two subcategories of lipoproteins constitute the vast majority of all pathogenic lipoprotein deposits in arterial walls, the term “LDL” can be taken as nearly equivalent to “lipoproteins which cause cardiovascular disease.”

Note that LDL, in this context, is different from LDL-C, which refers to a specific way of estimating serum concentrations of LDL (both subtypes included) from laboratory measurements of high-density lipoprotein (chylomicron and chylomicron remnant) levels and triglyceride levels. Typically, LDL-C is given in units of mg/dL (mass per volume). This should itself be distinguished from “apoB levels” and “Lp(a) levels,” which are measurements of each of the two subtypes of LDL, and may be given in units of either mass per volume or molecule count per volume. The importance of the distinction between measurement by mass and measurement by molecule count will be made clearer at a later stage.

Although seemingly pedantic, the different and overlapping types of lipoproteins along with inconsistent and confusing use of terminology in the scientific literature make it difficult to understand the exact pathways underlying the LDL-based pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Clarification of this terminology will therefore clarify the discussion which follows.

### Genetic evidence demonstrates LDL causality

Many epidemiological studies have shown strong associations between LDL levels and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However, as wide-ranging as these studies may be, they are ultimately observational in nature, and therefore cannot definitively speak to the causal relationship between LDL levels and cardiovascular disease. Similarly, although the exact molecular mechanisms of LDL deposition in the arterial wall and arteriosclerotic plaque formation have been clarified through through studies *in vitro* and in animal models, these again do not definitively show that circulating LDL is a direct causal factor in the development of cardiovascular disease.

Although noncausal evidence is still quite valuable, we will not discuss epidemiological or mechanistic studies in too much detail—they are by nature highly detailed, often difficult to interpret, and easily challenged. Instead, we will briefly examine the two strongest forms of causal evidence relating LDL to cardiovascular disease.

The first type of truly causal evidence capitalizes upon the inherent randomness of genetic recombination in human reproduction. Statistical techniques such as Mendelian randomization and latent causal variable analysis have demonstrated that genetic variants associated with higher LDL levels are also associated with lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease.[4–6](#ref-4) The second type of causal evidence is data from randomized clinical trials testing LDL-lowering therapies, which have consistently shown for multiple decades that drugs which lower circulating LDL levels improve mortality from cardiovascular disease.[7](#ref-7) Famously, PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations that accelerate clearance of circulating LDL through the natural LDL receptor (LDL-R) pathway are also associated with up to 90% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, a finding which later motivated the development of the highly successful class of PCSK9 antibody drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

![](http://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-27-at-1.16.36-PM-1024x591.png)

It is valuable to note that both genetic studies and clinical trials encompass different and independent mechanisms through which LDL levels are varied. For example, the genetic loci identified in genetic studies as having dual relationships with circulating LDL levels and with cardiovascular disease risk are associated with over 50 different candidate genes, and the synthetic pathways of the drugs tested in LDL-lowering clinical trials (HMG-CoA and PCSK9) are broadly non-overlapping. The diversity of the LDL synthesis mechanisms involved in these studies further supports the hypothesis that LDL directly causes cardiovascular disease, rather than merely being an indirect correlate of the true causal mechanism. Otherwise, one would expect that only a specific subset of pathways leading to LDL synthesis would be identified by genomic randomization studies or successful pharmacological drug development.

Taken in conjunction with the tremendous volume of scientific literature elucidating the specific biochemical mechanisms through which circulating LDL becomes embedded into the arterial wall and provokes the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, these lines of causal evidence strongly suggest that higher levels of LDL directly lead to higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Cumulative LDL exposure determines cardiovascular risk

Going off the premise that circulating LDL levels is the primary causal factor driving atherosclerosis, a natural question to ask is: What is the exact mathematical model that describes the relationship between LDL levels over the course of an individual’s lifetime and their risk of cardiovascular events? Starting with the proposed mechanism where LDL molecules embed themselves over time into arterial walls and trigger subsequent plaque formation, we might put forth two intuitive proposals:

* Cardiovascular risk should increase in proportion with cumulative lifetime exposure to circulating LDL
* Holding cumulative lifetime exposure constant, higher exposure at younger ages is associated with higher risk compared to higher exposure at older ages, because there has been more “opportunity” for atherosclerotic plaques to form around LDL deposits

Although studies of cardiovascular risk in younger-age cohorts are few and far apart, a recent study found support for precisely the two hypotheses outlined above:[8](#ref-8)

![](http://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-27-at-1.27.44-PM-1024x630.png)

Additionally, subclinical atherosclerosis in middle or old age is commonly observed even at LDL levels considered ‘optimal’ (<70 mg/dL) by standard clinical guidance.[9,10](#ref-9) This observation is again consistent with our theoretical model where cardiovascular risk depends on cumulative lifetime exposure to circulating LDL rather than short-term or instantaneous LDL levels.

The concordance of empirical data with our theoretical model has three significant implications. First, it bolsters our confidence that our mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease is largely correct. Second, it implies that treating elevated LDL in older age is “too little, too late” as the damage from accumulated LDL exposure cannot be easily undone. Third, and perhaps most interestingly, it implies that maintaining extremely low LDL levels well below the ‘optimal’ threshold of 70 mg/dL throughout one’s lifetime has the potential to *completely prevent* the development of cardiovascular disease.

### ApoB particle count is the best metric of LDL levels

So far, we have talked about “LDL levels” in a generic fashion, referring broadly to the levels of deleterious LDL particles in circulation without specifying a particular assay or metric to use. At this juncture, however, it is valuable to take a brief detour to clarify this ambiguity.

Typically, LDL is quantified as a ratio of mass to volume, given in units of mg/dL. However, given our discussion above, it is not necessarily obvious that this is the *best* way to measure LDL levels in the context of cardiovascular risk. Given our proposed mechanism of CVD pathogenesis, where LDL particles stochastically embed themselves into the arterial wall, one might intuitively hypothesize that:

* larger LDL particles are less likely to flux into the arterial wall, but once they do so, they are more inflammatory, whereas
* smaller LDL particles are more likely to flux into the arterial wall, but once they do so, they are less inflammatory.

Under this model, the pathogenic effect of an LDL particle is not necessarily
