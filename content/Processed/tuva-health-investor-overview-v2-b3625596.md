## Slide 1: The Foundational Data Platform for Healthcare Intelligence

The Foundational Data Platform
for Healthcare Intelligence
TUVAHealth

## Slide 2: Opportunity - Data Transformation Unlocks the $50B+ Healthcare AI Market

### Data Access
Access to healthcare data has increased massively
A decade ago most healthcare organizations had access to a single data source (i.e. their own EHR or claims database). Now, thanks to interoperability and value-based care tailwinds, they commonly have access to dozens of data sources, including payer claims, EHRs, FHIR, ADT, and labs.

### Data Transformation
The critical unlock for healthcare AI
Healthcare data is messy, stored in inconsistent formats, with rampant data quality problems. Legacy tools hide transformations behind black-box processes, use inconsistent definitions, and can't run natively on modern data platforms (e.g. Snowflake, Databricks, dbt).

### Intelligence Generation
The best AI needs clean, high-quality data
AI can dramatically scale intelligence, making insights available to everyone regardless of whether they know SQL. Yet, safe and accurate AI requires high-quality data—making robust testing and quality assurance possible.

## Slide 3: Healthcare Organizations spend $5-10M annually on fragmented data transformation & analytics solutions

## Slide 4: Problem - The Problem With Legacy Healthcare Data Vendors

| | Legacy Vendors | Tuva |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost** | Legacy solutions are expensive ($5-10m/yr) while HCOs are under extreme pressure to cut costs. | Tuva is ~50% cheaper than legacy solutions (Tuva Core is free). |
| **Tech Stack** | Legacy solutions don't integrate with modern data tools (e.g. Snowflake, Databricks, dbt), increasing manual integration work for data teams. | Tuva is built on modern data tools that data teams love and HCOs are trending to adopt. |
| **Transparency** | Legacy solutions are black-box, meaning data teams can't see how transformation code works, making it impossible to validate reporting and customize. | Tuva runs inside customer's cloud, giving them full control and transparency into data transformations. |

## Slide 5: Solution - Tuva Core: The Freemium GTM Strategy

### Tuva Core (The Free Foundation)
*   Includes key foundational healthcare data platform components i.e. Connectors, Core Data Model, Data Marts, Data Quality Tests, and Terminology & Value Sets.

*   **Christian Minich** (Sales Engineer at Dagster Labs): "On this Independence Day, learn how you can free your healthcare analytics data from your vendors in this fun chat with Joe Reis and Aaron Neiderhiser. Open source healthcare analytics FTW! As someone who worked at an org that "built" an analytics capability from scratch, it's expensive in terms of time but so worth it. Worth it because the skillsets and capabilities in house buys you credibility, buy in, and useful analytics. But I worked at a world class research hospital system. I see Tuva as a way for smaller orgs to get that same capability for much less." (Tuesday, May 27th)
*   **Vishnu Rachakonda** (Claims Data Scientist): "EDIT: ENROLLMENT FOR CLAIMS 101 CLOSES NEXT MONDAY! Leveraging Cursor + AI to analyze claims data has been a huge unlock for me. I use deidentified claims data all the time. Analyzing all the random place of service codes, bill types, and even identifying and researching specific groups and practices can be a breeze using it. One of the most fun use cases I recently uncovered was setting up Tuva Health on a claims dataset using Cursor and Wispr Flow. I literally just talked to my computer and it setup the entire Tuva Project AND their new data quality index on a claims dataset end to end in a few hours. Pretty magical." (Wednesday, April 30th)

## Slide 13: Tuva AI will automate activities around Tuva data model

Training safe & accurate AI requires a normalized, enriched, and quality-tested data model, which Tuva Core provides.

### Manual Process (3-4 weeks)

*   **Data Engineer**
    *   Using Tuva requires writing custom code to map each raw data source into the Tuva Input Layer.
*   **Data Analyst**
    *   Defining clinical concepts for analysis requires specialized clinical informatics knowledge of code sets (ICD-10, RxNorm, etc.) and detailed knowledge of the Tuva data model.

### Tuva AI (15-30 minutes)

*   **Agentic Data Harmonization**
    *   Tuva AI automatically transforms any data source—claims, EHR, ADTs, FHRI, PDFs—into the Tuva Input Layer, normalizing schema and vocabulary so Tuva Core can run.
*   **Agentic Analytics**
    *   Tuva AI automatically generates code sets, analytics code, and statistical results (i.e. notebook-style tables, charts, and graphs) for data analysts to review and refine.
