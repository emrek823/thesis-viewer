## Slide 3: Healthcare is under pressure

# Healthcare is under
# pressure

* Operational and Medical
inefficiencies are eating into
margins and care quality
* Legacy solutions are slow &
expensive
* Ai is in the early
experimentation stage
* Difficult and expensive to build
home-grown Ai solutions

# SLM In Action: Case Study

**Client Partner:** Fortune 20 Healthcare company
**Objective:** Extract biomarker entities from a BILLION Oncology documents

**Process Flow:**
1.  MarkerGenie -> AI Agent -> Prompt
2.  AI Agent -> Dataset creation for below tasks: 1. Entity Extraction
3.  Dataset Creation -> Auto-labeling through in-house Annotation Studio
4.  Auto-labeling -> Subject Matter Expert (Human Feedback loop)
5.  Subject Matter Expert -> Pre-training
6.  Pre-training -> Penguin Pre-trained Model
7.  Prompt -> Fine-tuned our SLM on the organization datasets
8.  Fine-tuned SLM -> Org-specific documents (input for fine-tuning)
9.  Fine-tuned SLM -> Built Biomarker co-pilot on top of fine-tuned model
10. Built Biomarker co-pilot -> Integrated the Copilot in the existing workflow

**Results Delivered:**
