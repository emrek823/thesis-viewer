# Tuva Re-investment Memo

## Executive Summary

Tuva is building a healthcare specific, open-source data platform for providers, payers, and biopharma that ingests raw data (EHR, claims, labs, etc), transforms that data with business logic, and layers on analytics dashboards. Over the last 2.5 years, Tuva has validated its open-source approach, built a platform with multiple closed-source products on top of open-source, and expanded from digital health startups to large enterprise customers.

Tuva is currently at a $1.1M annual run-rate for its managed services offerings on top of their open-source data model, and at an inflection point for commercial growth, similar to open-source successes in other industries (e.g., dbt Labs, Hugging Face, etc). These successes and early customer and industry feedback give us confidence in Tuva's approach for community-first product adoption and then layering on enterprise contracts.

The enterprise platform is built and ready to scale with companies like Astrana ingesting 70+ data sources and others like MultiCare serving 380K+ patients. The engagement from the open-source community is driving additional use cases (e.g., medical economics for biopharma) and community meetups discussing healthcare data topics are driving enterprise contracts (e.g., Hinge Health). At the end of 2024, Tuva signed its first enterprise contract for $600K with MultiCare, a large health system with an ACO in the Pacific Northwest, to replace its established predecessor actuarial vendor, Milliman MedInsight.

Tuva is selling known solutions (data ingestion) and products (benchmarking) to customers with already defined problems and budgets in a $20B+ healthcare data market with strong tailwinds for growth. The company is not reinventing the wheel with novel product offerings, but instead innovating on distribution through a novel open-source approach to provide a more comprehensive suite of offerings at higher quality. Our relationship with the management team over the last 2 years has given us a privileged position to understand the leading indicators of growth for an open-source data business in healthcare, a model which has not been attempted before Tuva. We have been working closely with management over the last 3 months to define an operational plan to bring on 2 key sales hires and reach $3M in ARR over the next 12 months.

We are excited to invest $2-3M in a $4M Seed-II round at a $30M post-money cap to enable the company to reach $3M+ ARR, build out additional products (benchmarking analytics, MapAI) on the Tuva platform, and lay the foundation for the Tuva data network.

## Refresher on Company

Tuva was founded in 2021 by Aaron Neiderhiser and Coco Zuloaga largely because they spent too much time at previous healthcare companies (Health Catalyst, Strive) building “shiny dashboards” versus focusing on core data transformation capabilities. Tuva built an open-source platform to serve a burgeoning user persona of healthcare data analyst that has grown rapidly over the last 5 years and to provide a hybrid option for today's buy vs. build paradigm. Customers can buy solutions from current black-box vendors but have limited transparency into the methods used to transform data and no control over their data. Customers who choose to build internally struggle to hire and retain domain expertise to move quickly to match their business needs.

Tuva is tackling the healthcare data market, a $20B+ market that touches every constituent in the healthcare ecosystem (health systems, provider groups, small/large payers, biopharma, pharmacy, employers, etc). There are a number of players at $1B+ in EV (Inovalon, IMO, Datavant) and a long-tail of players doing $50M+ in annual revenue (PurpleLab, Trilliant, Quest Analytics) that are decades old and have raised minimal venture funding. The healthcare data market continues to grow at a ~22% CAGR and data transformation has grown in importance as companies require high-quality data to fuel downstream AI applications. In the near-term, layering the semantic knowledge that Tuva provides on top of your data improves the ability to answer questions with LLMs - in some cases 3x more accurate. In the mid/long-term, Tuva can allow data owners and originators (providers and patients) to monetize their data to give LLM providers with access to curated healthcare data that is not publically available.

## Key Risks at Time of Initial Investment + Progress over Last 2 Years

The biggest risks at the time of our original seed investment in Jul-22 were threefold:

*   Does open-source drive core product improvements and commercialization (e.g., unlock alternative to build vs. buy paradigm)?
*   Can Tuva build a comprehensive platform with multiple product offerings in a space where other companies build their entire business around 1 or 2 products?
*   Can Tuva sell to enterprise customers and go beyond digital heath startups?

Tuva has de-risked these 3 areas, which is driving our current conviction in doubling down. Admittedly, Tuva has taken longer than we originally thought on enterprise expansion. However, we've since grown to learn from our experience with the team, talking to customers, and looking at other open-source companies that this timeline is actually a feature, not a bug, of their open-source approach that was both necessary and will meaningfully pay off in the long-term.

## Open-source

The Tuva Project provides open-source documentation, a knowledge base for healthcare data concepts, and a slack community. Tuva provides a hybrid model that is the optimal middle-ground to current buy vs. build solutions. Customers get advanced analytics up and running in a week with full control and transparent code reviewed by the largest healthcare data analytics community in the world (1,500+). Open-source has led to improved product developments from open-source users recommending use cases (biopharma HEOR analyses, expediting benchmarking analytics, etc) and driven top of the funnel customer interest that has led to enterprise contract discussions. The Hinge Health opportunity ($300-$500k contract) came from potential Tuva users at Hinge who attended one of Tuva's community meetups.

Open-source successes in other industries (e.g., dbt Labs, Hugging Face, etc) show that Tuva's path (community-first product adoption, layering on enterprise contracts) is a well-defined strategy in open-source. When dbt raised its $13M Series A, it had 5,000 members in the dbt slack vs. 350 members 2 years earlier. Hugging Face was founded in 2016 but only began offering paid features in 2021. The company ended 2021 with $10M in revenue.

## Product

Tuva has invested 30,000+ hours in building a multi-product, enterprise platform on top of the open-source that is ready for scale for even the largest customers. Today, Astrana ($1.8B market cap) is using Tuva to ingest 70+ different data sources and MultiCare is leveraging Tuva for population health initiatives with 380K+ patients.

Tuva has taken a purposeful, multi-product approach that is informed by open-source that is a critical investment for future growth. Fundamentally, Tuva's commercial offerings are built around getting data in and out of the Tuva data model. Upstream, its built data ingestion, integration, harmonization, and data refresh tooling to move raw data into the open-source data model. Downstream, the company has built solutions that leverages data transformed in the data model to fuel analytics for HEDIS measures, benchmarking, and medical economics. Today, companies will work with individual companies for actuarial analytics (Milliman), data transformation (Innovaccer), benchmarking and population health analytics (Arcadia), EMPI (Verato), and more.

## Enterprise

The comprehensive platform offering today has drastically changed Tuva's positioning with all customers, particularly in the enterprise. In 2022 after our original investment, Series A healthcare startups like Firsthand leveraged Tuva open-source initially but transitioned away from Tuva as Firsthand's business scaled. Firsthand is now back at the table after hearing from the community and seeing product improvements in the public documentation. In addition, Tuva signed its first enterprise contract with MultiCare for $600K in Q4 2024 to manage 380k patients, and is in discussions in Q1 2025 with Hinge Health for a similar size contract. The Tuva platform is ready for enterprise scale.

### Case Study: MultiCare

**MultiCare is thrilled to adopt Tuva for its speed, customization, and transparency.**

*   **Members:** 380k
*   **Contract:** $600k

"Tuva is a key investment into MultiCare's ability to succeed in VBC."
— Anna Taylor, AVP Population Health and Value-based Care

**Why they are adopting Tuva:**
*   **Speed:** Takes months to ingest and transform data into analytics on current platforms
*   **Control:** Current platforms have limited ability to customize data model to meet their needs
*   **Transparency:** Struggled to validate reporting and data quality due to lack of transparency of black box data models

For MultiCare, Tuva is replacing Milliman Medinsight, a legacy healthcare analytics provider, to power MultiCare's population health initiatives (e.g., how does our performance compare to other VBC benchmarks on cost and quality?). Hinge Health wants to leverage Tuva for member engagement (e.g., once we've received an employer's claims data, which members do we engage?) and medical economics research (e.g., based on employer's claims data, did our intervention save money?). Tuva has 4 other enterprise customers in the late-stage pipeline (CareAbout, Clover, CareFirst, Community Care Physicians) for H1 2025.

## Traction

### Additional Case Studies

**Patina Health**
*   **Replacing Competitor with Tuva**
*   Patina is a leading venture-backed VBC provider of primary care services for 65+ year-old adults. They are transforming ~10 claims and clinical data sources using Tuva as their data platform for value-based care analytics.

**Firsthand**
*   **Replacing Ursa with Tuva**
*   Firsthand is a leading venture-backed provider for patients with severe mental illness. They are sunsetting Ursa in favor of using Tuva on Snowflake.

**Care About Health**
*   **Replacing Innovaccer with Tuva**
*   Care About is a leading MSO and VBC provider serving 1 million+ patients via 900 locations and 6,000 providers. They manage 20+ data sources across claims, EHR, and HIE data feeds and are using Tuva as their data platform.

**Astrana Health**
*   **Replacing Innovaccer and Arcadia with Tuva**
*   Astrana is a multi-state MSO and VBC provider serving 1 million+ patients. They are mapping ~70 data sources into Tuva across claims, EHR, and HIE data sources, utilizing Tuva for all healthcare analytics.

## Next 12 Months

With this $4M financing, Tuva will formalize its solution offerings and bring on 2 BD/Commercial hires, build new offerings that enhance the ingestion of data and analytics of data from the common data model, and lay the foundation for the growth of the Tuva Data Network that is even more relevant today with the rise of LLMs.

### Commercial / GTM

Tuva has historically sold managed services on top of the open-source data model and is now transitioning to 4 defined solution offerings (more here). These offerings are different packaging of same platform and products built over the last 3 years, but represent an increasing sophistication in how and what Tuva is selling.

*   **Tuva Platform.** For customers who are unable to manage a full data platform at-scale. Tuva deploys, operates, and optimizes the platform in the customer's cloud, ensuring scalability, reliability, and operational excellence.
*   **Tuva Cloud.** For customers that don't want to own and control their own data platform, they can rent a portion of the Tuva Platform hosted in Tuva's cloud. Customers upload their data sources to Tuva Cloud and Tuva's team uses the platform to transform the customer's data.
*   **Products.** For Tuva open-source adopters and Tuva Cloud or Platform customers that need to solve specific problems around the open-source. Products include data quality intelligence, enterprise master patient index, NCQA-certified HEDIS measures, and risk-adjusted benchmarking.
*   **Technical Consulting Services.** For customers that need help setting up the open-source and/or building analytics on top of Tuva.

In the next 3-6 months, Tuva will bring on 2 sales hires - 1 person to lead enterprise growth and another for open-source adoption and user community development. The enterprise hire will focus on provider and payers where Tuva already has product market fit (PMF) while opportunistically targeting biopharma. On open-source, this new hire will formalize and double down on an open-source bottoms-up growth strategy. This includes engaging the slack community, blogs/content, monthly meetups, and formal PR/marketing.

### Product Roadmap

Tuva will continue to build out offerings upstream that make the mapping of data into the Tuva data model easier and downstream that improve analytics on top of that data. MapAI, which structures and normalizes data, makes it easier for customers to ingest data into the common data model. DataMartAI makes it easier for customers to build their own data marts (e.g., writing SQL and building value sets). Tuva will also continue to invest in R&D to improve the back-end cloud infrastructure for products and the platform (ETL Orchestration Container, embedding DQI in Portal). As Tuva engages with the community and learns from open-source adopters, Tuva will continue prioritize new use cases (expanding data types, securing internal data assets) to support their needs. Many of the pieces of the platform built for medical economics are similar for biopharma, but the terminology changes slightly from population health analytics (provider/payer) to treatment adherence/analytics (pharma).

### Tuva Data Ecosystem

Tuva's ultimate vision is to build a data ecosystem where 1000s of customers are connected by data mappings in the Tuva common data model. This vision has been the goal since founding the company, but has become more important for Tuva and its customers with the rise of LLMs.

Datavant (founded in 2017) built a data network on de-identification/tokenization, which increases access to data but does nothing to actually transform the data and make it fit-for-use. Tuva wants to create a data ecosystem based on data transformation, which data owners and data consumers are more likely to gravitate to in a world where data volume continues to increase and high-quality data is required to fuel LLM applications. As LLM applications in healthcare continue to grow, healthcare enterprises, and their in-house data practitioners, will increasingly need transformed and cleaned data to fuel those applications. There's a reason that dbt is the #3 most used AI and data product on Databricks, right behind HuggingFace.

Today, payers and providers sell their data to data brokers, who then sell it again to other data aggregators, who then work with analytics players to serve insights to end customers (provider, payer, biopharma). There are multiple $1B+ businesses built on this archaic model, but data owners and originators are waking up and want to capture more value from their data. MultiCare, for example, wants to de-identify their oncology data and find a way to monetize that data with biopharma. MultiCare, a Virtue LP, has repeatedly expressed to us their desire to monetize existing data assets yet lack the data engineering and technical resources to do this. Tuva can support these efforts.

## Financials / Milestones

Tuva has runway into Q1 2026 and this $4M round is an aggressive investment to drive commercial growth prior to a $15-$20m Series A.

**Financials.** You can find our internal edit of Tuva's financial model here.

Tuva has $88K in monthly revenue ($1.1M annual revenue run-rate) for managed services with 3 existing customers today - MultiCare, Herself Health, and Aligned Marketplace - driving $55K/month in managed services revenue and additional $30k/month for data source implementations or analytics projects. Today gross margins on data transformation are 20-30% as Tuva partially subsidizes adoptions to get as many customers on the data model as possible. Over time these margins expand in two ways:

*   1) Tuva becomes more efficient at data transformation
*   2) Tuva productize data transformation services into technology products (e.g. MapAI)

Long-term, Tuva expects all services margins to be in the 55-65% range and for technology margins to be in the 80-90% range. Most customers to purchase both technology and services. Early on (e.g. 2025/26) we expect this mix to be services-heavy e.g. 60/40 but over time this will shift in the direction of technology i.e. 40/60 or better as more and more services work is productized into applications with LLMs.

### Series A milestones

We have worked with Aaron to define key milestones to raise a successful Series A within a 12-18 month timeframe — high-level metrics include:

*   $3M in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in 2025 (>3X growth)
*   >60-70% blended gross margins across all 4 solution offering
*   5+ enterprise customers to show repeatability in the GTM motion and recurring revenue model. Likely a majority provider/payer, but biopharma would be opportunistic upside.
*   75+ open-source adopters (organizations); >2X current open-source org base.
