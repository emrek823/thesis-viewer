## Slide 3

A Big Challenge in Oncology Care

Almost all cancer patients experience symptoms (side effects) during treatment
 Current care models cannot manage patients well at home
 53% of oncology ER visits are unnecessary and can be avoided*

* ASCO POST 2017

## Slide 4

Remote Symptom Monitoring Offers Hope

Sloan Kettering clinical trial (published 2016)
 Tracked symptoms once per week
 Clinical outcomes
5-year survival probability increased 10%
Quality of life improved 11%
ER visits and hospitalizations reduced 7% and 4%, respectively

## Slide 5

However

5

More patients 
reporting symptoms

More nurses
to triage

Even Sloan Kettering cannot afford to implement remote 
symptom monitoring in a second site!

NOT Scalable!

---

## Slide 6

How can we monitor these patients and keep them out of hospitals, using only the resources currently available? In other words, how to find a scalable solution?
