### Blueprint Tech Platform Demo

- Treatment plan automation tool - reduces 12-hour process to 15 minutes
- Standardizes quality of autism care services through AI-powered clinical documentation
- Data ingestion workflow:
	- VB Map assessment parser: converts unstructured PDF data to JSON with ontology mapping
	- Parent interview analysis: uses LangChain with NDBI protocol and vector database
	- Vineland developmental profile: processes semi-structured assessment data
	- Diagnostic report integration: pulls all relevant client insights
- Domain analysis generates comprehensive language skills assessment (10x better than average BCBA work)
- Treatment goal generation: creates 121+ approved goals using multi-layered LangChain logic
- Clinical team actively uses internal version despite lacking polish

### Infrastructure and Scaling Challenges

- Current workflow requires manual document upload (5 minutes vs 6+ hours of BCBA work)
- Missing critical infrastructure components:
	- Data engineers for automated piping
	- MLOps/systems engineers for scaling
	- Front/backend developers for production polish
- Integration gaps with existing tools (Codes, Silna, Heidi) need addressing
- Prior authorization still manual: log into Codes portal, input information, click send
- Moving to modular Salesforce infrastructure but automation incomplete

### Business Impact and Next Steps

- BCBA utilization metrics improved significantly since Blueprint implementation
- Projected savings: $1,800 per client per reauthorization cycle (9 hours of BCBA time at $200/hour)
- 20% gross margin uplift potential for average BCBA managing 10 clients ($20K annual savings vs $100K salary)
- Plan to expand across all six service lines beyond treatment planning
- Fundraising strategy: improve demo from “B minus to A minus” over next 1-2 weeks before approaching Andreessen Horowitz and other top-tier VCs
- Need to better demonstrate operational evidence of clinical AI margin uplift with specific BCBA validation data
