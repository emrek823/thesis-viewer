## Interview Transcript

**Q: What part of your workflow does Silna help with the most?**
A: It helped with insurance verifications and authorizations and freeing up my staff's time for in house administration.

**Q: How long have you been using Silna?**
A: We used them for 1 year.

**Client:** Hello. Thank you for talking to us today. We are doing some research on Silna. To start, could you tell us about your background?

**Expert:** Got you. I'm a physical therapist. I'm a private practice owner. I've been in practice for 25 years. I wear many hats, so I do everything, HR, admin, management, clinical care. I also used to be a receptionist outside of college when I was on my way to medical school first. I had experience with calling insurance companies even way back, when I was 18, 19.

We have, historically and currently, have called insurance companies or checked online portals. We were doing that and then Jeff, who is owner of Silna, actually found us. How did he find us? I think on LinkedIn or something. He approached us, and basically, suggested his services.

I, for the price, was like, "No problem. I will give you guys advice." In the process of that, I gave him tons of information because like I said, I have so much experience with doing all of those types of calls and working the back end of the office with my biller. Used their services as they were growing as a company. They developed their own portal, so we utilized their portal. As they grew, we had some little problems with them. Again, you're only as good as the information you get.

**Client:** Totally. By the way, just to ground me, when is this?

**Expert:** 2023, 2024. Just recently. Basically, it was contract renewal which, again, was more the fall for us. I think he was like, "Hey, we're charging clinics a lot more for our services, so we're going to have to up your rate. We would do it on a per request type of pay." I was like, "That's okay. Forget it," only because we had some slight issues with our account executive.

**Client:** Got it. You mentioned you churned. Would love to just understand the details around why. I know I'll have a ton of granular questions around your workflow, etc., but I think it's helpful just to understand what was not working and how long you gave them to really see it through.

**Expert:** I would say we were with them either eight months to just a year or something like that. Again, he wanted to up the rate at our contract renewal date. We're in Prompt EMR. The issue was that when they made their own portal, they were like, "Oh, you need to input the data in there." We were like, "Okay, but it's a little redundant because someone has to manually enter the data into Prompt EMR, then we have to add it as well into Silna's portal."

Historically, what had happened was we were inputting it into Prompt. We had given them access, so they would just go into Prompt and find it. We would start an email chain, potential new patients, PNPs May 28, 2025 was the subject line. If someone called as a potential new patient, my staff would write all the intake stuff on paper.

We would put it into Prompt, and then shoot them a super quick email with that subject line and literally write like, "KW," no need for small talk, nothing, and just hit send. When the benefits were checked, they would respond on that same email and they'd say, "Done." We would go back into Prompt and then look at all the stuff that they had been trained by us to do.

**Client:** You're saying it was not incredibly automated at the time?

**Expert:** That was okay. That system was actually better because again, we weren't doing duplicate work. When we started having to put the data into Silna, somebody has to put the data into Prompt, but then you had to manually type it in also into the Silna portal and then wait for them there. It's this principle. Everything is all in the one EMR. The more stuff is in the EMR, the better because you don't have to keep opening different tabs with different software portals. That is why it was annoying to do that.

They also changed their tune. This is the thing that I definitely was like, "You know what? I am not going to use your services." I literally just had to work as front desk reception because my business manager was out and we didn't have an admin person. You can check an insurance thingy in two minutes if you're freaking fast. I'm freaking fast. When I go in, I can grab all that stuff.

The thing that takes the time is calling for visit authorization, if that's needed, and visit limits on the policy. They used to say it would take two to four hours, which we were like, "Dude, people shop for PT, so we need the benefits that we can talk to the potential client." They were like, "Now, we need to change it because it's going to be up to 24 hours." We were like, "It's not going to work for us."

**Client:** Prompt EMR, it sounds like it's not necessarily a replacement for Silna.

**Expert:** They just added a component into their software called pVerify. When we upload the information of a potential new client, we go into an area of the person's case and I can get real-time benefits through that.

**Client:** How much does that actually simulate what Silna was providing you with?

**Expert:** It would be the same thing, if not faster. I'll be honest, I haven't yet used it. We've signed up. We just actually haven't activated to actually use it. Basically, it's that thing when someone calls, I take their information down. I punch it into Prompt, I add the details like I normally would, which means you have to add the type of insurance, the ID number, things like that. You just flip to another tab in the Prompt portal, and there's a button that will just check the benefits right there.

**Client:** Got it. You didn't even necessarily need to look for another solution in the market that may have been better because you were already using something that was starting to build into that lane as well.

**Expert:** No. I wasn't using that. That rolled out just recently. We're talking the last couple of weeks.

**Client:** Did you just go back to the original way you did it?

**Expert:** I reverted back, correct. This was free.

**Client:** How painful is that?

**Expert:** It's not that painful. It's not that hard.

**Client:** You, obviously, walked through how you came into contact with them, but was the initial thought process like, "Okay, this could give us some lift. It's obviously a tedious manual process that we prefer not to have to do if we can automate it," and that's why you went with them in the first place? Was there another reason why you were inclined to try to automate this type of process?

**Expert:** It would unload my front office admin. When you're on a call or even checking insurance portal, you're logging in, you're punching the patient's data information in. The phone rings, and someone walks in to check in, and someone's leaving, so you got to catch them to schedule. If you don't have to do all that busy work to get into the portal or to be on a phone call, your front desk doesn't get tied up as much.

**Client:** Would you consider looking at just one of the clear alternatives to Silna, or are you just unconvinced of the value of a platform like this right now?

**Expert:** I would not look for another one at the moment that's external to my EMR. Like I said, my EMR has now built an integrated software piece that will check it through the Prompt system.

**Client:** Right. Just to clarify, are they building, basically, Silna's whole offering or is it just a portion of it?

**Expert:** A portion.

**Client:** Got it. Actually, that would be helpful just to understand what they are building and then what they are not that Silna offers.

**Expert:** It's roughly the same thing. It's just not external. You always need the patient's full name, their date of birth, member ID number, and that's pretty much it, and the insurance name. Once you get that info, if you punch it into Prompt EMR, you can request the benefits through that.

**Client:** Got it. It seems like they have decent traction, at this point. Obviously, it's been some time since you churned. I'm curious, just with your industry expertise, so to speak, why do you think they may be finding success now? Why other clinics are favoring them to the degree of pretty large contracts? I think you probably have a great perspective on what they might be doing right, where the value might be for other clinics.

**Expert:** If you're not in an EMR system that has that function, you need to look at that somewhere else if you want to unload your front office. The whole point of that is, it technically unloads your front office more.

**Client:** Right. As EMRs like Prompt EMR builds certain pieces of the functionality of Silna and build, they'll, obviously, have to continue to build out their product offerings to differentiate from what these EMRs are now providing. In your opinion, what are the next obvious lanes that they can start to tackle that could continue to differentiate them, from a product standpoint, versus some of the EMRs that are building the eligibility checking and prior authorizations?

**Expert:** I am not sure if they can do much more. I'm literally looking in my EMR to remember what they have. Our merchant services credit card company is a healthcare one with a very decently low interest rate whenever you charge a credit card. That's fully integrated and super easy to use. The fax is integrated. That's very common with an EMR.

There's a home exercise platform that's integrated that allows you to also bill remote therapeutic monitoring. That's billable time, now, under Medicare guidelines. It's like being an attorney. Now, you can actually bill for that time and get a little extra income.

They have electronic submissions for workers' compensation and no-fault. Google, G Suite, is integrated, so if you did telehealth, it's super easy. They have AI chart compliance, so feedback on documentation, that's integrated. They have even Etactics. It's like an automation for manual processing of sending paper statements, if you are still sending paper. They have workers' compensation and FTE documentation. They even have a marketing company that's integrated.

pVerify is the patient insurance eligibility, and now, they have OnusOne, which is a payroll performance platform that I'm just rolling out June 1st. That is integrated with Prompt as well. Prompt actually bought OnusOne as a company. I found them through, I think, PredictionHealth, because I was doing some webinar. When I learned about OnusOne, they're like, "Yeah, we were just acquired by Prompt." I was like, "What?" It's great.

They're definitely growing. That's what I'm saying. There's so many functions that they've added that are really keeping you in the one platform. Everything is integrated. I used to work when Prompt didn't have that. Again, Silna was an outside platform, so you'd have to go to their website, their login portal. You'd have to be in Prompt and then you have to flip to the different tab to be in that. It was a lot, back in the day, which is not long ago.

**Client:** Maybe, shifting away from, specifically, what Silna was providing you with. Generally speaking, where do you think the biggest opportunities are, within your tech stack, to provide you with some lift?

**Expert:** The biggest bottleneck, like I said, I was wearing all hats. I have two other clinicians, but I was the only admin person, literally, so I was wearing all the hats The biggest bottleneck for business is getting the full insurance verification at one shot.

Again, you can go into an insurance portal if you have the logins, which my business has all the logins for Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, etc., blah, Availity. When you log in there, you can get the insurance verifications, I'm not kidding, with definitely less than two minutes. It's so fast. All you have to do is put data entry in.

The problem is getting the visit limitation policy as well as if any authorization is required. That's the bottleneck. If you don't have the full plan benefits, when you call the person back, you're talking with 80%-90% of the data. I can tell you, if you called for wanting to come in, I'm like, "Let me check your insurance. I'll call you right back."

I call them back and then I give them, "Oh, you have a deductible of this, your out-of-pocket is this. They'll pay 70%, you pay 30%." I don't know how many plan visits are in the policy. I can't really speak to that yet, but I just want to capture the person because the most important thing that the person's concerned about is what do they have to pay out of their pocket?

If I hooked you in as a patient, I go through my whole spiel. I get the information. I personally get a credit card to verify so that I know that person's legit in coming in, and I can charge them if they no-show. I tell them, "I'm going to send you a confirmation email, please come 15 minutes early." I go through the whole spiel. I do all my paperwork, because we're paper-light, not paperless, and then I still have to call the insurance, at some point, to get the visit limitations and the authorization required.

That is like, when can I pick up the phone to go like, "If you are a member, press one. If you are a provider," go through the whole automation. Sometimes, you get it really fast. You get to a representative surprisingly fast. Other times, 30-40 minutes, you're like, "I'm still on the phone," but I've already been doing other stuff to consume my time versus just sitting there waiting for someone live to get on.

It's the wild thing, because you think that they would just have that listed in the portals. We've done workarounds with Blue Cross Blue Shield. If you just go under Carelon and punch them in like you're looking to do an authorization, it'll pull up the patients that truly are Blue Cross that are listed in there. You can see whether they require authorization or not for rehabilitation. That's my super quick workaround, but I still need to call because I don't know how many visits they have per calendar year.

**Client:** Even just outside of the EMR, as you adopt new tools, as we enter this new AI world, is there anything that's been consistently coming up in conversations with other providers? Anything that you know that other people are starting to use that's gaining momentum?

**Expert:** Now, it's AI documentation. I get hit with so many solicitor emails regarding just new billing companies, or with verifications, and authorizations, and that tracking. That's a slightly different beast. AI is the new one for documentation. That's the next thing. Within the next week, I will be sitting down, doing a webinar, and then probably pulling the trigger on signing up to offload my staff.

I took a vet visit with my cat and the vet was using AI. She just had her phone and she said, "Sorry, I'm just going to put this down here." You could see it's recording. She's like, "This is for documentation." I do not know if she said the word AI or whatever. I was like, "Oh, I know exactly what that is."

**Client:** You're saying more like note takers?

**Expert:** No. It's AI. It's just going to record and actually pull things that you say between you and the patient. It should be able to be smart enough to list what the key points are, that are required to be in the note. It crafts it, and then you still have to read it to make sure it actually accurately reflects what it did. All you have to do is have it running.

**Client:** Does that directly integrate into the EMR, or it's usually copy and paste?

**Expert:** I believe it's going to integrate because I'm going to do it through Sidekick. I found them through PredictionHealth. Like I said, PredictionHealth and OnusOne is fully integrated with Prompt and it's been a game changer. PredictionHealth is AI, so it's going to look at whether your documentation is compliant.

It was a game changer because when I sit with my therapist, it's my personal opinion, almost, saying it, but I was like, "Your assessment sucks. Where are all of your objective measurements?" Tender to palpation is a lame-ass objective documentation. Manual muscle testing of three-/5 for the hamstring means I can't bend my knee fully against gravity, that's objective because it's numerical, more so. When you describe stiff left side bending, it's more just observational. It's the lazy person's objective measurements.

PredictionHealth is really good with looking at it, and it tells you where your strengths are and tells you where your faults are. It graphs it, also, in green, yellow, and red so that whenever you talk to your staff, you're just like, "You're in the yellow. You need to be in green. Everyone needs to be green." If they're in the red, you're like, "What the hell is going on with your notes? They suck."

**Client:** You use a separate EMR, correct?

**Expert:** PredictionHealth is integrated with Prompt.

**Client:** Got it. What do you know? Is it generally a therapist EMR? Is that primarily who they serve?

**Expert:** Prediction? I think it's only for physical therapists, correct.

**Client:** Got it. Any other of those types of tools that you've heard of, in terms of, basically, doing what Sidekick is doing, but for other users?

**Expert:** No. I've only gotten solicited by other companies, but I delete the email so fast because I'm going to, probably, just use Sidekick because it's already integrated with Prediction and Prompt.

**Client:** Okay. Thank you very much. This was really helpful.
