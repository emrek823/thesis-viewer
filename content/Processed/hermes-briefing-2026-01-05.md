## Discussion Points
1. **Fundraising pipeline status**: Which of the 12+ investors in pipeline need immediate follow-up post-holidays? What's the status on Haystack, Seusso, and other Virtue introductions?
2. **JPM conference strategy**: How should we coordinate the Monday-Thursday agenda for maximum investor meetings and what's the follow-up plan for term sheet momentum?
3. **Revenue scaling**: With CZ Law bringing 500 monthly requests, what operational scaling is needed and how does this impact the $35K January target?
4. **Customer concentration risk**: CZ Law appears to be driving significant revenue - what's the plan for customer diversification and pipeline development?
5. **Competitive positioning**: How is the new positioning against CLO/Chartswell resonating with investors, and should we adjust messaging based on early feedback?
6. **Post-term sheet strategy**: How do we leverage the Torch term sheet to accelerate decisions from investors who were "waiting until after break"?
