## Discussion Points
1. **Fundraising pipeline status**: Which of the 12+ investors in pipeline need immediate follow-up post-holidays? What's the status on Haystack, Seusso, and other Virtue introductions?
2. **JPM conference strategy**: How should we coordinate the Monday-Thursday agenda for maximum investor meetings and what's the follow-up plan for term sheet momentum?
3. **Revenue scaling**: With CZ Law bringing 500 monthly requests, what operational scaling is needed and how does this impact the $35K January target?
4. **Customer concentration risk**: CZ Law appears to be driving significant revenue - what's the plan for customer diversification and pipeline development?
5. **Competitive positioning**: How is the new positioning against CLO/Chartswell resonating with investors, and should we adjust messaging based on early feedback?
6. **Post-term sheet strategy**: How do we leverage the Torch term sheet to accelerate decisions from investors who were "waiting until after break"?

## Market Development: Big AI Enters Healthcare (Jan 2026)

**What happened:** OpenAI (Jan 7) and Anthropic (Jan 11) both launched healthcare offerings within days of each other.

| Company | Consumer Product | Enterprise Product |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| OpenAI | ChatGPT Health - users connect own medical records + Apple Health for personal health assistant | OpenAI for Healthcare - HIPAA-ready, GPT-5 powered, prior auth/appeals automation |
| Anthropic | Claude health records beta (Pro/Max) - integrate personal + medical + insurance records | HIPAA-ready infrastructure, federal database connections |

**Key stat:** 230M weekly health queries on ChatGPT alone.

**Implications for Hermes:**

| Factor | Impact | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Market validation | ✅ Tailwind | Big AI investing heavily validates "AI needs identified data" - core "why now" point |
| Use case overlap | ✅ None | OpenAI/Anthropic = consumer asking about their OWN records. Hermes = B2B requesting records about PATIENTS for non-treatment use |
| Infrastructure pressure | ⚠️ Watch | More players building health data pipelines could accelerate EHR/payer defensive moves |
| Interoperability push | ✅ Tailwind | Consumer integrations may drive standardization that benefits B2B retrieval |

**Suggested fundraising framing:**
> "Anthropic and OpenAI are building the consumer front door - helping patients understand their own data. Hermes is building the neutral rails for identified patient data in use cases those platforms explicitly don't serve: litigation, underwriting, insurance appeals, clinical trials. The more AI needs health data, the more valuable data infrastructure becomes."

**Risk to monitor:** Enterprise prior auth/appeals automation is closer to Hermes territory. If big AI starts bundling record retrieval into enterprise healthcare stack, that's more direct competition.
