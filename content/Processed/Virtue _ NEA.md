### Translucent Series A Partnership Opportunity

- Blake talking with Jack in 2 hours, Michael spending significant time with him recently
- Traction looks great - about to hit 1M ARR milestone
- NEA and Virtue should co-lead Series A to help Jack focus on product/GTM without investor distractions
	- Both firms have strong conviction
	- New head of engineering hire looks very strong
	- Blake has reserved Series A capital at end of current fund

### Company Progress & Market Traction

- Health system momentum far stronger and faster than anticipated (18-24 months ahead)
	- Progression from intro calls to contracting conversations in 3-4 weeks
	- Multiple occasions in last 90 days including UT Southwestern, Cedars-Sinai
	- Cedars doing customer references this week, internal notes described exact need for Translucent solution
- Should prioritize hospital/health system opportunity over medical groups
	- Will require different org chart and resources
	- Early ROI metrics on initial contracts are positive
- Hiring pipeline consistently bringing top-tier talent (top 3-5 across portfolio)

### Current Fundraising Environment

- Heavy GP-level inbound interest from firms like GV
	- Jack showing Blake his inbox full of venture firm outreach
	- Jack remains humble and objective despite attention
	- Not getting distracted, wants best decision for company
- Blake predicts term sheet within 30-60 days based on market conditions
	- If current conditions hold, expects preemptive Series A by mid-late October

### Investment Strategy & Positioning

- NEA cannot compete with GV’s potential $100M+ valuation
- Willing to provide reasonable step-up valuation for co-lead opportunity
- All existing investors (including Pega from FPV) want to re-up
- Flexible on deployment amount and ownership percentage
- Jack doesn’t want to run process - interested in clean, expedient solution
- Focus conversation on evolving opportunity size rather than fundraise directly

### Next Steps

- Blake meeting with Jack later today
- Michael and Blake meeting Jack in NYC office next week (pre-scheduled)
- Will develop proposal after hearing Jack’s perspective
- Blake to connect with Pega at upcoming Interior board meeting
- Bonus intro: Sadika at Prudentia Sciences (GV-backed, serving biopharma M&A teams)
