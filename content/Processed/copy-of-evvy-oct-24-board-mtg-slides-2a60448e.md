Reminder on Series A Goals

1) Proving the scalability, effectiveness, and profitability of vaginitis business
Scalable:
* 25% QoQ growth in revenue
* Establishing medical & scientific credibility for the test & care platform
  * 5 peer reviewed publications / academic conferences
  * Provider partnerships with 3 early adopters to gather data on how we help doctors
Effective:
* Demonstrating Evvy improves patient outcomes compared to standard of care at scale (symptoms, microbial, recurrence)
Profitable:
* 3x LTV (12 mo gross margin) / CAC

2) Proving vaginal microbiome is relevant beyond vaginitis
* Revenue generating on IVF offering (playbook for pregnancy and beyond)

3) Proving the data can be monetized
* Revenue generating on first biomarker licensing deal (playbook for other diagnostics or CPG/pharma opps)

## Slide 6: PROGRESS ON SERIES A MILESTONES
PROGRESS ON SERIES A MILESTONES

| Objective | Key Result | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scalability of Vaginitis Business** | 25% QoQ revenue growth | At risk | Q2 QoQ growth was 21.2% and Q3 QoQ growth was 8.6% QoQ due to Head of Growth departure, product delays, and election headwinds. The marketing team has re-hired growth team and opened new channels less affected by election for Q4 (influencer, TikTok, Reddit). All teams @ Evvy are also focused on revenue in Q4 (launching in Canada, new Rx products, etc.). We will discuss growth in depth in our board mtg. |
| | 5 peer reviewed pubs / academic conferences | On track | Our test validation was published in peer-reviewed Diagnostics journal; we presented novel Evvy data at the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) and Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology (IDSOG); we kicked off academic collaborations with UW and UoFL. |
| | Provider partnerships with 3 early adopters | On track | There are now 830+ providers in the Evvy ecosystem and we've narrowed our focus to 2 high value initial provider types. We have signed on a PT person to experiment with growing sales through this channel in Q4. |
| | Stability of vendors / partners | On track | Completed first multi-SKU order fulfillment with 3PL. Seeing reliable TAT from our lab and pharmacy. Just hired our first Supply Chain Manager who will be working on cost optimizations in Q4. |
| **Effectiveness of Vaginitis Business** | Improved patient outcomes & NPS at scale | On track | We're so excited that Dr. Kate McLean has joined us FT as Chief Medical Officer to drive outcomes and innovative clinical expansion. 75% of patients report that they feel better and our current CSAT score is 87%. |
| **Profitability of Vaginitis Business** | 3x LTV/CAC | Attn | LTV continues to go up, but paid growth challenges (election) drove up CAC in parallel. We are starting to see overall lift to overall Care eligibility and conversion from initial care revamp launches and brought on a lifecycle marketer to drive LTV initiatives. ExPan continues to improve the margin profile of the test business. |
| **VMB is relevant beyond vaginitis** | Revenue generating product for IVF space | Attn | We signed our contract with Spring Fertility to partner on our landmark VMB / IVF study (!) and patient enrollment should begin this month. We are also hosting a booth at ASRM with the goal of establishing Evvy as the leader in VMB/IVF, meeting providers / partners who could be early adopters, and getting feedback. |
| **Our data can be monetized** | First biomarker licensing agreement signed | Attn | LabCorp has completed Evvy historical data validation & confirmed interest in co-developing a NuSwab reflex panel leveraging Evvy biomarkers (we are currently working through partnership agreement). Additional interest in Evvy biomarkers from CPG companies. Recently hired a ML scientist focused on biomarkers. |

Burn increased in Q3 due to an overdue hiring spurt; gross profit has grown substantially since Q4 2023 and is expected to continue growing without additional growth in headcount.

Note: DTC business burn multiple does not include the Research team salaries, R&D expenditure, research conferences, and a portion of our legal expenses.

## Slide 23: Evvy's platform is in a unique position to provide value to many players throughout the ecosystem
Evvy's platform is in a unique position to provide value to many players throughout the ecosystem

*   **Credible DTC distribution** — Pharma (Organon) & Biotech (Kapha Bio, Dare Biosciences)
    *   Distributing new therapeutics or getting new ingredients/technologies to market through our audience
    *   Seen as "credible" partner in vaginal health for their solutions to reach the market
*   **Discovery of novel markers** — CPG (HoneyPot) & Testing (LabCorp) & eventually pharma
    *   New targets for CPG products or diagnostics or therapeutics that they manufacture novel solutions and distribute to their (larger) audience

**Key questions:**
*   Where do we want to partner vs own the solution to the end?
*   Which opportunities enable us to create the most long term enterprise value?
*   What else should we be thinking about?

## Slide 24: Current plan
Current plan

*   **Bottoms up:** In the spirit of testing things this quarter, our plan is to:
    *   Continue forward with the Kapha partnership to test CPG (how hard is it for us to get our own true CPG products to market)
    *   Continue forward with HoneyPot to enable product development with our data
*   **Top down:** we are doing a workshop towards the end of this month to build a stronger perspective on how we want to engage with these opportunities moving forward
    *   What are the business models / what are examples of other companies in those spaces? Which ones are most successful?
    *   When will we make money, how much money can be made, risks (brand, credibility), time / resources to revenue
    *   Could we roll together other companies to hit certain value props / end goals
*   Would love any insight / support as we build out our perspective and priorities in these different areas!

## Slide 28: Evvy has demonstrated strong, reliable growth since launch.
Evvy has demonstrated strong, reliable growth since launch.

The stacked bar chart shows Evvy's revenue growth by quarter from Q2 2021 to Q3 2024.

| Quarter | Care Revenue | Test Revenue - Returning Customers | Test Revenue - New Customers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q2 2021 | (Small amount) | (Small amount) | (Small amount) |
| Q3 2021 | (Small amount) | (Small amount) | (Small amount) |
| Q4 2021 | (Small amount) | (Small amount) | (Small amount) |
| Q1 2022 | (Small amount) | (Small amount) | (Small amount) |
| Q2 2022 | (Small amount) | (Small amount) | (Small amount) |
| Q3 2022 | (Small amount) | (Small amount) | (Small amount) |
| Q4 2022 | (Small amount) | (Small amount) | (Small amount) |
| Q1 2023 | (Medium amount) | (Medium amount) | (Medium amount) |

| Q2 2024 | (Even larger amount) | (Even larger amount) | (Even larger amount) |
| Q3 2024 | (Largest amount) | (Largest amount) | (Largest amount) |

The bars show an increasing trend in total revenue over time. Within each bar, "Test Revenue - New Customers" is the bottom segment, "Test Revenue - Returning Customers" is the middle segment, and "Care Revenue" is the top segment. The proportion of "Care Revenue" and "Test Revenue - Returning Customers" appears to grow over time relative to "Test Revenue - New Customers."

## Slide 29: In Q3, we experienced our first growth headwinds.
In Q3, we experienced our first growth headwinds.

**TEST (New Customer Rev / Retention)**

*   **Team:** Went down to 1 person (lost Head of Growth, which also derailed hiring for Lifecycle Marketer)
*   **Meta / Google:** We intentionally doubled down on Meta/Google post-Series A, but they are the channels most impacted by HoG departure / election macro environment
*   **Gating all products behind test:** As discussed in previous board convos, gating all products means less tools to close revenue gaps.

**CARE**

*   **Team:** Delayed Lifecycle + Product Design hire
*   **Product Delays:** Designing the ideal a la carte Care & transparent care experiences took longer than expected (and required more hands on support from PLP).

**Missed 2024 revenue through September = $405K**

| | YTD Actual | YTD Forecast | % Miss |
|---|---|---|---|
| Test | $4,244,623 | $4,608,496 | (7.9%) |
| Care | $817,111 | $874,546 | (6.6%) |
| Equal Research Day Book | $16,392 | - | |
| **Total** | **$5,078,126** | **$5,483,043** | **(7.4%)** |

## Slide 30: In Q3, we also laid the groundwork to fix these issues.
In Q3, we also laid the groundwork to fix these issues.

| TEST (New Customer Rev / Retention) | What we're doing |
|---|---|
| Team: Went down to 1 person (lost Head of Growth, which also derailed hiring for Lifecycle Marketer) | Hired head of growth, patched lifecycle |
| Meta / Google: We intentionally doubled down on Meta/Google post-Series A, but they are the channels most impacted by HoG departure / election macro environment | Head of Growth hired (but on mat leave), new channels opening (influencer, Reddit, TikTok), SEO + Social SEO, expanding to fertility audience |
| Gating all products behind test: As discussed in previous board convos, gating all products means less tools to close revenue gaps. | Launching ungated Rx (more on that soon!) |

| CARE | What we're doing |
|---|---|
| Team: Delayed Lifecycle + Product Design hire | Patched Lifecycle, PD still in progress |
| Product Delays: Designing the ideal a la carte Care & transparent care experiences took longer than expected (and required more hands on support from PLP). | PLP much more involved + more aggressive timelines + no more extensive A/B testing |

## Slide 31: As you know, we are now targeting 130% YoY growth, aiming to end the year at $12.36M ARR in Dec ($7.975M in 2024 revenue).

## Slide 32: The entire team @ Evvy is taking big swings to experiment with potential growth unlocks
The entire team @ Evvy is taking big swings to experiment with potential growth unlocks

*   **Big swings:**
    *   Launching transparent a la care
    *   Launching Evvy Vaginal Health Test in Canada
    *   Launching Ungated Rx (offering symptom relief treatments on marketing site e.g. hyaluronic acid suppositories, soothing creams, boric acid)
    *   Actively investing in growth through providers (bringing on Brian part time)
*   **Smaller swings:**
    *   Organic PR: Kate joining, Spring IVF study, test validation paper, etc.
    *   Incentives: Selling coaching calls, using affiliate links for product referrals, enabling & incentivizing our coaches to upsell / cross-sell
    *   New audiences: Starting to market to fertility audience (with small product lift)

## Slide 33: Transparent a la care
Transparent a la care

**What?**
*   Showcase which treatments are likely included in a patient's program before purchase
*   Enabling all parts of the program to be purchased a la carte

**Why?**
*   Clear patient frustration with not knowing what is in a program pre-purchase or being able to buy pieces of the program without buying the whole thing
*   We've already seen an increase in program purchases by offering symptom relief products a la carte — hypothesis being that people want to know the types of products they will get before spending $250

**Timeline / outcomes:**
*   Launching mid/late October
*   Goal of increasing conversion into care programs to hit forecast goals

*"It did not tell me what my plan would be without paying first. I wish I knew my options."*
*"I wanted to pick and choose which treatment I wanted."*

## Slide 34: Ungated Rx
Ungated Rx

**What?**
*   Sell symptom relief Rx on our marketing site, ungated by test purchase/results

**Why?**
*   Reach wider audience:
    *   Serve people who want fast symptom relief
    *   Lower initial price point
    *   More familiar value prop that can lead into VMB testing
*   Support our existing audience:
    *   ~80% of our users are symptomatic at the time of taking their test (we can relieve their symptoms while waiting for results)
    *   2nd highest reason users don't convert into care is because they're already getting treatment elsewhere (we can serve them earlier)

**Timeline / outcomes**
*   Launch MVP in mid-November
*   >$200K (4k units sold) in Nov / Dec

**Product Example:**
**RELIEF**
**Pure Boric Acid**
14 suppositories
Our Pure Boric Acid Suppositories are designed to deliver powerful, prescription-grade relief from vaginal symptoms like odor and pH imbalance. More +

## Slide 35: Provider growth
Provider growth

**What?**
*   Expand outbound engagement of providers to grow the top of the funnel (with support from Brian Moreau)
*   Test different strategies to convert tests through our providers (840 providers in community, 87 on portal)

**Why?**
*   Organic interest continues to come inbound
*   Spent Q3 launching improvements to the portal and now excited about MVP to take to market
*   Competitors continue to push in this direction (e.g., TinyHealth, Juno)
*   Learn what works / doesn't with scale & should be prioritized in '25

**Timeline / Outcomes**
*   Kicked off Brian this week
*   Goal of selling 500 tests through providers by EOY

**Product Screenshot:**

**Questions/Feedback snippets:**
*   Does this work in Canada? Is it country based?
    *   1mo Workflow
*   Do you ship to canada? If not, do you have plans to expand to do this in the future?
    *   1mo
*   Hi there, I'm from Canada and desperately need an evvy test. Is there any way to get one shipped here? Sent from my iPhone
    *   3mo
*   my name is Dr. Kirsten and i'm a Naturopathic Doctor in Ontario, Canada. I have been following Evvy for quite some time now and am always very impressed by your educational content and the products you have built. As a practitioner and someone who has been dealing with ongoing unidentified vaginal symptoms for a decade now, I wanted to inquire about if there is any way your product is available to Canadians? Or if this is being considered? I would love to be able to use your tests myself as well as recommend them to my patients.

**What?**
*   Roll out the Vaginal Health Test in Canada in Q4 (will not include ExPan, diagnostic information, or care services to start)

**Why?**
*   **Market size:** Anecdotally, MicrogenDX noted Canada is their 2nd largest market for their own tests (**16.5M women** 20+ years old in Canada)
*   **Ease:** Proximity to U.S. makes logistics easier to set up by EOY
*   **Existing audience:** ~1.2K Canadian people on our marketing list, and most commonly requested geography in CX inbox

**Timeline**
*   Launch MVP in Nov
*   Goal of selling 800 tests into Canada by EOY

## Slide 37: [No slide title]
With the combo of all of these initiatives, revamping marketing foundation across growth & lifecycle, and the election season behind us, we are confident that our growth trajectory will be stronger than ever in 2025.

## Slide 39: Looking ahead to DTC in 2025
Looking ahead to DTC in 2025

We currently have a platform optimized for high intent / early adopters. In 2025, we'll be focused on new capabilities including:

*   New types of tests (urine, partner, hormones, etc.)
*   New treatments (on marketing site for immediate relief + expanded formulary)
*   Clear pathways / journeys / membership models for diff user types (fertility, pregnant, menopause, etc.)

We know that expanding our platform and leveraging our data to unlock new value props for new audiences will allow us to get our foot in the door with early majority.
