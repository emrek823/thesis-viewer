### 2025 Year in Review - Major Breakthroughs

- AI digital site twins innovation
	- First company to create digital twins for clinical trial sites (vs. existing patient digital twins)
	- Solves patchwork problem: vendors only access sites using their software, but clients need access to thousands of other sites globally
	- Top-down approach allows targeting any site on planet whether using Ryght software or not
	- 10x engineering effort required, took longer than expected but created unique capability
- AI harmonization engine built
	- Pulls data from multiple public/private sources efficiently
	- Passes unstructured data into digital twins
	- Agents constantly update twins with latest data dynamically
- Platform now covers 60,000+ digital twins, 145,000 investigators, 20 therapeutic areas, 450,000 trials, 192 countries

### Product Roadmap and Current Capabilities

- Network Navigator: Protocol-to-site matching
	- AI agents break apart 200-300 page protocols into relevant components
	- Precise matching against digital twin criteria (capabilities, expertise, facilities, qualifications)
	- Users can interrogate sites, compare options, narrow to best list for outreach
- Feasibility Accelerator: Outreach optimization
	- Finds best contacts at selected sites
	- Pre-populates questionnaire answers for sites to save time
	- Multi-modal campaigns planned (voice, SMS integration)
- Enterprise Agent Factory: Custom automation solutions for partnership clients

### Key Challenges and Market Dynamics

- $1.5M proposals moving to $100K pilots
	- IQVIA and AstraZeneca deals reduced from $1.5M each to $100K pilots
	- AI market noise causing buyer confusion and longer decision cycles
	- 95% of AI pilots failing to deliver value per MIT study
- Biotech funding freeze impacting CRO demand
- Sales cycles remain slow in conservative industry
- “Not invented here” syndrome - clients think they can replicate with ChatGPT

### Strategic Partnerships and Validation

- Accenture Ventures partnership
	- $500K seed investment completed
	- Global partnership agreement for Spotlight program
	- Brought into Merck, Regeneron, Amgen, BMS meetings
	- Partnership and investment announcement scheduled first week December
- Microsoft Azure Marketplace integration
	- Life sciences reps can earn commissions on Ryght sales
	- 50-75% of revenue counts toward rep quota relief
	- Easier procurement process for enterprise Microsoft customers

### Customer Base and Revenue Metrics

- True North customers (aligned with core mission):
	- QPS: Global CRO, 1,100 employees, 17 countries, 750 sites - using feasibility application in production
	- Exact Sciences: Site identification and activation
	- Biorasi: 125-employee CRO using for business development and pre-screening
	- Idea Biosciences: $150K ARR, 35-site study in 4 countries
- Revenue metrics: ~$1M bookings for 2025, ~$400K ARR secured
- Pricing model: $25K ARR for CROs, $50-100K ARR for biotechs, $2-3K per site for studies

### Pre-screening and Lead Generation Innovation

- Blinded questionnaire approach
	- Send synopsis without sponsor knowledge to gauge site interest
	- Can deploy before legal contracts in place
- IQVIA partnership for interview process
	- Voice agents conduct PI qualification calls
	- AI speaks 18 languages for global reach
- AstraZeneca pilot for understaffed global operations
- New marketing message: “Send us protocol synopsis, get list of interested PIs” - click-through rates increased from 1.6% to 3.1%

### Scientific Advisory Board and Site Partnerships

- Chadi Nabhan assembled inaugural scientific advisory board
	- Top global oncology leaders across multiple institutions
	- Focus on sponsor/CRO introductions and product strategy refinement
- 12 academic and community sites in US and Australia as co-development partners
- ASCO collaboration in development
	- Largest global oncology society (40,000 members)
	- Partnership to help with struggling clinical trial site identification
	- Could lead to joint publication opportunity

### Growth Buyout Strategy Discussion

- Rationale: Transform $100B clinical research labor market through AI-infused CRO acquisitions
	- Software companies struggle with slow enterprise sales cycles
	- Biopharma wants end-to-end service solutions
	- Regional CROs available at low multiples due to biotech funding challenges
- Target approach: Acquire regional CROs at 2-3x revenue, infuse with AI, achieve 6-8x revenue multiples
- Biorasi discussions ongoing
	- $16M trailing revenue CRO owned by PE firm
	- Interested in stock-only deal structure
	- Would pay off debt and provide cash to profitability
- Risk considerations: First deal critical to prove model before scaling to 7+ acquisitions
