### Background & Company Overview

- Sathvik Nallamalli, Stanford CS graduate focused on language models/NLP for 3 years
- 4-month stint at Athelas working on AI scribing and medical code billing automation
- Transition of care focus initially
	- Care handoffs occur at every stage of patient journey
	- Different providers rotating, inpatient to hospice shifts
	- Referral automation became entry point - outpatient, quickest market entry

### Product & Value Proposition

- Optimize entire referral lifecycle for specialty clinics
	- From receiving referral to scheduling completion
	- Convert 7-day processing to minutes
	- Expand capacity from 100 to 200 referrals/day with current staffing
- Multi-modal data foundation approach
	- Any document format/source centralized first
	- Downstream tasks: insurance checks, scheduling, coordination, clinical urgency/triage
- Current partnership with Steady for insurance verification

### Target Market & Go-to-Market

- Primary ICP: Independently operated specialty clinics (10-15 providers)
	- Orthopedics, cardiology, oncology focus
	- Procedural-heavy specialties with complex care journeys
- Initial health system targeting paused
	- Problem validated at Providence, Kaiser, Sutter
	- Moved to private practices due to speed/stage mismatch
- Challenge: Finding subset of practices actively seeking tech solutions
	- Using LinkedIn activity, podcast appearances for outreach

### Market Insights & Opportunities

- Network effects potential in geography-based referral patterns
- Attribution ROI challenges noted from previous market player (Solstice Health)
	- Difficult to prove direct patient throughput correlation
	- Admin staff shadow work complications
- PE/MSO interest but hard to identify right targets
- Examples discussed:
	- Autonomy (neurology MSO) seeking referral/prior auth solutions
	- Mandolin’s $10M raise success with top-down PE approach
	- Chamber Cardio, Welsh Carson portfolio opportunities
