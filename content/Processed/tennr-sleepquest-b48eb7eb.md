**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about AI solutions within healthcare, companies like Tennr. To kick things off, could you just give us a little bit of background on yourself as well as your company just to get a sense of the rough scale of what you guys do?

**Expert**
Yes, I'm the president and COO of SleepQuest. We're a roughly 30-year-old durable medical equipment company that specializes in sleep care management. Meaning that we do both home sleep testing and do the CPAP setups and then the CPAP resupply. We're about $17 million in revenue. Have roughly 17,000 patients currently under management.

**Client**
Super helpful. Do you have a rough sense of how many FTEs and contractors you employ?

**Expert**
Absolutely. We currently have 52 full-time employees and we don't have any temporary 1099.

**Client**
Definitely makes sense. Can you just walk me through the pain points that you experienced at SleepQuest that led you to Tennr?

**Expert**
It really starts with a broad scope from the standpoint that late 2023 we got a couple of notifications that there were going to be price increases from some of our key suppliers, namely ResMed and Brightree. ResMed obviously supplies us with the PAPs as well as resupply, the masks, tubings. Brightree which is our outsourced ERP system that we run everything through, the platform the business is built, and it was a percentage increase in December of 2023.

We started to get more price increases in first quarter of 2024 and actually gotten second price increases in December or January of this year, which really puts a lot of pressure from a financial standpoint on service providers like us. The reason why is because we don't set pricing.

Medicare and private payers tell us what they'll reimburse us on a fee-for-service basis for each of the different services or products that we dispense. On our side, we're the ones that are aggregating all these costs from the supplier vendors and then SG&A expenses, all those increasing. It's not just price increases from outside sources.

Inflation for wages, shipping, you name it, everybody's taking a price increase. We're aggregating all these costs and expenses. The goal therefore is to try to figure out a way to reduce cost of goods and SG&A expense so that you do have a profit at the end of the year, which is increasingly difficult in the last 18 months. We saw that coming and engaged with Tennr and a couple other sources to look at ways that we could outsource more of our services to do really two things.

---

The first one is a reduction in our costs and expenses. The second thing would be to be able to allow us to more quickly provision patients on whatever they needed and speeding up, closing the time gap between when we get the referral, run through eligibility and benefits, whether that's going through Medicare or private payer, get the product dispensed and start the AR cycle. Those are two really important things for us.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. It'd just be helpful if you could walk through your use cases with Tennr and what the workflow looks like with Tennr now.

**Expert**
We looked at a bunch of different resources and quickly got down to Tennr pretty damn fast. We engaged them in late February, early March of 2024 and what we thought was going to be probably a three to six month development period actually ended up being much longer than that, actually closer to a year.

The reason why we chose Tennr was because they had a lot of experience API into Brightree. There are a lot of other guys that said, "Yes, we can learn that," and that sort of thing. It's really not something you learned. It's taken us decades, I'm not exaggerating, to really become very proficient in understanding how to work Brightree. To API into it, it's not as easy as some of these AI and other process automation RPA guys were saying it was going to be.

Tennr had that experience and showed us some use cases in which they'd done it before for previous clients. We go, "Okay, we like this." That was part one. Part two was that they would allow us to actually do custom build workflows and not just pull something off the shelf and then tweak it for us, because our business is one where we have a certain process that's actually different from other DMEs. It allows us to be very efficient getting those referrals from coming in and then creating a sales order and to getting them completed, which then allows them to start the process. We love that about them. They put senior people on it.

They're able to work with us in terms of how to tweak these things and how to configure that Tennr in such a way that would allow us to do the things we wanted, reduce costs and then of course speed of service. The areas that they're specifically working for us is in documentation.

Taking inbound taxes and then bringing the sales order, putting them into our system and providing safe checks to make sure that we have all the information that we need autonomously. Typically, that would have been done manually. Taking that information once we do get a completed referral that has all the information that we need to then be able to submit to insurance, then it just goes through a process where one of our people looks at it. "Yes, it's all there."

Double checking it, clicking it and then it then goes and then fills out all the information that gets put into whether that's going through Medicare or Blue Cross Blue Shield, any of the Blues, UnitedHealthcare, whatever insurance that we're on will then plug it into the E&B process for the patient to get an authorization to proceed with service, what will be reimbursed by insurance or to what degree it will be reimbursed by their insurance. Does that make sense? The last piece would be that once that's done, it'll help us more quickly do the payment posting internally. Those are the areas that we're using Tennr.

**Client**
Super helpful. Could you describe the payment posting workflow? What is Tennr doing for you there?

**Expert**
We actually just started that, so I'm not quite sure what that is. It's the last thing to be done. We put off development on that until we make sure we have the documentation done and so that the qualifications, E&D done.

We haven't really done the payment posting. We've scoped it very peripherally, but we haven't actually started working the development on it yet. I can't really comment on that yet, but that's something that it's a lot easier lift than doing the documentation workflow and then the E&B. I have no doubt that we're going

---

to nail it pretty fast.

**Client**
Could you maybe just describe what payment posting is at your company, what the workflow is today and what you hope Tennr will do for you?

**Expert**
It's complex because we currently use Brightree payment posting. Brightree then would take all the information that is submitted and then posted the authorizations back and then built it in such a way that once we receive the payment gets posted to the right accounts and it's all done pretty autonomously, but the problem with Brightree is it's pretty expensive because of them doing it and we're going to be able to take a pretty big chunk out of that expense. I can't really speak to the nitty-gritty details of it. Brightree has a nice solution for it, but again, it's too freaking expensive.

**Client**
The payment posting is just like you get the payment from the insurance company and then is that just sending it to your bank account?

**Expert**
It's taking and making sure once we receive the payment that it's reconciled. The bank part, that's the easiest part of the whole damn thing. It's making sure the payment posting is done in such a way that it's covering all our costs. The payment that we get does match up to what was authorized.

The thing about it is that all these insurances are different. There may be a certain percentage that the patient is responsible for, that the insurance doesn't cover 100% of it. We have to go back and talk to the patient, say, "Hey, your insurance covered this much of it, you need to pay this much," which is a tremendous hassle because that requires a lot of people emailing and calling and doing follow-ups.

One of the things that we've done in terms of changes of our policies, we require that we get a credit card for patient responsibility for payment. If they ghost us, we'd just hit their credit card because they've already signed an agreement that they were going to cover all the costs.

**Client**
Makes a lot of sense. Going back to the Tennr implementation, you mentioned that you thought it would take three months and ended up taking closer to a year. Can you just walk us through what the implementation process was like and why it was delayed?

**Expert**
I don't want to go into details because the reason why it took so long is that we are, I can't think of a better term than just anal. We're just anal about it. When we put in a request to the insurance company to get an authorization to provide the service, we want to make sure that every single thing is in there and is 99.9% perfect. That way the process is much smoother after that point. There are a lot of DMEs that aren't as fastidious or anal as we are. What happens is then they have all this other back end work that they have to do. What they say, "Garbage in, garbage out." We want to make sure that everything is gold going in, so it's gold coming out is how we look at it.

The Tennr guys, even though we're probably a pain in the ass to them, really like us a lot because they saw how we did our workflows and what we were requiring, and they're going, "Oh my God, this is amazing. We see why you do it the way you do it and why that's the best way to operate your business."

What you have to understand is, for the most part, generally speaking, the durable medical equipment business is one that's not characterized by being high efficiency, high efficacy operations. At the end of the day, a DME is a distributor. What most DMEs just want to do is they just want to get the referral with the prescription, dispense the equipment and collect the money and move on.

---

They don't want to provide much service on it and they just want to ship stuff, because they're a sales organization, but what a lot of DMEs don't understand is that CPAP therapy is a lot more complicated than that because service is required on it. You have to educate the patient more about their disease state because they have obstructive sleep apnea. You have to educate them on what the equipment does, how it works. You fit them, make sure that they get the right mask and they have the right setup. Do they need a chin strap, if they're a mouth breather. Do they have facial hair? What's the best mask for them? What's the best cushion size? All these sorts of things.

Get them set up, you send them the equipment, you walk them through it, and what they're going to do that night before they go to bed, you test it out, turn on the machine. "Okay, we're looking at it. It looks like you've got a good mask seal." Sometimes the next day when they wake up, if you pull the data off the machine, you're going to say, "Oh, well, you had like three or four mask slips. There's something that we need to adjust here," and you need to work with them.

"What other issues did you have?" "Well, I had a hard time falling asleep because of the pressure." "Well, that's normal. You will get used to that. Give it some more days and you will adjust to it in terms of how you sleep with it. At the end of a couple of weeks, you're still having issues, then we'll look at maybe adjusting the pressure or maybe even look at a different device. Maybe you need a bi-level."

That requires servicing of it, which we do, a lot of DMEs that don't do that. If you look at national average for patients that are started on CPAP therapy, only 51% of the people are still on the therapy after six months. Ours is more than 85%. Most people don't get into CPAP business just to put out PAPs and initially setups, you're in it for the resupply because insurance every 90 days will pay for you to get new supplies because they wear out, they get dirty, the rubber fatigues so on and so forth.

Every 90 days, your insurance will pay for a new round of supplies. That's why we're in for the recurring income. From a business standpoint, obviously, we're in the business of getting people and keeping people healthy, but the business side of it is all about the resupply business.

**Client**
Okay. It took a little bit longer to implement. Could you give us some examples of things that were delaying it from three months to a year? What were the specific complex workflows that Tennr had to build out that weren't out of the box?

**Expert**
We have within Brightree our work process, we have just under 60 what we call WIP states work in process states. We used to call them dates, now they call them WIP states. Each one of those is a key marker within the company that tells a certain key step has been completed or is the next step to be completed.

What they had to do was they had to program our things in such a way that they would go through these various WIP states to help us be able to track it. The thing to understand is that 90% of our people are remote. That's another big change that our company's gone through in the last five years is we've gone from a retail-based DME operation where we see patients face to face.

Now 90% of our setups are all done virtually through a telehealth visit. We doubled the number of WIP states and the key processes and then tweaking it and continue to tweak it. They had to come in and to work with us, make sure that they were pulling the data at certain WIP states, make sure that those were being marked off. What this ultimately allows for us to do is if you look at our metrics, you look at the number of issues where we get a denial. An insurance company could deny a, not necessarily claim is not the right word, but a request for authorization for any number of reasons. Our denial ratio for those reasons is 5% or less.

A lot of times what DMEs will do is they'll send incomplete stuff and hoping that the insurance company won't catch it and it'll just get processed. What a lot of DMEs don't pay attention to is the fact that your payers, Medicare, they can audit you and their clawback periods can go from two, some as many as five years. If they decide to audit you and they go through and look at all the claims that you put forward, if they find issues with it, it's in the contract, you will have to repay them back the money. We don't want to carry

---

that risk as a business. That's really important to us. Long term viability is more secure than it would be if we didn't.

**Client**
Got it. Do you think that this WIP state workflow is just applicable to other DMEs, is this now productizing the Tennr where this would be applicable to any other customer or is this really just custom to you guys?

**Expert**
I would argue that it's definitely custom to us, but we don't care, Tennr can go ahead and based on the project that we have, they can work with other companies to adopt some of the workflows that we have and the rationale behind the workflows that we have.

Ultimately they have to change operations on their sides to decide to do it. Absolutely, they get it, Tennr gets it and they see the business reasons why we do what we do. They think that we operate as they keep telling us, "You guys are much more detail oriented and much more on top of your business than a lot of the clients that we have." At the end of the day if you're a DME that just wants to automate this stuff, don't really care necessarily in terms of the quality of the automation, fine.

What we're trying to do is, we're a growth company and we want to make sure that we're building on a strong foundation that is built on sound, strong business practices that don't put us at risk, because at some point you're going to get audited. We were audited six years ago by a very large national insurance company. They came back at us. Thank God it was only a two-year clawback but that was a six-figure check that we had to write. If you've ever had to go through one, you probably don't know but if you have, you'd say, "You know what, that's just too big a risk for a company by not dotting the i's and crossing the t's."

**Client**
Got it. You mentioned these 60, I think you said work states or workflows. How many of those is Tennr penetrated in or responsible for today? Is it reasonable to think of Tennr's wallet share within those workflows as their playground to play in? What do you think that looks like over time?

**Expert**
I would say that based on the current automations that we have with Tennr, it's probably no more than maybe 25, but once we start to get into payment postings and other types of things, it's probably going to be somewhere around 30-35. A lot of the WIP states are directed more towards clinical staff and what the clinical staff does, but then some of them have got to do with resupply, which Tennr doesn't necessarily touch for us, other than just doing resupply authorizations, which are relatively simple, to be honest. I hope that answers your question.

If we decide that we want to add a new WIP state because we see that we're having some issues with process flow, there's a hiccup and it's adding a day or two more because we're not doing something that we should be doing, then we'll add a new WIP state and within the Tennr system, we can go ahead and do that readily as opposed to then depending on how somebody else builds out the automation and causing major problems.

I get calls almost every day from guys talking about AI and RPA and saying, "Hey, we can help you with this sort of stuff" and I'm like any business person, I look at it and I go, "Well, what are we not doing? What am I missing here? Do they have something that maybe can help us?"

Even though I've got Tennr on board, it's the same stuff. They're just selling the glamorous positives of what AI can do for your business without really thinking through the details of what it takes for that to work for a company like ours in an industry like ours. Healthcare is very complicated because the people that use it don't necessarily pay for it. It's that weird triangle involving the provider, the payer and patient and the clinician. It's a mess.

**Client**
Yes. Just to repeat that back, you have 60 of these, I think you said WIP states and then Tennr's currently

---

touching 20-25 with payment posting go 30-35. There's just a bunch that Tennr won't touch. Especially on the clinical or resupply side, is there an opportunity and do you see them moving into the clinical side at all or is that just something where it's such a bridge and separate part of the business, where it seems untouchable?

**Expert**
I will never say never, but I will say right now we have a really good process flow in terms of what we do. There are other specific pieces of things that maybe they could do for us, but there are other people that are already focused in on that area. I'm talking specifically about clinical care. That's a possibility, but right now it's not on the board.

**Client**
Who are you using on the clinical side? Is that all through Brightree?

**Expert**
That's all through Brightree. Brightree is owned by ResMed. What is happening is because Brightree is so freaking big, they're really slow to move. They're good, the product's good, but it's expensive. I got to tell you something, if we're all going to survive in this business, we got to figure out ways to pull costs and expenses out of this equation.

It's clearly where everything is going. That point is highlighted even greater when we're talking about all these tariffs and what tariffs will do. I got to tell you that Trump administration, they throw these things out there and then they see what the response is going to be. Earlier this week or late last week where they said, "Oh, well, it's going to exclude smartphones," because it would kill Apple. They're sourcing out of China.

I got to tell you, there's a lot of medical equipment and medical supplies that comes out of China. Now all of a sudden, what's that going to do to Medicare, which is a huge burden for the federal government? What's that going to do for all the private payers now that are looking at this thing and saying, "Hey, all these costs have gone up?" Maybe they'll go up even more because of these tariffs. There's no room in the financials for providers like us to cover those costs.

**Client**
That makes sense. Just quickly on cost and how much you pay, you mentioned that Brightree is wildly expensive. Can you just share how much you pay for Brightree and how much you're spending on Tennr?

**Expert**
I can tell you that for Brightree as an outsourced service, a $17-million company, we're paying more than $1 million for all the bundled services.

**Client**
Got it. For Tennr, can you just give us relative order of magnitude? Are you paying the same? Are you paying roughly 1/10, 1/5? Are you paying double? Where does Tennr sit in relative pricing?

**Expert**
Relative pricing, it's on the order of at least being based on current pricing, it's less than half. Don't get me wrong, Tennr is not going to replace that more than $1 million, but it's going to replace a big chunk of it. The problem that you have with Brightree is a division of ResMed, a multibillion-dollar company, it takes forever for them to do any effing thing and they're servicing not only the big guys but also the small guys.

What's happened is when you have that larger company with such large share and when you take the pricing up, you create opportunities. Smaller companies come in underneath and price competitively with better product, even if the product's not better, but it's cheaper. We have no choice but to pick the cheaper product. I'll give an example of how slow they are.

Brightree is smart in that when they see a company come out that does a really good job within this arena,

---

they'll buy them. One of those companies was SnapWorx and they bought Snap and it's focused on the resupply of the business, which is more than 50% of total revenue for us and most other DMEs, that's where the money is. When they bought them, it's great software, it's a great portal, it's a great app. That was seven years ago, six years ago. It was a long time ago. The Snap software platform still is not fully integrated with the Brightree platform, they're two separate systems. They have an API between the two, but the API is really clunky.

Part of that is because before they got Snap, they had this thing called Brightree Connect, which was their technology solution to handling resupply. Snap is infinitely better. We were on Connect, we dumped it and then moved over to Snap and there's still a lot of workaround stuff and extra work that we have to do because they haven't built out the integrations between the two systems. Obviously they should collapse and it should be the same system, but they haven't done it yet. Why is it taking so long?

**Client**
That makes sense. How applicable is Tennr to folks in the market? Meaning, I imagine Tennr is probably not going to service a large healthcare system, but maybe I'm wrong. How big of a provider practice is it able to service and how small can it move down to?

**Expert**
I can tell you that in terms of Tennr's customers they do have some large enterprise level customers like $100 million revenue or higher. It's not just lower middle market companies like ours. They do have some very large and are going to be getting some more very large enterprise-level customers. Again the opportunity is created because they're currently using Brightree or Brightree Connect or Brightree Snap and what they can get from Tennr is better and cheaper.

**Client**
Is there a reason that a billion-dollar revenue a year, healthcare provider or system would not have interest in Tennr? I don't know, maybe they have enough people already or systems already.

**Expert**
I think it may be how they're configured or maybe internally, they run their own ERP system or something. There's another company that's come out, it's called the Kiva HealthCare. It's supposed to be a replacement for Brightree which I'm supposed to have a meeting here in the next couple of weeks with them. Anyways, they're actively marketing themselves as a substitute or replacement for Brightree.

**Client**
Got it. Is there a customer that would be too small for Tennr?

**Expert**
I honestly don't know. At some point you do see diminishing returns based on scale. I couldn't speak to that for them, what they would and wouldn't handle.

**Client**
If Tennr was twice the price, would it still have value for you or not anymore?

**Expert**
Based on what we're seeing from an optimization standpoint it would. What I'm trying to balance right now, I'm speaking for myself, the request is that a lot of times when you bring in a company like this and you would look at cutting your headcount, because you're able to do the work much more efficiently.

I could probably cut three or four people with these automations but I'm not because our company's growing and you're still going to need people to double check this work and stuff. For me it's about not having to add headcount as we grow. If the price doubled, it would be one of those things where I'd have to start to say, "Okay, I need to start pushing out people."

---

**Client**
Very quickly, you mentioned that you're getting hit up all the time and there are these alternatives, just from a reputation standpoint or a number two or three up and comer, what are those other names that if, let's just say you snap your fingers and God forbid, Tennr wasn't here and was out of business, who would be the one or two others that you would shift to, to solve this problem?

**Expert**
We looked at this thing back at the end of 2023 and early 2024, and I cannot remember any of the names.

**Client**
Got it. Does it feel like from a reputation standpoint if you go to the conferences and I know this is a very more tight, insular community, Tennr has really won the hearts and minds of the community, or is it still too early to tell?

**Expert**
I don't know if I can speak to the entire community. I can tell you that when I went through the process of talking to others on who to choose, that the Tennr references were outstanding. Some of them I already knew personally, as the DME community is relatively open, we talk to each other, we may compete, but honestly, there's more business to take care of.

We talk to each other about different things that are going on and solutions. I have to tell you that they've got some really good DME customers that I respect in terms of how they operate their business, and they gave me a really good referral for them. Plus, one of the co-founders was very involved in the development process and we still stay in touch.

I can tell you though, from a marketing standpoint, it's not just one of those companies that just does a really great job on software development and implementation, but those are really savvy marketers. You probably see that with their social media, they're pretty accurate, I get all those feeds.

**Client**
Great. This was helpful. Thank you for your time. Enjoy the rest of your day.
