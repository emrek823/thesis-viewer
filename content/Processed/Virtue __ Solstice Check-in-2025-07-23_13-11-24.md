### Product Differentiation & Market Positioning

- Pipeline through end of year showing strong traction
- Land and expand strategy planned for 2026
- Phase I vs. II considerations for scaling
- Differentiated GTM sophistication - showing value in first call
- Key differentiator: Solstice offers prompt-to-compliant-content in minutes vs. competitors requiring template setup, team coordination, and multi-step processes
	- Agencies can’t offer content ownership without destroying their business model
	- No other technology vendor creating compliant content end-to-end
	- MLR pre-check solutions exist but don’t create compliant content
- Customer feedback: want something end-to-end that can replace agencies 100%, not 30-50%
	- Point solutions create duplication rather than replacement
	- Must include submission to Veeva, tagging, linking for holistic solution
	- Regulatory compliance critical - can’t adjust approved claims or design elements

### Pipeline & Revenue Expansion Opportunities

- Top 6 clients (MSA/SOW approved or advanced conversations) starting at 5-6 figures
- Full breadth opportunity within key accounts:
	- Ipsen: $1-2M ACV potential “no doubt about it”
	- Fathom: high 6 figures
	- Alexion: significant expansion potential
	- Sanofi: “inevitability” - definite signing expected
- Upselling opportunities:
	- Same product across different brands within pharma companies
	- Each brand operates like separate entity with own budgets
	- Upstream/downstream capability development
- Built-in $10M ACV opportunity within existing signed client base without new contracts
- Need one whale (J&J, AZ) signed or in advanced stage for investor appeal

### Team Building & Fundraising Timeline

- Recent hire: copywriter from Publicis/Omnicom (Andrew) to ensure high-quality content
- Engineering hiring:
	- One trial candidate likely receiving offer today
	- Need 1-2 more engineers for current client serving capacity
	- Targeting “reach hires” including YC founder from Heavy considering leaving
	- Cash compensation expectations high ($300K+ for senior roles) - using equity generosity to compete
- Fundraising approach:
	- Focus on converting current pipeline first - show signed clients loving product with upsell potential
	- Timeline trigger: first 4 clients signed + 1 month proving product value
	- Investor interest exists in category and specifically Solstice as early leader
	- 25 months runway, taking burn up by $40K monthly = 18 months still sufficient
	- Strategy: relationship building conversations before formal raise to educate market and qualify investors
