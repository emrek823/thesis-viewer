# Reflections on the year, plus a dose of good cheer

‘Twas the final weeks of the year, and all throughout the land  
Digital health innovators [reflected](https://rockhealth.com/insights/healthcare-innovation-at-the-turn-of-2026-mapping-whats-now-and-whats-next-in-digital-health/), cups o’ caffeine in hand.  
The year delivered big stories, and some hype turned real,  
Capital investment concentrated in a [couple dozen mega deals](https://rockhealth.com/insights/q3-2025-market-overview-signals-out-of-sync/).  
AI became table stakes, [integrated](https://rockhealth.com/insights/h1-2025-market-overview-proof-in-the-pudding/) into infrastructure’s foundation  
And [providers embraced](https://rockhealth.com/insights/ai-is-in-the-doctors-bag-and-primary-care-is-ready-to-use-it/) [AI scribes](https://medcitynews.com/2025/06/healthcare-ai-ambient-scribe-burnout-clinician/), all across the nation.  
Access was redefined, as [DTP pharma models](https://rockhealth.com/insights/pharmas-direct-to-patient-era-building-beyond-table-stakes/) picked up steam,  
The [wearables](https://rockhealth.com/insights/screenagers-to-silver-surfers-how-each-generation-clicks-with-care/) market gained traction too—was Oura’s [$900M](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/14/oura-ringmaker-valuation-fundraise.html) raise a fever dream?  
Longevity [blew up](https://rockhealth.com/insights/healthcare-innovation-at-the-turn-of-2026-mapping-whats-now-and-whats-next-in-digital-health/), with data helping consumers live longer (or forever?)  
But don't forget about good ole [primary care](https://rockhealth.com/insights/ai-is-in-the-doctors-bag-and-primary-care-is-ready-to-use-it/)—always a worthwhile lever.  
We saw some IPOs, the exit market thawed at long last;  
[Shout out](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rock-health_rockhealthsummit-activity-7378908033441185792-q6jC?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABWOugABOVEdR7EJFzyDreTVas1fb4rKpqs) to [Omada](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/omada-health-goes-public-ipo/750115/) and [Hinge](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hinge-health-goes-public-digital-health-IPO-signal/748931/), bet those bell-ringings were a [blast](https://medcitynews.com/2025/06/omada-hinge-ipo-success/)!  
M&A was no slouch either—almost 200 digital health startups [boarded that boat](https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/08/digital-health-mergers-acquisitions-ai-private-equity/),  
Some to be woven into [strategic tapestries](https://rockhealth.com/rock-weekly/weaving-healthcares-future/), others because they’d lost their moat.  
A new federal administration created [major](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/house-votes-218-214-send-reconciliation-bill-trumps-desk) [shifts](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trumprx-website-launch-early-2026-senior-administration-official-says-2025-09-30/),  
Here’s hoping [ACCESS](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/health-tech/mh-cmmi-access-payment-model-explained/) and [ELEVATE](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-regulation/mh-cmmi-model-nutrition-maha/) ensure outcomes get a reimbursement lift!  
Were healthcare’s problems fully solved? Not quite, there’s always [room to improve](https://rockhealth.com/insights/women-in-focus-understanding-women-as-digital-health-consumers/)  
But innovators continue to [inspire](https://www.top50indigitalhealth.com/honorees), putting in work and making moves.  
Through it all, our Rock Health crew kept [tabs](https://rockhealth.com/rock-weekly/), to make the happenings clear  
Sharing insights with our community, every Monday this year.  
Now as the sun sets on 2025, with 2026 just around the bend,  
Our last Rock Weekly of the year will wrap, with this quick note to end:  
Thanks for reading, dear friends! We’re grateful for you,  
Keep fighting that good fight transforming healthcare—and to your mission stay true!

With the launch of the ACCESS payment model, digital health leaders cheered,  
Providers could be paid for tech-enabled care, and it will run for 10 years!  
Now our friends at Maverick Health Policy have weighed in to [explain](https://www.maverickhealthpolicy.com/issue-brief/rock-weekly-mavericks-access-model/),  
How digital health companies can use these policy shifts for gain.
