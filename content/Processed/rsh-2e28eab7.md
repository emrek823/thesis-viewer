Fire and transport

Sometimes the same

Some the fire department outsourced transport. That’s where AMR comes in - they outsource transport

Not all outsourced transport is private (some is public

Atlanta Fire - Fire is Fire + Transport is Grady (Hospital)

Airport - Avaiatin (Fire and Transport)

Transport has volume - they have the medics that treat the patients

Chooser and User within transport

Chooser - EMS Chief. This is a nightmaer. Can’t hire enough people, they are coming in for adrenaline,

User - medics

What makes you want to call? Vs. not want to call?

We made the assumption that medic knows if it’s non-acute and they know

“This is like if you handed me sheet of paper. 3 sentences - read this in front of 1000 people” I’m in front of patient, never done it before, never talked to RSH”

Finding ways to tip them in it “How would you like to talk to an ED doc right now”

Feedback loops about what happens to the patients

Implementation

PCR - medical record on scene

(198 EMS calls) / (All Omega and Alpha rides)

Alpha call
