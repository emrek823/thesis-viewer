### Team Overview

- Tech team comprises 50 people across product, design, engineering and data science
- Acknowledged slower initial uptake of AI/LLMs but gained significant momentum in last 3-6 months
- Recent focus on supporting new health plan go-lives in 2025 impacted AI experimentation timeline

### AI Implementation Categories

- Code Generation

- 87% of engineers use GitHub Copilot or Cursor daily
- Implemented Luminai (RPA tool vendor) allowing non-engineers to generate RPA workflows using plain language prompts
- Focus on automating deterministic workflows across systems

- Data Summarization & Recommendations

- Built internal care management tool (ThymeBox) with integrated LLMs
- Implemented chat interface allowing care team to query member data
- Enhanced SOP guidance - directs care team to right workflows at right time
- Developed QA system for call transcripts using rubrics
- Created ThymeCare Connect (web app) for lower-risk member engagement
- Uses AI for personalized content recommendations vs. hard-coded rules

- Agentic Workflows

- Limited implementation currently
- Focus on voice AI applications
- Minimal transactional calls (no appointment scheduling/eligibility checks) due to at-risk contract model
- Planning future deployment for care team task offloading

### Workflow Improvements & ROI

- Primary focus on gross margin expansion and care delivery cost reduction
- Key improvements in documentation:
	- AI transcription and summarization for telephonic interactions
	- Auto-completion of structured documentation forms/assessments
	- Automated navigation summary generation and distribution to providers
- Admin assistant role evolution:
	- Automating manual workflows
	- Natural attrition vs. layoffs
	- Shifting focus toward member-facing care partner roles

### Care Team Structure & Metrics

- Panel size managed by role (12-15 distinct roles)
- Includes specialized roles: oncology nurses, transition care nurses, palliative care management
- Current ratio: ~550 members per care team member
- Continuously optimize staffing ratios through top-down and bottom-up assessment
- Focus on Per Engaged Member Per Month (PEPM) cost
- Evaluate ROI of incremental headcount against total cost of care savings
- At-risk contracts drive focus on optimizing savings vs. pure efficiency

### Next Steps & Interests

- Seeking connections with product/engineering leaders pushing AI adoption envelope
- Interest in learning from others’ experiences with AI cultural integration
- Focus on driving urgency in AI adoption across organization
