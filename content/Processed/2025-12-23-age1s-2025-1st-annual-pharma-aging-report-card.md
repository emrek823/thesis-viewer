Only decades ago, aging research remained a niche curiosity sequestered to a handful of academic labs across the world. But long gone are the days when longevity was a fringe pursuit struggling for funding and mainstream attention. Today, top pharma companies are pouring millions into trials, partnerships, and acquisitions in the longevity space, signaling a fundamental shift in how aging is perceived: from uninvestable to a field poised for near-term progress.

As an early-stage investor, age1 is dedicated to backing individuals—founders with cutting-edge, visionary projects and ideas that could add healthy years and decades to human life. Yet startup audacity and corporate scale are not opposites so much as complements: nimble teams can scout novel mechanisms, while pharma excels at industrializing proven science. Growing corporate interest in the aging field inspired age1 to compile this leaderboard: a map of who inside pharma is leading in longevity, and in what ways.

*Why is this list important?*

1. Pragmatically, most early-stage companies would be extremely fortunate to get to Phase I/II trials backed only by VC funding—Series A/B funding may be just enough to run a Phase I and launch a proof-of-concept Phase II before the next round, but to run a Phase III trial can cost hundreds of millions and take multiple years. Unless the company is prepared to IPO with less clinical data, their best bet may be to partner with or be acquired by pharma. Founders who understand which companies have already staked claims in metabolic disease, neurodegeneration, fibrosis, or immune rejuvenation can craft a story that fits those partners’ strategic gap.
2. We hope that this report card also serves as a call to action for pharma. Facing unprecedented patent cliffs, top pharma companies cannot afford to miss out on one of the very few therapeutic areas with a market size significantly larger than the obesity market. Moreover, large-scale pharma companies have the unique resources and scale to effect transformative change in aging therapeutics through several strategic levers: establishing dedicated internal units focused explicitly on longevity and age-related disease, forging partnerships with innovative startups developing relevant platforms and therapies, directing their venture arms toward promising investments in the aging space, and more. Thus, this report card ideally offers pharmaceutical leaders a snapshot of where bold investment can still capture first-mover advantage and where they sit compared to their peers.

If we have missed any important data or insights that would enrich this article, we invite our audience to share with us; we are always open to feedback!

**Without further ado, welcome to age1’s 2025 Pharma Report Card.**

***Note**: All corporate partnership deal amounts include upfront payment and milestones* *(with the exception of Gero x Roche, for which upfront sum was undisclosed). Investment data was sourced from company press releases since 2020, as well as platforms such as Pitchbook, Crunchbase, and Tracxn, and validated by search. For the purpose of this report, "aging-thesis driven" refers to companies that explicitly publicly identify as focused on aging and longevity.*

**Merck & Co. (C-)**

Merck is widely known for its work in oncology and vaccines, as well as its recent successes in treating cardiovascular conditions. The company’s greatest development in the age-related disease space is its development of enlicitide, the first oral macrocyclic PCSK9 inhibitor if approved. This June, Merck announced [positive results from the first two of three Phase III trials of the drug](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-positive-topline-results-from-the-first-two-phase-3-coralreef-trials-evaluating-enlicitide-decanoate-for-the-treatment-of-adults-with-hyperlipidemia/), making it highly likely that the drug will soon advance to FDA approval. Alongside enlicitide, Merck is also running a Phase 2a clinical study of frespaciguat, an inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator for pulmonary hypertension. The company’s leadership in cardiovascular disease extends to its portfolio: in 2021, Merck completed a $11.5 billion acquisition of [Acceleron Pharma](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-to-acquire-acceleron-pharma-inc/), securing Winrevair—a first-in-class TGF-β/activin signaling modulator to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension granted [FDA approval](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/merck-walks-away-key-fda-approval-pah-drug-winrevair) in 2024. And just this March, Merck entered a licensing agreement for [HRS-5346](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-enters-exclusive-license-agreement-for-hrs-5346-an-investigational-oral-lipoproteina-inhibitor-for-cardiovascular-disease-from-jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-co-ltd/), an oral small molecule Lp(a) inhibitor currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in China.

Merck has generally steered clear of any explicit longevity initiatives, but its venture arm has made modest investments in neurodegeneration. Merck Ventures was also a seed investor in [Asceneuron](https://www.m-ventures.com/portfolio/asceneuron), a spinoff company resulting from EMD Serono’s (a division of Merck) Entrepreneur Partnership Program building enzyme O-GlcNAcase (OGA) inhibitors that prevent the aggregation of tau proteins. Blocking O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to decrease amyloid plaque and [improve cognitive function](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7199460/) in aged mouse models. Unfortunately, Asceneuron unexpectedly [halted its own Phase II trial](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/asceneuron-halts-alzheimers-trial-adding-to-tau-targeting-setbacks/) of lead Alzheimer’s disease (AD) candidate ASN51 this March, but remains hopeful about its other clinical-stage tau-targeting therapies such as ASN90, currently in trials for the treatment of progressive supranuclear palsy. Nonetheless, Merck’s [collaboration with Neuphoria on MK-1167](https://www.nasdaerapeutics-inc-reportq.com/articles/neuphoria-ths-q1-2025-progress-and-upcoming-milestones-bnc210-and-mk), an alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor allosteric modulator, remains promising, as the drug is currently in Phase II trials. In 2019 and 2023, the company acquired [Calporta](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/merck-buys-calporta-therapeutics/) and [Caraway](https://longevity.technology/news/merck-bolsters-neurodegeneration-program-with-caraway-acquisition/) (formerly Rheostat Therapeutics), respectively, both of which are developing drugs that target TRPML1, a lysosomal ion channel critical for cellular waste clearance. Impaired lysosomal function is increasingly recognized as a central driver of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD, due to its role in clearing misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. However, the payout on these investments, exceeding $500 million each, [remains unclear](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/TRPML1_Agonists.pdf), as Merck has not shared any status updates on the development of its TRPML1 agonist preclinical program.

Merck’s strategy of pouring capital into derisked targets (PCSK9, TGF‑β/activin, sGC) and developing novel formulations (oral, inhaled) has resulted in well-executed, faster time‑to‑revenue drugs in cardiometabolic disease, but the company remains hesitant to bet on aging biology, either internally or externally. Venture investments in neurodegeneration remain aging-adjacent, and, like many of its peers, Merck has not publicized efforts to enter partnerships or collaborations with aging-thesis driven companies.

**Sanofi (C-)**

Sanofi, traditionally a leader in immunology and neuroinflammation, has taken a somewhat unconventional path into longevity R&D—while the French pharma does not have an aging unit like AstraZeneca or Eli Lilly, it has engaged in trials and investments that demonstrate a recognition that diseases of aging present huge opportunities, particularly in neurodegeneration and inflammation, two fields for which the company is arguably most well-known. Most recent is its [May 2025 $470 million buyout of Vigil Neuroscience](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2025/2025-05-21-23-15-31-3086232) to acquire VG-3927, a small molecule agonist of the TREM2 protein expected to enhance microglial function in AD. In 2024, Sanofi quietly announced a [$27 million investment in Ventyx](https://ir.ventyxbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ventyx-biosciences-announces-27-million-strategic-investment), which is developing VTX3232, an NLRP3 inhibitor that can cross the blood-brain barrier. Chronic NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been shown to accelerate age-related diseases and conditions such as [AD, Parkinson’s Disease (PD), metabolic disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00650-z), and even [frailty](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10855188/). VTX3232 has already demonstrated [success in safety and target engagement trials](http://ir.ventyxbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ventyx-biosciences-announces-positive-top-line-data-its-phase-2a), with the results of subsequent studies expected later this year. In 2023, Sanofi Ventures also joined Novo Holdings in a [$55 million Series B for NodThera](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novo-sanofi-lead-55m-round-for-inflammation-player-nodthera), which is developing a similar small-molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, highlighting the company’s clear focus on anti-inflammatory therapeutics—notably, 44 of its 86 clinical-stage projects are immunology and inflammation, comprising more than half of its [pipeline](https://www.sanofi.com/en/our-science/our-pipeline).

Beyond investments, Sanofi’s clinical [pipeline](https://www.sanofi.com/en/our-science/our-pipeline) also includes some standouts: Frexalimab, a CD40-CD40L pathway inhibitor, is currently in Phase III trials for the treatment of Nonrelapsing Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (nrSPMS). Like AbbVie, Sanofi is also developing a gene therapy for wet age-related macular disease (SAR402663), albeit only in Phase I/II. The company is also running Phase I trials of a first-in-class trispecific nanobody for knee osteoarthritis (SAR446959), simultaneously inhibiting key cartilage-degrading enzymes (MMP13 and ADAMTS5) and anchoring the nanobody to the affected cartilage. Sanofi also boasts a promising vaccine pipeline, including three mRNA vaccines for RSV aimed at older adults. In 2022, Sanofi made a blockbuster $1.2 billion deal with [Insilico Medicine](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/amid-biotech-winter-insilico-turns-heat-sanofi-deal-worth-12b-biobucks) to advance candidates for up to six new targets using the company’s [Pharma.AI](http://pharma.ai) platform.

Ultimately, however, Sanofi sits at a C‑ because the company’s work in aging is currently a patchwork of late‑stage, disease‑centric projects (TREM2 for AD, NLRP3 for PD, trispecific nanobodies for osteoarthritis) rather than a cohesive longevity strategy. Sanofi’s alliance with an aging-thesis driven company like Insilico is promising, but it remains unclear whether Sanofi will use the company’s platform to develop assets in age-related disease, and the company has yet to establish an in-house aging group or publicly promote investment in the targeting of aging as a primary condition.

**Pfizer (C)**

Long known for its strengths in oncology, immunology, and vaccine development, Pfizer has slowly started to position itself as a participant in the longevity space. While Pfizer lacks a specialized aging division, the company has made its commitment to aging research explicit through investments and public campaigns. In 2022, Pfizer Ventures made a [$500,000 investment in VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/blog-article/vitadao-closes-4-1m-fundraising-round-with-pfizer-and-shine-capital), a community collective organization that funds longevity researchers. One year later, Pfizer entered a research [collaboration with Gero](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/longevity-biotech-gero-entered-research-collaboration) to discover drug targets for fibrotic diseases.

The company’s venture arm has also made four significant investments in neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. In 2017, Pfizer [joined AbbVie in backing Aquinnah](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/aquinnah-pharmaceuticals-receives-10-million-investment)’s RNA-binding protein approach for ALS/AD as mentioned earlier, and, in 2019, co-led funding in lysosomal dysfunction biotech [Arkuda Therapeutics](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arkuda-therapeutics-closes-44m-series-a-financing-to-advance-novel-medicines-targeting-progranulin-and-lysosomal-biology-to-treat-neurodegenerative-diseases-300953389.html) (notably, Eli Lilly joined Arkuda in the following Series B round, making the biotechnology company one to watch). In 2020, Pfizer Ventures invested $15 million into [Mission Therapeutics](https://missiontherapeutics.com/mission-raises-15m-and-expands-its-relationship-with-pfizer/) (joining Roche), a biotech developing selective deubiquitinase inhibitors to enhance mitophagy, and just this March, Pfizer contributed to a $31 millio
