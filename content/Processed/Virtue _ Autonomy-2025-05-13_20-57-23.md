### Deal Terms & Structure

- Angels + sole firm in Virtue
- Round details proposed:
	- $2M minimum round size (up to $2.5M optional)
	- $12.5M post-money valuation
	- 16-20% dilution range depending on final amount
	- Virtue to take 10% ($1.025M commitment)
	- Clean vanilla SAFE structure with standard information rights and pro-rata

### Valuation Rationale (per Sean)

- Priced above typical pre-seed ($8-10M) due to company’s current stage
- Positioned for favorable Series A metrics:
	- Target Series A post-money: $40-60M
	- Aiming for 3x multiple in 18 months
	- Comparable MSO valuations at 12.5-15x gross profit multiple
	- Current market seeing lower Series A/B graduation rates

### Next Steps

- Team to discuss internally and respond via text
- Upon alignment:
	- Virtue to send executable term sheet immediately
- Legal process estimated at 1 day
- Potential wire timing:
	- Earliest: End of current week
	- Latest: Early/mid next week
- Additional investors:
	- Space for angels and practices to participate
	- 30-day window for additional participants
	- Interest from New York group and Texas doctors
