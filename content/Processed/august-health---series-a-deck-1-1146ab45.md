## Slide 1: Series A
# augusthealth
The modern platform for senior living

## Slide 2: Mission
# MISSION
Empower the essential workers caring for our elders

*(Image shows a person interacting with a tablet displaying a form for "Identification and Emergency Information" for a resident, including sections for "AMBULATORY STATUS" with options like "Walks without device or support," "Walks with cane," "Walks with walker or other support," "Uses wheelchair," "Bedridden able to turn self," and "Bedridden unable to turn self." There's also a question about mental competence for evacuation instructions.)*

## Slide 3: Massive trends unlock a unique opportunity
### GREY WAVE
*   Boomers turn 80 in 2026
*   2x of 85+ population by 2036
*   Shortage of 3.8M family caregivers by 2030

### LONG-TERM CARE REFORM
*   $415B cost/year - 2X to 3% of GDP by 2050
*   40% of Medicaid spend (6% of recipients)
*   Policy reforms to bend cost curve & promote Skilled Nursing alternatives

### VERTICAL SAAS
*   Replace manual processes in legacy industries
*   Own workflows and activate data
*   Multiply revenue 2-5x with fintech, commerce, and services

### VALUE-BASED CARE
*   Dense congregation of high-risk patients
*   Growing market of payers/providers incentivized to enroll residents and manage quality and costs

## Slide 4: The long tail of senior living is underserved by technology
*   43,000 Assisted Living communities
*   1.5M residents
*   $119B in annual rent\* (mostly via paper checks)
*   Untouched market of independent operators
*   74% of communities run on paper
*   Unwieldy legacy solutions don't work

### COMMUNITIES BY SIZE
| Beds        | Percentage |
| :---------- | :--------- |
| 101+ BEDS   | 4%         |
| 26-100 BEDS | 31%        |
| 1-25 BEDS   | 65%        |

## Slide 5: Communities are struggling
### QUALITY OF CARE
*   Medication error rate - 42%
*   Critical documentation missing
*   Assessments & care plans substandard
*   Health trends hidden; 60% of ER visits are preventable
*   Clinicians can't access information

### BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS
*   Staffing inefficiency - 81% report staff shortages
*   Inadequate visibility into staffing ratios
*   67% of communities cited for non-compliance
*   Care fees not optimized

The system of record is a three-ring binder. Data is trapped on paper.

## Slide 6: Why digitize now?
*   87% of communities report a surge in acuity levels
*   Rise of healthcare payors and care coordination demands
*   Over the last 4 years, 84% of states adopted more onerous regulations
*   New generation of owners looking to professionalize and scale

*(Image shows various physical paper records, including a "Mills Estate Villa" binder, COVID-19 related records, and a "MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION RECORD" with handwritten entries and blister packs of medication.)*

## Slide 7: We've built an elegant, modern platform for senior living communities

DOWN THE ROAD

## Slide 24: Customer Profile: High Desert Haven
### BACKGROUND
High Desert Haven is a rural assisted living and memory care provider serving 80 high needs residents from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Their operations were 100% paper-based.

### REFERRAL → CLOSE
The community's preferred podiatrist saw August Health in use at another facility and referred us because he found his job easier and more efficient at August-run communities. The owner signed after a one-hour zoom call — $14,740 in ARR (intro price for the first year).

### IMPLEMENTATION
We trained staff on one zoom call. They added all residents and data within a week. They adopted our Care Level feature for tiered pricing.

*(Image shows residents seated at tables in a dining/common area. Below it is the logo for "High Desert Haven Assisted Living & Memory Care Facility".)*

## Slide 29: Case Study: Value-based care partnership
*(Logo for Institute on Aging and Santa Clara Family Health Plan.)*

Institute on Aging and August Health have partnered to issue joint proposals to Managed Care Plans for RCFE capacity-building services throughout California. The first contract was just signed with SCFHP.

These services will enable Managed Care Plans to rapidly develop RCFE networks to serve their members with high-quality assisted living services instead of costly placements in Skilled Nursing Facilities.

## Slide 30: PRODUCT FEATURE: Care Levels
*   Most communities don't have robust tools to price based on acuity
*   With informal assessments or paper systems, communities leave care fees on the table
*   There is no visibility into optimizing staffing needs based on acuity mix

Our tool systematizes care levels, captures value, and increases revenue.

*(Image shows a person interacting with a tablet displaying a form for "Identification and Emergency Information" for a resident, including sections for "AMBULATORY STATUS" with various options.)*

## Slide 31: PRODUCT FEATURE: Billing & Rent Payments
*   Annual revenue $119.2 Billion
*   Even at larger communities, staff spend days creating invoices, opening paper envelopes, and driving to the bank
*   With our invoicing and payments feature, staff efficiency and improved collections easily offset our take (0.15-0.35%)

*(Image shows a screenshot of the August Health platform displaying a "Billing" section for "Randall Fischer." Details include:)*
