### Charles Yang Background & Journey

- Materials science major at Berkeley, switched to CS due to AI focus
- Two research labs: mechanical engineering and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (AI for scientific discovery)
- AI hardware startup experience as ML engineer
- Department of Energy (2023-February 2025): AI policy advisor, helped establish AI office
	- Worked with 17 national labs on AI for Science strategy
- Currently: AI for Science fellow at Renaissance Philanthropy
	- Organized autonomous science instruments workshop (October, San Diego)
	- 50 attendees: researchers, startups, investors including Thermo Fisher, Sefla, Lab Rack

### “Anduril for Science Instruments” Thesis

- Core insight: Need to sell solutions, not individual products (like Anduril’s evolution from Lattice to defense prime)
- Lab automation market assessment:
	- Current wedge for most companies but pretty crowded
	- Companies like Periodic and Lila building individual modalities
	- Most will get acquired or go bankrupt - lack portfolio vision
- Electron microscopy opportunity:
	- Less competition, higher complexity instruments
	- Focus on scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
	- Generates 10-20 gigabytes/second, terabyte per run
	- Researchers using outdated hardware (P5000 Nvidia, RTX 69)
	- Semiconductor fabs have 30+ instruments of various modalities

### Market Strategy & Technical Approach

- Initial wedge: STEM software for semiconductor industry
	- Edge compute required (can’t stream 20GB/sec to cloud)
	- Academic pilots → paid industrial licenses model (following CryoSpark playbook)
- Expansion path:
- Technical differentiation:
	- STEM generates most data of any instrument
	- Can potentially compete with cryo-EM for some applications
	- CZI imaging institute bullish on STEM as new modality

### Next Steps & Team Building

- Moving to Boston (near Longwood Medical Center) in 2 weeks
- 6-8 week goals:
	- Get GUI feedback from national lab contacts
	- Secure pilot commitments from labs
	- Identify two key hires: physics grad student + full-stack ML engineer
- Connected to David Mueller (STEM inventor, Cornell):
	- Two graduating students interested
	- Works with all major semiconductor fabs (IBM, TSMC engineers visit lab)
- Follow-up call with National Renewable Energy Lab researcher
- Not actively fundraising currently - will reconnect in 2-3 months
