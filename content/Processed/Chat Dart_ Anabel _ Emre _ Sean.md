### Anabel’s Positive Feedback on Virtue VC

- Viraj and Aakruti have “really good things to say about your approach”
- “You’ve left a good impression”
- Major props to the team’s engagement style

### Chat Dart Founder Background & Profile

- Viraj (19) and Aakruti (20) when Anabel invested in 2021
	- Childhood neighbors from Orange County
	- Aakruti dropped out of Berkeley (sophomore year)
	- Relationship status unclear (“can’t confirm or deny if they’re a couple”)
- Initial investment: $650K round in 2021 at idea stage
	- Only capital they’ve ever raised
	- Original concept: operating system for independent contractors
- Key founder strengths:
	- “Really speedy feedback loops and constantly iterating”
	- “Following the energy wherever it is - no fear, shame, nothing in their way”
	- “Shameless” approach to tackling hard problems
	- Young problem-solving mentality with generational advantages

### Pivot Journey & Current State

- Discovery phase lasted years with multiple pivots
- Healthcare insight driven by Viraj’s mom (runs independent clinic)
- Current focus evolution:
	- Started with independent clinics and compliance
	- Moved to hospice data capture (unstructured data for compliance)
	- Now expanding to entire hospital systems
	- “90 days since they thought about hospital systems”
- Geographic moves:
	- Worked from 43’s office daily during Puzzle phase
	- Moved home to conserve runway during pivot
	- Relocated to NYC to get closer to healthcare customers

### Market Positioning & Readiness

- Achieved “feature market fit” - ready for segmentation phase
- “They’ve landed in this zone of healthcare and really need help”
- Energized by Virtue VC’s market perspective:
	- Understanding consolidation trends
	- Portfolio approach aligns with their vision
- Current challenge: need seasoned healthcare operator
	- Will be expensive hire
	- Potential culture clash with young team
	- Need mental and financial preparation

### Investment Strategy & Market Dynamics

- Virtue VC approach resonated strongly:
	- 10% ownership target (flexible)
	- Heavy lifting on diligence and market positioning
	- Portfolio support and peer community access
	- Hospital/health system LP relationships
- Fundraising sentiment shift:
	- Started call at ~30% chance of raising
	- Ended at ~50% chance after Virtue VC conversations
- Post-ZIRP reality check:
	- Need $1M ARR to be compelling
	- Previous fundraising attempts felt “overlooked”
	- Now have “the swagger” needed for fundraising
- Competition: also talking to Twine (Ethan)
	- Virtue VC perceived as “much more relevant and savvy”

### Next Steps & Strategic Considerations

- Meeting tomorrow with Viraj (hopefully all in person)
- Key selling points for raising now vs. waiting:
	- Market timing concerns (“it’s kinda bleak right now”)
	- AI creating “brave new world” uncertainties
	- Series A graduation rates “piss poor” in healthcare
	- Virtue VC’s 100% Series A grad rate advantage
- Recommendation: focus on selling “why raise now” rather than competing against other firms
- “You’re arguing against whether or not they raise, not against another firm”
