- Tech Providers
- RCM Software

## Summary
The conversation between the Tegus Client and the expert centered on the automation and adoption of technology in the revenue cycle industry, emphasizing the importance of minimizing human intervention and increasing automation to streamline processes. They discussed challenges faced by healthcare organizations in adopting technology, the competitive tension between outsourced service providers and tech vendors, and the potential for AI-driven companies to be acquired by larger providers. The conversation also highlighted the need to consider revenue cycle experience and integration with payers to maximize automation benefits.

## Expert Details
**Former Vice President Of Enterprise Analytics at R1 RCM Inc.**
Leaving in January 2025. The expert is a former competitor of Waystar and has had experience with other RCM Platforms.

**Chief Operating Officer at The Cycling House.**
Reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, the expert is responsible for the day-to-day administration and operation of the business.

Prior to The Cycling House, the expert was the Vice President of Enterprise Analytics at R1 RCM, leaving in January 2025. Reporting to the Chief Information Officer, the expert was responsible for the executive leadership of multi-year initiatives to develop and deploy a modern data and analytics ecosystem. Their remit included Product Management, Data Warehousing, Governance, and Reporting Operations while managing global teams. Also at R1 RCM, the expert served as the Vice President of Technology Integration and Product Management, where they led the product and technology integration of a $200 million revenue Physician Revenue Cycle Management acquisition.

The expert can speak to enterprise analytics, the development and deployment of data and analytics ecosystems, data warehousing, and governance. Additionally, they can discuss post-acquisition technology integration, product management, and operations management within the revenue cycle management industry.

### Q: In what capacity are you familiar with Waystar and Availity?
**A:** I've worked in hospitals and RCM outsourcing vendors that have used both Waystar and Availity. The chief product officer at Availity is, in fact, a former manager of mine at R1. In addition to using their solutions, R1 RCM also developed proprietary features and solutions that competed with these tools, and I've worked with Cerner, Epic, NextGen, Meditech, and other Revenue cycle management platforms that offered their own embedded versions of all of these solutions.

### Q: Can you comment on competitive dynamics between the various players in this space? Who do you think is the best positioned provider and why?
**A:** There are 3 main competitive segments as I alluded to earlier. There are the vertically integrated EHR system providers, RCM vendors like R1 with natively built solutions powering their service delivery, and then aggregators of services companies like Availity, Waystar, but also Change Healthcare, Relay, and Trizetto. I expect what we'll see is growing consolidation of point solution providers to form more robust service offerings with deeper client bases that increase the economies of scale to provide services in each vertical.

# Document Content

At the moment Waystar likely has the edge based on breadth of services and customer satisfaction but also in install base. In RCM services and technology it is extraordinarily complex to swap vendors in and out so incumbents generally have to do something pretty badly for organizations to consider swapping.

## Q: Do you have a sense of competitive dynamics between standalone RCM software companies versus RCM software modules of EHR companies?
### A:
All in all, I think the EHR vendors have a strong advantage and particularly EPIC who has almost 50% market share, and has won about 70% of all contracts out for bid in the last year. They will develop competitive solutions that will crowd out point solutions over time because of the higher quality integration and interoperability of their solutions. The 5 year opportunity in the market is likely in the space where EPIC is distracted from developing these solutions while it focuses on digesting all its new business. If these companies can collect market share in point solutions, their business will have some elasticity but in the end, I see EHR vendors winning.

### Client
We're doing some market research into RCM software, and given your background here, thought it'd be helpful to better understand the key players, the market trends, and so on. To start off, it'd be helpful if you could share an overview of your background and then we can take it from there.

### Expert
I have been in the revenue cycle industry for about 25 years working for companies like R1 RCM, Healthcare Business Insights, and The Advisory Board. I have worked both in operations and in product and technology at firms that support revenue cycle operations.

Five years at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City where I managed call centers, and payer follow-up, and denials management, and appeals functions at Intermountain. Long history leading data analytics teams for R1 RCM and The Advisory Board, providing revenue cycle management data and analytics, insights, and reporting.

### Client
Got it. To start off, would you have a sense of what the overall spending on RCM activities is in the U.S.? I've seen some different industry figures thrown around, but would love to hear if you have a view.

### Expert
I don't have a number off the top of my head. I think that's pretty well like a commodity piece of information that's published in a lot of different journals and resources. I don't know that any number I would offer you is any better than what you have. It's pretty public and transparent.

### Client
Got it. I've spoken with a few different people about this topic and there's varying views on the level of automation versus manual workflows within the RCM industry today. We'd love to hear your view on what you think the automation levels are. We can think of it in terms of, 100% would be the RCM activities of a provider having all the available technology that they can adopt, and 0% would be doing everything manually through Excel or legacy disparate systems.

### Expert
Okay. This is going to be a definitional exercise here. My sense in the industry, healthcare providers tend to be late adopters of technology. If you think about how they would compare to the rest of other modern industries, they're going to be a little bit farther behind in their adoption, which I think, leaves good running room. The environment is really complex and so there's a lot of compliance requirement.

My sense is that if we're talking automation, like having good tools and systems, maybe 40%-50% of the...

## Discussion on Automation in Revenue Cycle Management

**Client:**
Got it. Do you think it is possible for the RCM industry to operate with minimal human intervention? Obviously not today, but if you think 15, 20 years out, if there is a provider who is open to adopting such technology, is that possible, or do you think this will always be a labor-intensive industry?

**Expert:**
I think there's a real incentive for payers to keep it labor-intensive, to create administrative burden on the part of providers, because there's a financial incentive for payers to avoid paying claims, frankly.

**Client:**
Manual is less efficient?

**Expert:**
Manual is less efficient. It means, as long as there's arbitrage in the efficiencies, the arbitrage I'm talking about is, the payer can be ever slightly more efficient at avoiding paying claims than a provider can be at resolving claims without human intervention, then that arbitrage results in financial benefit for the commercial payers.

In the context of the U.S. healthcare system, there's always an advantage to not pay claims. The deck is stacked on the side of payer organizations that have complex rules, rather than on hospitals who are trying to navigate all the complexity of these rules across multiple different payer categories, which is where companies like Waystar or Availity come into play. They're better at keeping their finger on the pulse of what the payer policies are, and what the government policies are, so the hospitals themselves don't have to figure that out individually. That's the value that they provide.

**Client:**
That's helpful context. Would you have a sense of what percent of automation adoption is already there in the industry?

**Expert:**
I think the automation adoption is actually pretty low. It's 15% or 20%. I don't have a statistical study to point to, so this is a value-based judgment call. I would definitely say it's on that lower-end, that automation.

**Client:**
Certainly. I've spoken to around 10 people now and most people do have the view that it's around 20-ish percent automated. There are some people who say, "In our system, it's 70% automated and we think the rest of U.S. is already 50%-60% automated, and there's not a lot of headroom." That's something I'm trying to wrap my head around. What is the truth here, and what can cause people to be more biased one way or the other?

**Expert:**
I think the question that you'd ask in that circumstance where somebody says there's not a lot of headroom and it's already very automated is, what's the cost-to-collect and how many people does the revenue cycle function employ? If the cost-to-collect is about 4%-5%, then there's not a lot of automation happening. If it's 4%-3%, then there's more automation happening. You can use those rough cost-to-collect figures.

**Client**
Understood. One way to do this could be to just look at, I'm sure these figures would be easily available, to just look at, U.S. provider revenue and then what they spend on RCM, and then the overall percentage can give us a sense of automation here.

**Expert**
That will be a little bit different in the type of hospitals you'll want to segment. Separating academic medical centers, from integrated delivery networks, from education-based organizations versus hospitals of last resort. In economically-challenged areas with high Medicare and Medicaid percentages, those figures are all just going to be a little different because compensation is different as a market basket-of-services.

**Client**
That's a good point. Let's talk more about this 15%-20%. This is, as you said, based on your perception of the industry. Could you tell me more about what your sample size is, what kind of providers you've observed? What do you mean here when you say 100%? Is it full adoption of the available technology today or is it end-to-end adoption and having a minimal human?

**Expert**
I'll start with the end in mind here for a second. My vision for an automated revenue cycle would be automatic adjudication of claims, so that when a hospital submits a claim to a payer, it's adjudicated upon receipt and either denied, or adjusted, or paid at the moment. That is my definition of what good looks like. I've already mentioned why I don't think that there's an incentive for payers to do that because they're going to have to release cash so much more quickly.

They're going to have a negative impact on their financials because they kept cash 60-90 days more, and it really adjusts the way that they can report in quarterly earnings. That's my definition of good. Now, anything between where we are today and there, it's really just finding ways to more efficiently automate functions that people once did.

There are reports of machine learning, and AI more recently, in hospital revenue cycle, which is great. There's some real challenges though. That's a big way of automation, of having training data sets and having computers make decisions that people don't have to.

When I talk about those, the challenges with third-party vendors, and for example, Waystar is one example of a third-party vendor like that, the training data sets are limited by their ability to collect the data. We implemented, many years ago, an autonomous coding solution. It was specifically intended to do autonomous coding for the emergency room visit population. It was targeted in that zone, and we needed to provide some million claims and all the supporting documentation to create a training data set that would allow a certain percentage of the claims to be autonomously coded.

It can take a year to extract that kind of data and transfer it over. When you think about who has the advantage in the market, I think it's really in a position where those organizations, like the EHR providers like Epic, who have a lot of market share and own 100% of the data, they have the tools at their disposal to do better at these automation activities than third party vendors do over the long term.

**Client**
That was my sense as well when I started researching this industry from people I've spoken with. A lot of them mentioned that despite this, Epic and Cerner, they're still like a decade behind technology versus pure play providers like Waystar or Availity.

**Expert**
There's the capability technologically, but there's also the social aspect of how hospitals work. It's a lot of work to switch vendors or providers, or to implement a third-party solution to solve a problem. In the hospital

# Expert Insights on Healthcare Technology Adoption

## Expert Commentary
I would look at the market a little bit in terms of integrated delivery networks and hospital systems separate from physician practices and groups. There's more headroom with physician groups and the challenge there is that they're smaller. An implementation of a piece of technology, or adoption of technology has to be done in more units because there are smaller physician practices and physician groups.

The benefit from each of those installations in the adoption is constrained to the size of that operating unit where hospitals have more scale, for example. Secondarily, an important difference here is that in the physician space, the volume of claims relative to the number of dollars, the ratio is very different.

I want to say that in the physician space, it's almost 10 is to one ratio to the number of claims. The volume of work that needs to get processed, it's a lot higher with the physician market than it is with the hospital services. It's even less automated. When you think about that market specifically, it's a heavy lift. There's a lot of work to get that market and to bring those providers on. They're less likely to be on Epic because they can't afford that investment in time or money to do those implementations. The need is higher because the volume of claims is so significantly bigger.

## Client Inquiry
I see. You think spending on technology is 16%-20% today versus what could be at full automation, but when it comes to available technology, everyone's using pretty much something or the other. Do you have a sense of what percent adoption is of legacy systems or disparate systems, or things that aren't really best in class versus level of adoption for the best solutions in the market, like Waystar, for example?

## Expert Response
My perspective is a little bit biased towards my experience, which is in larger healthcare systems and organizations that manage revenue cycle on behalf of hospitals. I have a little bit of difficulty leaning into a definitive answer there. Can we break that apart, maybe, let's look at a smaller piece and see if we can come to some answers?

## Client Follow-Up
Yeah. The major question is the headroom for providers like Waystar and Availity, do you have any views on those?

## Expert Analysis
Yeah. If we think about Availity and Waystar as a class of providers, they have some fundamental differences. Availity's fundamental difference is that it functions with maybe two fundamental differences as I understand them. One is that, it has more of the data-interchange capabilities, so data-clearinghouse, and they provide more of those services to facilities, so it's a commoditized, low unit-value activity, but it's actually something that is fairly protected, as industry changes, because it's not such a value-add activity that someone like Epic is going to invest money and time into doing that.

They also work with the payer and the provider market, and that increases the headroom, as you mentioned, because they have relationships in both of those different markets, whereas Waystar tends to work more specifically with providers. What they're doing really is establishing a lot of different components of service. They talk about it being a platform that's interconnected.

My experience in the industry is that companies like Waystar have grown through acquisition, and integrating those acquisitions is really hard, and integrating the data between different platforms is really hard. I'm suspicious whenever I hear the end-to-end terminology in marketing. I suspect that they're a lot less connected than maybe the public, or the outwardly-facing marketing material would suggest.

## Client Question
Got it. How do you think about the competitive tension between fully outsourced service providers like R1 versus tech vendors like Waystar and Availity?

# Expert Discussion on Revenue Cycle Management

## Expert Insights

I think fully outsourced vendors will strategically use capabilities from these third-party vendors, but they're on a path to produce their own capabilities unless it's a commoditized service like Availity's claims clearinghouses. Those are the kinds of things that they won't necessarily do, but all the value add-stuff, a lot of what Waystar is doing, for example, is just exactly what an organization who is managing revenue cycle for a hospital would want to provide themselves so that they can keep the margin in-house.

Often, these contracts are founded or structured across cost-to-collect. If I can come into a hospital and provide better service at a lower cost, I keep the float, is how a lot of these contracts are structured, which is a really good justification for these third-party revenue cycle management firms to develop all these capabilities internally rather than have to go out to the market and pay margin plus preference price to Waystar to provide those functions.

## Client Inquiry

**Client:** Who do you think is going to be the winner in this between these two? Services has become a bigger portion of the market, then naturally, they try to develop those solutions as much as they can in-house, or do you think hospitals would rather try to keep more and more of these functions in-house and just automate it with technology instead?

## Expert Response

**Expert:** No. It's happened a lot, but I think on a continuing basis, hospitals will see real incentives and value in outsourcing the revenue cycle function to third parties. It has to do a little bit with economics and demographics and locations. In the U.S., you've got hospitals that are interspersed all across the country. There are some large integrated delivery networks, there are some commercial, or full-profit healthcare systems.

Generally, hospitals are in the communities that they serve, and regionally focused, and having talent and being able to run a modern and efficient revenue cycle, it's just hard in the context where you're working in a small town or in a less advanced region where it's harder to recruit talent and harder to keep talent, when talent is likely to go to consulting firms and go to the cities, and think about that, the migration of talent.

One of the ways that hospitals can address the cost-to-collect and that burden, and they can also simplify their financial statement by more accurately predicting their revenue cycle performance, is to outsource to a firm to manage it for them. We can bring more scale and you can bring more talent and resources that hospitals couldn't necessarily do because they're having to make the capital allocation decisions relative to providing clinical care facilities, employment as well as revenue cycle.

In the hospital context, that's a lot harder to do. Just like competing for the dollars and cents and the time is a lot harder in a healthcare system than it is if you are doing that within the revenue cycle function independently where you can make plays on certain things.

## Client Follow-Up

**Client:** Understood. You think generally, outsourcing is the more superior model that's taking share?

## Expert Confirmation

**Expert:** I think financially, it is the more superior model. Yeah. Less risk and more dependability.

## Client Inquiry on Cost

**Client:** What is the cost-to-collect generally when it comes to these fully outsourced models?

## Expert Data

**Expert:** 3.5%-4%.

**Client:** I see. Do you have a sense of best-in-class cost-to-collect if it's in-house and fully automated?

# Expert-Client Discussion Transcript

## Expert
I think it's getting 2.5%-3%.

## Client
Got it. From a cost perspective, maybe it's better to keep things in-house but fully automate them.

## Expert
It could be if you have the right provider. I just think that the institutional barriers to doing that are really high. A CIO, or CFO, or head of revenue cycle, whatever the person is, making these decisions at the hospital, needs to be able to build a full suite of services. They're not necessarily just going to Waystar and saying, "I'll buy everything."

Each of the departments in a revenue cycle in the healthcare delivery context is going to be split up with different leaders, and each of those individuals is going to have preferences. One of the benefits of going to an outsource provider is to say, "You guys just manage it for us and make a majority of the decisions."

The alternative is, the CFO is working with directors and VPs of different subfunctions, doing a lot of hunting and pecking trying to find the right solutions and then trying to line up the implementation resources to do that work. It's just a lot of balls to keep in the air. From a social perspective, it's actually pretty unlikely that individual providers are going to be operating in a context where they've got a full set of fully-implemented best-of-breed solutions. I just find that to be a bridge that's maybe too far.

## Client
I see. In terms of the tech providers themselves, do you have a sense of who the best ones are?

## Expert
The tech providers specifically?

## Client
Yeah. Waystar, Availity, Experian, TriZetto, or maybe the EHR guys.

## Expert
I don't have firsthand experience with all of them, I think it's a little hard for me to say. My advice would be to go to the KLAS reports. Are you familiar with KLAS?

## Client
Yeah. I have seen some reports from them.

## Expert
I think KLAS will do a good job. There is the hospital black books as well. Their business is going out and doing interviews and understanding the market in terms of customer satisfaction and quality. My sense is that they're going to have a very good view, or at least better data than I could give you, which would be completely anecdotal, which is, for some of the solutions that I have seen used, Waystar is well regarded.

## Client
Understood. Are there any other smarter ways to think about the headroom here for automation for these companies?

## Expert
There are a ton of emerging companies in the industry, and they are often built around small niche problems that they're trying to solve. They're using AI. There are a lot of the energies around AI right now, using to solve a very, very specific problem. I suspect that the business model around some of these is to develop a capability that's strong enough that one of the aggregators like Availity or Waystar will buy them.

# Document Content

I remember Intermountain has a venture capital sub-function or arm, and they would invest in technologies, use the Intermountain Health and delivery network as a proving ground, and then sell those companies off to larger providers. There's just a lot of churn and a lot of activity in the market.

I think if there's headroom identifying some of those organizations who have a novel way to solve a problem, and it really depends on the depth of their revenue cycle experience, which suggests that they will be able to solve that problem with the tools. Those companies will probably get pretty good multiples if they're actually able to be sold to companies.

## Client
Zooming out, wouldn't a simpler question just be, what is the headroom for all of these together in terms of automation? How much legacy-tech is there, how much is still done manually, how much can we become automated with AI and machine learning in the near future?

## Expert
There's a big opportunity to continue to automate functions. Clearly, if there are still human bodies working in revenue cycle organizations, and shared service centers still employ thousands of people in India to do manual work, that is indicative of the fact that there's an opportunity. A lot of these solutions don't necessarily talk about fully automating a lot of what Waystar solutions have. They describe making better decisions or empowering humans to do better work or predict problems.

They're not necessarily automating the work, and the automation that's happening with the broader process automation is automating clicks that a human might typically make. You've got to line up the style of headroom. Is it automating manual activities, or is it avoiding manual activities with automation that integrates with payers? I think that's really the interesting place.

## Client
Got it. I really appreciate your help. Enjoy the rest of your day.
