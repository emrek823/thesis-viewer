## Slide 2: MARKET OUTLOOK

### MARKET OUTLOOK

*   Total US Healthcare spend on RCM is estimated to be ~$81B (2022) and expected to grow ~+4% p.a through 2026, in line with growth in overall Healthcare spend. The RCM outsourcing market (~$21B) is expected to continue growing at 8-10%. A bottoms up analysis of health system outsourcing tendencies suggests E2E outsourcing to be ~$6B and growing at ~8-10% p.a through 2027. The point solutions market will also continue to demonstrate steady growth, as it serves provider archetypes who are unwilling or unable to fully outsource

*   E2E vendors currently manage ~$145-175B in NPSR (~15 20% of the estimated total health system NPSR) and are expected to grow by ~$65-80B over the next 5 years (to ~25% of estimated total NPSR). New outsourced NPSR of ~$14B is expected to be 'up for grabs' annually and was determined using a bottoms up analysis of currently insourced health systems and their likelihood to outsource in the next 5 years

*   E2E RCM outsourcing will likely continue to see disproportionate growth within mid-sized systems (~$14B) specifically where financial headwinds (e.g., lower margins, high AR days) combine with strategic priorities and leadership/ownership changes. However, there remain several archetypes of health systems who prefer a point solution augmentation strategy some examples being well-performing health systems who value ownership and control of RCM operations, re-insourcers of failed E2E contracts, small health systems with insufficient scale for large E2E vendors (<$250M in NPSR), AMCs with complex labor situations, large nationals looking to commercialize their RCM function.

## Slide 5: GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: CLAIMS AND DENIAL MANAGEMENT

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: CLAIMS AND DENIAL MANAGEMENT

*   According to a 2017 report published by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the average claim denial rate across the US healthcare industry ranges between 5-10%
*   From the providers' perspective of the market, a lower claim denial rate is favorable. Healthcare providers can maximize claim reimbursement revenue only if the claim denial rates are low
*   However, keeping claim denial rates closer to the lower end of the industry average is not always easy, when providers engage with several payers at once
*   According to the 2017 American Medical Association's (AMA) national health insurer report, most major private payers kept their claim line denial rates under the 5% marker
*   In 2017, in the United States, Anthem had the highest claim line denials, with 2.64% of claim lines, followed by Humana, with 1.97%, Aetna, with 1.5%, and Cigna, with 0.54%
*   In the current market scenario, there is a lack of standardization, due to which, healthcare providers find it difficult to decipher payer language when it comes to claim denials. This is a major hindrance to the growth of claims and denial management
*   Overall, in the current market, claims and denial management draws data from across the healthcare organization. However, they must also manage different payer rules and codes. Using manual processes leads to decline in productivity, given the plethora of data needed to successfully manage denials
*   Therefore, the market for claims and denial management is expected to register modest growth, over the forecast period. The growth is likely to be majorly propelled by the surging demand to maximize claim reimbursement. However, at the same time, the growth may be limited due to lack of interoperability and standardization in claims data

## Slide 6: GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: MEDICAL CODING AND BILLING

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: MEDICAL CODING AND BILLING

*   A medical coder must be familiar with a number of sets and subsets of code. This makes medical coding a tiresome and human-oriented process
*   Globally, two sets are widely adopted in medical coding. These include the International Classification of Diseases (ICD codes) and Current Procedure Terminology (CPT codes). These code standards for medical coding act as universal language between doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, insurance clearinghouses, government agencies, and other health-specific organizations
*   The most crucial process in medical coding involves reading healthcare provider's report. The medical coder reads the healthcare provider's report of the patient's visit, and then translates each bit of information into a code. From this point onward, the medical code is fed into a system or software platform from where it can be processed for medical billing.
*   The medical biller acts as a bridge between patients, healthcare providers, and insurance companies
*   Both medical coding and billing are manual activities with very little scope for automation. Additionally, the professionals required as medical coders and billers need sophisticated medical training for dispensing these services. This cost-implication discourages potential healthcare professional to take on roles of medical coders and billers
*   The role of medical coding and billing in revenue management is indispensable, a very nominal growth in this functional area is expected, due to the limitation associated with medial coding (primarily that of extensive standardization)
*   Other factor, which is expected to limit market growth in this functional area, is the inability of medical billers to resolve delinquent payments for healthcare providers, which leads to lower revenue generation for the revenue cycle management market

## Slide 7: GLOBAL RCM MARKET – BY FUNCTION: ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET – BY FUNCTION: ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS

*   The adoption of electronic health records has increased dramatically among healthcare providers, in the past decade
*   With most providers using an EHR system, healthcare organizations are starting to turn to the process of modernizing their revenue cycle technology, in an effort to support value-based care
*   While healthcare revenue cycle management and EHR adoption are significantly different undertakings, an organization's EHR vendor selection may still be an important factor in the revenue cycle management vendor decision-making process
*   According to a 2016 KLAS survey, 59% of provider organizations considering a revenue cycle management system replacement stated that the reason behind their decision was to have more EHR and revenue cycle management integration
*   From the healthcare providers' perspective, the use of health IT tools cost approximately $32,000 per physician per year, in the United States (as of 2018, extrapolated from a 2016 value for the same index). This cost barrier discourages many healthcare providers from adopting healthcare revenue cycle management solutions, which do not integrate with existing EHR systems
*   Additionally, variations between separate EHR and healthcare revenue cycle management systems may jeopardize clinical and financial success. As payers adopt value-based purchasing, provider revenue depends on integrating clinical and financial data to improve care quality while reducing costs
*   Therefore, the growth of EHR functional area in the RCM market is expected to be modest, over the forecast period

## Slide 8: GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: CDI

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: CDI

*   Clinical documentation improvement (CDI) is the process of improving medical data collection to maximize claims reimbursement revenue and improve care quality
*   An effective revenue cycle relies on accurate and timely data. Clinical documentation improvement offers an opportunity to improve medial coding and maximize the reimbursement
*   Therefore in addition to revenue enhancements, CDI also advances the patient care. In this the care team members collaborate together and create the personalized treatment plans, when they have access to an more precise detailed patient record
*   Thus the provider the and organization performance on key quality measures may improve. For instance the Heritage Valley Health System in Pennsylvania, US reported a significant patient care improvement after implementing a CDI initiative. Therefore better documentation and coding reduced their predicted mortality rate by 27% and thus it shows a positive impact on the market
*   The top barrier to effectively implement a CDI strategy is the lack of understanding among staff and clinicians regarding strong documentation practices
*   One of the largest CDI vendors in North America is 3M Health Information. Other high ranking vendors in the region include Optum360, Navicure, FastChart, and StreamLine
*   The market for CDI application is expected to increase drastically over the forecast period, due to increasing uptrend in value-based patient care. However, the major restraint to the growth of this market segment is lack of skilled personnel, a situation that is expected to improve over the forecast period, due to increasing stress on ICD-10 certification-based training

## Slide 9: GLOBAL RCM MARKET – BY FUNCTION: INSURANCE

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET – BY FUNCTION: INSURANCE

*   Communicating with health insurance companies is a key component of revenue cycle management (RCM)
*   When an appointment is scheduled by the patient, the physician's office or the hospital staff typically checks the patient's reported insurance coverage before the visit.
*   After an insured patient receives treatment for a given condition and supplies any applicable co-payment, a healthcare provider or medical coder categorizes the nature of the treatment according to ICD-10 codes
*   The hospital or care facility then sends the care summary, with ICD and Current Procedural Technology codes, to the patient's insurance company, to see what portion of care may be covered by insurance, and the patient is billed for the remainder
*   Additionally, RCM systems can also save healthcare providers' money by giving them insight into the reason behind denied claims. Specifically, an RCM system can cut down on denied claims, by prompting healthcare employees to enter all the information required for claims processing
*   This saves them from having to revise or resubmit the claim, and gives providers better insight into why certain claims have been denied, thereby enabling them to rectify the issue. This also ensures that the providers are reimbursed properly, for taking care of insured patients
*   Overall, the application of RCM for medical insurance disbursement is expected to increase over the forecast period, due to increasing demand for value-based healthcare, which, in turn, is due to increasing demand for reducing healthcare costs. These factors may contribute to the growth of the insurance application of the RCM market

## Slide 10: GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: OTHER FUNCTIONS

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: OTHER FUNCTIONS

*   Other functional areas in revenue cycle management include patient pre-authorization, eligibility and benefits verification, and medical reporting
*   The US government defines pre-authorization as a decisive step by a health insurer or plan that a prescription medication, procedure, service, or equipment is medically necessary. The exception to pre-authorization arises in cases of medical emergency
*   The pre-authorization forms the initial steps or the first step in revenue cycle management. An increasing number of healthcare providers are seeking RCM solutions either in-house or through third-party services, to improve the pre-authorization process
*   Similarly, the RCM solutions are being deployed by healthcare providers to determine the eligibility of patients, as well as for the determination of benefits verification
*   Modern medical office software includes automatic checking of patient eligibility via the internet, over secure channels, meaning that using dedicated RCM software can speed up the work involved in verifying whether a patient is entitled to a particular benefit
*   Lastly, medical reporting involves the usage of global medical standards (like ICD-10), which have limitations of human error. RCMs improve the medical reporting by eliminating human errors
*   Overall, the other functions segment of the RCM market is expected to register high growth over the forecast period, primarily due to increasing demand for value-based reimbursement

*   The total spend on RCM activities (i.e., RCM outsourced and insourced) is at ~$79B, growing at ~4% p.a.
*   Primarily driven by continued healthcare spend growth in acute and non-acute care settings
*   While there was a deceleration due to COVID-19, healthcare and RCM spend has largely recovered over the past year
*   The outsourced RCM market is increasing at an est. 8-10% p.a;
    *   Growth has been driven by increased regulations and complexity in RCM best managed through E2E or point solution strategies
    *   Labor shortages have led many providers to consider outsourcing RCM functions with deals ramping up during 2020-2021

E2E activity has increased in recent years however its continued growth over the longer term remains uncertain

**Recent growth drivers**
*   Decreased financial performance in acute settings: Average operating margin shrinking by ~40% among large hospital1 and 50-60% in mid size hospitals1 from 2018-2020
*   Increased needs given hospital constraints with staffing and labor shortages
*   Rise in claims backlogs and returning patient volumes to pre-Covid levels

**Limitations to growth**
*   Growth is dependent on small customer pool and relatively depleted pipelines which could lead to high variability in the next 5 years

## Slide 22: OUTSOURCED E2E MARKET GROWTH TRENDS

### OUTSOURCED E2E MARKET GROWTH TRENDS

E2E OUTSOURCING MARKET IS EXPECTED TO GROW 8-10% OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS WITH OUTSIZED GROWTH COMING FROM THE MEDIUM AND SMALL SIZED HEALTH SYSTEMS

#### KEY TAKEAWAYS

*   The NPR outsourced to E2E vendors is increasing at 8-10% p.a in 2021-27
*   Growth has been driven by increased regulations and complexity in RCM - best managed through E2E or point solution strategies
*   Labor shortages, and margin pressures have led many providers to consider outsourcing RCM functions with deals ramping up during 2020-2021
*   The acceleration of growth could also be COVID driven, but is not thought to be transient
    *   Backlog of deals not sold or implemented during COVID coming to market
    *   Many of the structural forces pressuring providers were only exacerbated by COVID

#### TOTAL OUTSOURCED NPSR GROWTH, $BN

**Overall Growth:** 8-10% p.a (2021-2027)
**Organic Growth in Outsourced NPSR:** ~5% p.a (2016-2027)

*   Outsourced NPSR penetration is expected to increase for all three size segments over the next 5-6 years, with the largest increase in penetration coming from small health systems (6% penetration in 2021 to 23% penetration in 2021) and medium health systems (9% penetration in 2021 to 22% penetration in 2021)
*   This increase in penetration is because smaller health systems may benefit more from improvement in staffing and RCM knowledge
*   While larger health systems also benefit from the value proposition of outsourcing to E2E vendors, a significant number of large health systems are 'never nevers' for outsourcing (e.g., large employer in state) or 'not in next 5 years' (e.g., unionized), thus limiting the possible penetration growth within this segment

**Delivery of RCM functionality requires both service based capabilities (billers, coders, schedulers, etc.) and tech enabled point solutions to augment delivery (patient payment systems, chargemaster scrubbers/audits, workflow prioritization tools)**

Source: Expert interviews
Notes:
1. Companies that are either (a) tech enabled services, or (b) services, and take on the work of identification/validation/recovery of dollars
2. Companies that provide a tech only solution and are likely paid as a license/ subscription fee

RCM MARKET AND THESIS
1
MARKET OUTLOOK
Total US Healthcare spend on RCM is estimated to be ~$81B (2022) and expected to grow ~+4% p.a through 2026, in line with growth in overall
Healthcare spend. The RCM outsourcing market (~$21B) is expected to continue growing at 8-10%. A bottoms up analysis of health system
outsourcing tendencies suggests E2E outsourcing to be ~$6B and growing at ~8-10% p.a through 2027. The point solutions market will also
continue to demonstrate steady growth, as it serves provider archetypes who are unwilling or unable to fully outsource
E2E vendors currently manage ~$145-175B in NPSR (~15 20% of the estimated total health system NPSR) and are expected to grow by ~$65-
80B over the next 5 years (to ~25% of estimated total NPSR). New outsourced NPSR of ~$14B is expected to be 'up for grabs' annually and was
determined using a bottoms up analysis of currently insourced health systems and their likelihood to outsource in the next 5 years
E2E RCM outsourcing will likely continue to see disproportionate growth within mid-sized systems (~$14B) specifically where financial
headwinds (e.g., lower margins, high AR days) combine with strategic priorities and leadership/ownership changes. However, there remain
several archetypes of health systems who prefer a point solution augmentation strategy some examples being well-performing health systems
who value ownership and control of RCM operations, re-insourcers of failed E2E contracts, small health systems with insufficient scale for large
E2E vendors (<$250M in NPSR), AMCs with complex labor situations, large nationals looking to commercialize their RCM function.

GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: CLAIMS AND DENIAL MANAGEMENT
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
According to a 2017 report published by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the
average claim denial rate across the US healthcare industry ranges between 5-10%
•
From the providers' perspective of the market, a lower claim denial rate is favorable.
Healthcare providers can maximize claim reimbursement revenue only if the claim denial
rates are low
However, keeping claim denial rates closer to the lower end of the industry average is not
always easy, when providers engage with several payers at once
According to the 2017 American Medical Association's (AMA) national health insurer
report, most major private payers kept their claim line denial rates under the 5% marker
In 2017, in the United States, Anthem had the highest claim line denials, with 2.64% of
claim lines, followed by Humana, with 1.97%, Aetna, with 1.5%, and Cigna, with 0.54%
In the current market scenario, there is a lack of standardization, due to which, healthcare
providers find it difficult to decipher payer language when it comes to claim denials. This is
a major hindrance to the growth of claims and denial management
Overall, in the current market, claims and denial management draws data from across the
healthcare organization. However, they must also manage different payer rules and
codes. Using manual processes leads to decline in productivity, given the plethora of data
needed to successfully manage denials
Therefore, the market for claims and denial management is expected to register modest
growth, over the forecast period. The growth is likely to be majorly propelled by the surging
demand to maximize claim reimbursement. However, at the same time, the growth may be
limited due to lack of interoperability and standardization in claims data

GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: MEDICAL CODING AND BILLING
•
•
•
A medical coder must be familiar with a number of sets and subsets of code. This makes
medical coding a tiresome and human-oriented process
•
Globally, two sets are widely adopted in medical coding. These include the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD codes) and Current Procedure Terminology (CPT codes).
These code standards for medical coding act as universal language between doctors,
hospitals, insurance companies, insurance clearinghouses, government agencies, and
other health-specific organizations
•
The most crucial process in medical coding involves reading healthcare provider's report.
The medical coder reads the healthcare provider's report of the patient's visit, and then
translates each bit of information into a code. From this point onward, the medical code is
•
fed into a system or software platform from where it can be processed for medical billing.
The medical biller acts as a bridge between patients, healthcare providers, and insurance
companies
•
Both medical coding and billing are manual activities with very little scope for automation.
Additionally, the professionals required as medical coders and billers need sophisticated
medical training for dispensing these services. This cost-implication discourages potential
healthcare professional to take roles of medical coders and billers
The role of medical coding and billing in revenue management is indispensable, a very
nominal growth in this functional area is expected, due to the limitation associated with
medial coding (primarily that of extensive standardization)
Other factor, which is expected to limit market growth in this functional area, is the inability
of medical billers to resolve delinquent payments for healthcare providers, which leads to
lower revenue generation for the revenue cycle management market

GLOBAL RCM MARKET – BY FUNCTION: ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The adoption of electronic health records has increased dramatically among healthcare
providers, in the past decade
With most providers using an EHR system, healthcare organizations are starting to turn to
the process of modernizing their revenue cycle technology, in an effort to support value-
based care
While healthcare revenue cycle management and EHR adoption are significantly different
undertakings, an organization's EHR vendor selection may still be an important factor in the
revenue cycle management vendor decision-making process
According to a 2016 KLAS survey, 59% of provider organizations considering a revenue
cycle management system replacement stated that the reason behind their decision was to
have more EHR and revenue cycle management integration
From the healthcare providers' perspective, the use of health IT tools cost approximately
$32,000 per physician per year, in the United States (as of 2018, extrapolated from a 2016
value for the same index). This cost barrier discourages many healthcare providers from
adopting healthcare revenue cycle management solutions, which do not integrate with
existing EHR systems
Additionally, variations between separate EHR and healthcare revenue cycle management
systems may jeopardize clinical and financial success. As payers adopt value-based
purchasing, provider revenue depends on integrating clinical and financial data to improve
care quality while reducing costs
Therefore, the growth of EHR functional area in the RCM market is expected to be modest,
over the forecast period

GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: CDI
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Clinical documentation improvement (CDI) is the process of improving medical data
collection to maximize claims reimbursement revenue and improve care quality
An effective revenue cycle relies on accurate and timely data. Clinical documentation
improvement offers an opportunity to improve medial coding and maximize the
reimbursement
Therefore in addition to revenue enhancements, CDI also advances the patient care. In
this the care team members collaborate together and create the personalized treatment
plans, when they have access to an more precise detailed patient record
Thus the provider the and organization performance on key quality measures may improve.
For instance the Heritage Valley Health System in Pennsylvania, US reported a significant
patient care improvement after implementing a CDI initiative. Therefore better
documentation and coding reduced their predicted mortality rate by 27% and thus it shows
a positive impact on the market
The top barrier to effectively implement a CDI strategy is the lack of understanding among
staff and clinicians regarding strong documentation practices
One of the largest CDI vendors in North America is 3M Health Information. Other high
ranking vendors in the region include Optum360, Navicure, FastChart, and StreamLine
The market for CDI application is expected to increase drastically over the forecast period,
due to increasing uptrend in value-based patient care. However, the major restraint to the
growth of this market segment is lack of skilled personnel, a situation that is expected to
improve over the forecast period, due to increasing stress on ICD-10 certification-
based training

GLOBAL RCM MARKET – BY FUNCTION: INSURANCE
•
•
•
•
•
Communicating with health insurance companies is a key component of revenue cycle
management (RCM)
•
When an appointment is scheduled by the patient, the physician's office or the hospital staff
typically checks the patient's reported insurance coverage before the visit.
After an insured patient receives treatment for a given condition and supplies any applicable
co-payment, a healthcare provider or medical coder categorizes the nature of the treatment
according to ICD-10 codes
•
The hospital or care facility then sends the care summary, with ICD and Current Procedural
Technology codes, to the patient's insurance company, to see what portion of care may be
covered by insurance, and the patient is billed for the remainder
Additionally, RCM systems can also save healthcare providers' money by giving them insight
into the reason behind denied claims. Specifically, an RCM system can cut down on denied
claims, by prompting healthcare employees to enter all the information required for claims
processing
This saves them from having to revise or resubmit the claim, and gives providers better
insight into why certain claims have been denied, thereby enabling them to rectify the issue.
This also ensures that the providers are reimbursed properly, for taking care of insured
patients
Overall, the application of RCM for medical insurance disbursement is expected to increase
over the forecast period, due to increasing demand for value-based healthcare, which, in
turn, is due to increasing demand for reducing healthcare costs. These factors may
contribute to the growth of the insurance application of the RCM market

GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: OTHER FUNCTIONS
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Other functional areas in revenue cycle management include patient pre-authorization,
eligibility and benefits verification, and medical reporting
The US government defines pre-authorization as a decisive step by a health insurer or
plan that a prescription medication, procedure, service, or equipment is medically
necessary. The exception to pre-authorization arises in cases of medical emergency
The pre-authorization forms the initial steps or the first step in revenue cycle management.
An increasing number of healthcare providers are seeking RCM solutions either in-house
or through third-party services, to improve the pre-authorization process
Similarly, the RCM solutions are being deployed by healthcare providers to determine the
eligibility of patients, as well as for the determination of benefits verification
Modern medical office software includes automatic checking of patient eligibility via the
internet, over secure channels, meaning that using dedicated RCM software can speed
up the work involved in verifying whether a patient is entitled to a particular benefit
Lastly, medical reporting involves the usage of global medical standards (like ICD-10),
which have limitations of human error. RCMs improve the medical reporting by eliminating
human errors
Overall, the other functions segment of the RCM market is expected to register high
growth over the forecast period, primarily due to increasing demand for value-

## Slide 5: GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: CLAIMS AND DENIAL MANAGEMENT

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: CLAIMS AND DENIAL MANAGEMENT

*   According to a 2017 report published by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the average claim denial rate across the US healthcare industry ranges between 5-10%
*   From the providers' perspective of the market, a lower claim denial rate is favorable. Healthcare providers can maximize claim reimbursement revenue only if the claim denial rates are low
*   However, keeping claim denial rates closer to the lower end of the industry average is not always easy, when providers engage with several payers at once
*   According to the 2017 American Medical Association's (AMA) national health insurer report, most major private payers kept their claim line denial rates under the 5% marker
*   In 2017, in the United States, Anthem had the highest claim line denials, with 2.64% of claim lines, followed by Humana, with 1.97%, Aetna, with 1.5%, and Cigna, with 0.54%
*   In the current market scenario, there is a lack of standardization, due to which, healthcare providers find it difficult to decipher payer language when it comes to claim denials. This is a major hindrance to the growth of claims and denial management
*   Overall, in the current market, claims and denial management draws data from across the healthcare organization. However, they must also manage different payer rules and codes. Using manual processes leads to decline in productivity, given the plethora of data needed to successfully manage denials
*   Therefore, the market for claims and denial management is expected to register modest growth, over the forecast period. The growth is likely to be majorly propelled by the surging demand to maximize claim reimbursement. However, at the same time, the growth may be limited due to lack of interoperability and standardization in claims data

## Slide 6: GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: MEDICAL CODING AND BILLING

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: MEDICAL CODING AND BILLING

*   A medical coder must be familiar with a number of sets and subsets of code. This makes medical coding a tiresome and human-oriented process
*   Globally, two sets are widely adopted in medical coding. These include the International Classification of Diseases (ICD codes) and Current Procedure Terminology (CPT codes). These code standards for medical coding act as universal language between doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, insurance clearinghouses, government agencies, and other health-specific organizations
*   The most crucial process in medical coding involves reading healthcare provider's report. The medical coder reads the healthcare provider's report of the patient's visit, and then translates each bit of information into a code. From this point onward, the medical code is fed into a system or software platform from where it can be processed for medical billing.
*   The medical biller acts as a bridge between patients, healthcare providers, and insurance companies
*   Both medical coding and billing are manual activities with very little scope for automation. Additionally, the professionals required as medical coders and billers need sophisticated medical training for dispensing these services. This cost-implication discourages potential healthcare professional to take on roles of medical coders and billers
*   The role of medical coding and billing in revenue management is indispensable, a very nominal growth in this functional area is expected, due to the limitation associated with medial coding (primarily that of extensive standardization)
*   Other factor, which is expected to limit market growth in this functional area, is the inability of medical billers to resolve delinquent payments for healthcare providers, which leads to lower revenue generation for the revenue cycle management market

## Slide 7: GLOBAL RCM MARKET – BY FUNCTION: ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET – BY FUNCTION: ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS

*   The adoption of electronic health records has increased dramatically among healthcare providers, in the past decade
*   With most providers using an EHR system, healthcare organizations are starting to turn to the process of modernizing their revenue cycle technology, in an effort to support value-based care
*   While healthcare revenue cycle management and EHR adoption are significantly different undertakings, an organization's EHR vendor selection may still be an important factor in the revenue cycle management vendor decision-making process
*   According to a 2016 KLAS survey, 59% of provider organizations considering a revenue cycle management system replacement stated that the reason behind their decision was to have more EHR and revenue cycle management integration
*   From the healthcare providers' perspective, the use of health IT tools cost approximately $32,000 per physician per year, in the United States (as of 2018, extrapolated from a 2016 value for the same index). This cost barrier discourages many healthcare providers from adopting healthcare revenue cycle management solutions, which do not integrate with existing EHR systems
*   Additionally, variations between separate EHR and healthcare revenue cycle management systems may jeopardize clinical and financial success. As payers adopt value-based purchasing, provider revenue depends on integrating clinical and financial data to improve care quality while reducing costs
*   Therefore, the growth of EHR functional area in the RCM market is expected to be modest, over the forecast period

## Slide 8: GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: CDI

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: CDI

*   Clinical documentation improvement (CDI) is the process of improving medical data collection to maximize claims reimbursement revenue and improve care quality
*   An effective revenue cycle relies on accurate and timely data. Clinical documentation improvement offers an opportunity to improve medial coding and maximize the reimbursement
*   Therefore in addition to revenue enhancements, CDI also advances the patient care. In this the care team members collaborate together and create the personalized treatment plans, when they have access to an more precise detailed patient record
*   Thus the provider the and organization performance on key quality measures may improve. For instance the Heritage Valley Health System in Pennsylvania, US reported a significant patient care improvement after implementing a CDI initiative. Therefore better documentation and coding reduced their predicted mortality rate by 27% and thus it shows a positive impact on the market
*   The top barrier to effectively implement a CDI strategy is the lack of understanding among staff and clinicians regarding strong documentation practices
*   One of the largest CDI vendors in North America is 3M Health Information. Other high ranking vendors in the region include Optum360, Navicure, FastChart, and StreamLine
*   The market for CDI application is expected to increase drastically over the forecast period, due to increasing uptrend in value-based patient care. However, the major restraint to the growth of this market segment is lack of skilled personnel, a situation that is expected to improve over the forecast period, due to increasing stress on ICD-10 certification-based training

## Slide 9: GLOBAL RCM MARKET – BY FUNCTION: INSURANCE

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET – BY FUNCTION: INSURANCE

*   Communicating with health insurance companies is a key component of revenue cycle management (RCM)
*   When an appointment is scheduled by the patient, the physician's office or the hospital staff typically checks the patient's reported insurance coverage before the visit.
*   After an insured patient receives treatment for a given condition and supplies any applicable co-payment, a healthcare provider or medical coder categorizes the nature of the treatment according to ICD-10 codes
*   The hospital or care facility then sends the care summary, with ICD and Current Procedural Technology codes, to the patient's insurance company, to see what portion of care may be covered by insurance, and the patient is billed for the remainder
*   Additionally, RCM systems can also save healthcare providers' money by giving them insight into the reason behind denied claims. Specifically, an RCM system can cut down on denied claims, by prompting healthcare employees to enter all the information required for claims processing
*   This saves them from having to revise or resubmit the claim, and gives providers better insight into why certain claims have been denied, thereby enabling them to rectify the issue. This also ensures that the providers are reimbursed properly, for taking care of insured patients
*   Overall, the application of RCM for medical insurance disbursement is expected to increase over the forecast period, due to increasing demand for value-based healthcare, which, in turn, is due to increasing demand for reducing healthcare costs. These factors may contribute to the growth of the insurance application of the RCM market

## Slide 10: GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: OTHER FUNCTIONS

### GLOBAL RCM MARKET - BY FUNCTION: OTHER FUNCTIONS

*   Other functional areas in revenue cycle management include patient pre-authorization, eligibility and benefits verification, and medical reporting
*   The US government defines pre-authorization as a decisive step by a health insurer or plan that a prescription medication, procedure, service, or equipment is medically necessary. The exception to pre-authorization arises in cases of medical emergency
*   The pre-authorization forms the initial steps or the first step in revenue cycle management. An increasing number of healthcare providers are seeking RCM solutions either in-house or through third-party services, to improve the pre-authorization process
*   Similarly, the RCM solutions are being deployed by healthcare providers to determine the eligibility of patients, as well as for the determination of benefits verification
*   Modern medical office software includes automatic checking of patient eligibility via the internet, over secure channels, meaning that using dedicated RCM software can speed up the work involved in verifying whether a patient is entitled to a particular benefit
*   Lastly, medical reporting involves the usage of global medical standards (like ICD-10), which have limitations of human error. RCMs improve the medical reporting by eliminating human errors
*   Overall, the other functions segment of the RCM market is expected to register high growth over the forecast period, primarily due to increasing demand for value-based reimbursement
