## Slide 3: Healthcare Payments Are Really Hard

Healthcare Payments Are Really Hard

**It's Hard For Practices To Get Paid**
*   Complex reimbursement
*   Administratively burdensome
*   Evolving payer policies and regulations

Ideal office visits prioritize patient care and immediate compensation.

**It's Hard For Payers to Pay**
*   Balancing cost containment with quality care provision
*   Complex billing and coding
*   Regulatory requirements

Consequently, some of these burdens are transferred to practices.
