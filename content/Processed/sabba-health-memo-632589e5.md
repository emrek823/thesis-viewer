# Sabba Health Memo

Updated: @January 17, 2023

## Insurance billing is broken.

*A simplified view of the complex insurance billing process.*

**Mission:** Make accepting insurance as easy as swiping a credit card.

The insurance billing process is insane. It is manual, highly complex, and the rules are always changing. Providers today are heavily reliant on outsourced medical billers to take on this complex insurance billing work. The reason is that working with insurance payers requires skilled, dedicated, and scaled resources.

These outsourced billers power a significant portion of reimbursements for providers and medical groups. Today, outsourced billing accounts for 1/3 of total spend on revenue cycle management, but it's the fastest growing segment, and expected to exceed in-house spending by 2030 at 12% CAGR.

The primary way billers have tried to make the process more effective and take on the increasing and dynamic demands of health insurance is to off-shore the labor load.

But the problem is that billers are still working through manual, mistake-prone, and slow processes creating limits to what they can do without dedicated technology. It can take 120+ days for your average provider to get paid and even longer when there are denials. This makes it practically impossible to operate a business. These problems result in $500B per year of billing and insurance-related administrative costs (12% of total US health expenditures).

> It should not be this hard or take this long for providers to get paid.

## Our Solution

What becomes clear is that the best way to disentangle this process is to start building better tooling for these medical billers.

Billers are uniquely situated in the process to have visibility into the problems, and 1-to-many access to providers and scaled claims data to allow us to automate this crazy process.

By leveraging automation to solve the hardest problems that billers face, we will unlock their ability to collect more reimbursements, faster, and cheaper for providers. Once we accomplish this, we will be able to disintermediate the payers in the billing process and shift power to providers via better infrastructure, tooling, and processes.

## Design Partners

> We are partnering with Medical Billing Company that processes $100MM+ in claims annually across multiple states and specialties, a billing team with decades of experience, and a CEO who shares our vision.

To start, we are partnering with this billing company to automate their claims and accounts receivables for the providers that they work with. In doing so, we help:
1. Reduce and prevent denials,
2. Leverage scale and ML to automate the manual and pattern matching work and create operational efficiencies, and
3. Make it easier and faster for their providers to get paid.

> **UPDATE:** As of December 2022, we have signed BAAs with 3 medical billing companies as design partners to help them automate their claims and accounts receivables. These billing companies process $100-$400MM+ in claims annually across states and specialties.

> **UPDATE:** As of January 2022, we've gotten access to design partners' historical claims data and have begun analysis to determine the denial types that our MVP product will focus on solving. The work currently is only documenting the existing manual workflows to resolve these denials of interest so that we can automate them.

## Long-Term Vision

> Our vision is to make it as easy for providers to get paid as it is for a pizza shop to get paid.

Accepting insurance payments should be as easy as accepting a credit card payment. We will use scale and build software to abstract away all the complexities across the revenue cycle management process. Solving the hardest problems for billers by automating claims and accounts receivables is just the beginning of untangling this problem.

Our ultimate objective is to abstract away insurance billing, entirely. Our goal is to continue to move through the insurance billing process step by step to automate it away entirely: authorizations, credentialing, collections, etc. We also believe that automation unlocks and expands the market from where it is today - for example, you can start reliably factoring invoices for providers, allowing instant payments - and that we're just scratching the surface on the long-term potential of what will be built.

We are on the first leg of realizing a future world where medical billing looks as simple as the image below because Sabba has abstracted the rest away.
