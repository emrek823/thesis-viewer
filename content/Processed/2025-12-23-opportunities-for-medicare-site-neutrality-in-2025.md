*The start of a new Congress and presidential* *administration means new opportunities to improve* *federal health programs such as Medicare. [Site neutrality](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/site-neutrality/)* *is a way to achieve significant savings for patients and* *taxpayers without cutting benefits.*

*Traditional [fee-for-service](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/fee-for-service/) Medicare pays health care* *providers using numerous different payment systems. As* *a result, it pays for medical services at different rates* *based on the settings in which they are delivered, even if* *there is no difference in the quality of the service or* *patients’ health care needs. For routine ambulatory* *services, Medicare on average pays hospitals twice the* *rate that that of physician practices and about 40* *percentage points more than that of ambulatory surgical* *centers (ASCs).[1](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink1 "Joe Albanese, “Reducing Overpayments in Medicare through Site Neutral Reforms,” Paragon Health Institute, June 7, 2023, ") This leads directly to higher costs for* *patients and more government spending. It also indirectly* *inflates health care costs by incentivizing hospitals to* *acquire independent physician practices, which they can* *re-structure as off-campus hospital outpatient* *departments (HOPDs) that are functionally identical to* *physician offices but receive hospital rates.*

*There have been numerous proposals to equalize* *payment rates across health care settings with site* *neutrality policies that could reduce federal spending* *and patient costs by up to hundreds of billions of dollars.[2](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink2 "Albanese, “Reducing Overpayments.”")* *The Trump administration previously recommended* *several such policies, and [site neutrality](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/site-neutrality/) is a bipartisan* *policy that Paragon and many other organizations have* *also supported.[3](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink3 "Paragon Health Institute, “Medicare Site-Neutral Payments: A Commonsense, Bipartisan Reform,” July 29, 2024, ") However, given hospitals’ opposition to* *[site neutrality](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/site-neutrality/)—and their economic, health, and political* *importance in many communities—it is possible that* *congressional action will be incremental. This brief* *recommends principles for site neutrality and evaluates* *several recent proposals.*

### Key Takeaways

* Medicare site-neutral payments would reduce wasteful spending, patient expenses, and health care consolidation by lowering Medicare’s payment rates for routine services provided in hospitals, which are higher than those of equivalent services in physician offices and ambulatory surgical centers.
* There are a variety of site neutrality proposals, some of which account for concerns such as the impact of payment reforms on rural hospitals.
* Lawmakers should design site neutrality policies that (1) eliminate existing differentials without creating new exemptions, (2) lower payment rates, (3) do not tolerate payment differentials or create excessively complex incentive structures in order to compensate rural hospitals, (4) do not undermine savings with excessive new Medicare spending, and (5) avoid government price controls in the private market.

### Principles for Site-Neutral Payment Policies

In general, Medicare should pay the same amount for the same services, even if delivered in different settings of care. Paying more for care that is better quality or that is for patients with greater needs may be understandable, but care setting alone is not a good proxy for these factors. Routine, low-acuity services that do not typically require hospital-level care have become a larger driver of outpatient hospital revenue over time.[4](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink4 "Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), “Aligning Fee-for-Service Payment Rates Across Ambulatory Settings,” in Report to the Congress: Medicare and the Health Care Delivery System, June 2023, ") In some cases, patients may be unaware that they are even receiving care in hospitals—as they may not know that their physician practices were acquired by hospital systems—or whether they are seeking care from urgent care facilities or emergency departments.[5](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink5 "Renuka Rayasam and Emily Siner, “It’s Called an Urgent Care Emergency Center—but Which Is It?,” NPR, June 20, 2024, ") It makes little sense to pay more than needed for hospital services, particularly because such spending accounts for about 60 percent of per capita health care costs in the United States, and per capita outpatient hospital spending in Medicare is projected to surge 155 percent between 2023 and 2034, compared to73 percent for Medicare benefits overall.[6](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink6 "Emma Wager et al., “What Drives Health Spending in the U.S. Compared to Other Countries?,” Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker, August 2, 2024, <a href=https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/what-drives-health-spending-in-the-u-s-compared-to-other-countries/ style=\"color:#00A6CF;\">https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/what-drives-health-spending-in-the-u-s-compared-to-other-countries/</a>; Brian Blase et al., “A Dozen Things to Know from CBO’s New Numbers,” Paragon Health Institute, June 26, 2024, <a href=https://paragoninstitute.org/private-health/a-dozen-things-to-know-from-cbos-new-numbers/ style=\"color:#00A6CF;\">https://paragoninstitute.org/private-health/a-dozen-things-to-know-from-cbos-new-numbers/</a>. ")

At the same time, lawmakers may be sensitive to the importance of hospital systems in their local communities and wish to mitigate the impact of policies that reduce their revenue. Critics of site neutrality have particularly highlighted financial challenges faced by rural hospitals—given their lower revenue and the lack of alternative providers in those communities—as a major objection to implementing such policies. However, these concerns do not justify maintaining an unfair, inefficient payment system that inflates the costs borne by those communities.

Site-neutral payment reform should align with certain principles. Table 1 applies these principles to each proposal discussed in this brief. It is worth noting that more far-reaching proposals may be desirable, but also may be more challenging to align with these principles.

![4MS Table 1 Site Neutrality 2025 A0wUU000002hyXdYAI 01](https://paragoninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/4MS_Table_1_site_neutrality_2025_a0wUU000002hyXdYAI-01.webp)

![6MS Table 2 Site Neutrality 2025 A0wUU000002hyXdYAI 01](https://paragoninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/6MS_Table_2_site_neutrality_2025_a0wUU000002hyXdYAI-01.webp)

These policy principles are:

1. Site neutrality should simplify payment policy by eliminating differentials and not create new exemptions, such as by carving out certain providers as exceptions to the policy.
2. Medicare should equalize payments by lowering, not raising, existing rates.
3. Policies to support rural providers should avoid unintended consequences. For example, policymakers should not tolerate harmful payment differentials, create excessively complex incentive structures, or expand existing distortionary policies, such as the many cost-based rural hospital payment methods (see Table 2).
4. Policymakers should not direct an excessive level of site neutrality savings to new Medicare spending given the program’s large fiscal challenges. It would be prudent to make new hospital spending temporary and subject to evaluation. Lawmakers should not assume that preserving hospital-centric models of care delivery is the best approach.
5. Site neutrality should apply to health programs where the government already sets payment rates, but it should not dictate rates in the private market. While site neutrality is a commonsense way to reduce costs to patients and taxpayers and to reduce distortions from government payment policy, policymakers should allow for flexibility of approaches in the private market. (For example, employers could insist on site-neutral payments in their health plans.) Enacting site neutrality should not preclude future improvements to the accuracy of health care prices that align them with the value of care.

### Site Neutrality Proposals

**1. Removing Exceptions to Past Site Neutrality Policies**Numerous proposals would build upon past site neutrality policies for off-campus HOPDs. In the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Congress established that Medicare payment for services delivered in such settings would be at the physician-office-equivalent rate. However, it exempted existing facilities and therefore does not apply to most of them.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) previously estimated that removing these exceptions would reduce Medicare spending by about $39 billion over 10 years.[7](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink7 "CBO, “Proposals Affecting Medicare—CBO’s Estimate of the President’s Fiscal Year 2021 Budget,” March 25, 2020, ") The Site-based Invoicing and Transparency Enhancement (SITE) Act would remove the exemptions for off-campus HOPDs but would maintain other exceptions for dedicated emergency departments while reducing their payment rates by 30 percent. It would also require an off-campus HOPD to report a unique health identifier separate from that of the parent hospital, making it easier for payers (both private insurers and government programs) to differentiate them for billing purposes.[8](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink8 "Site-based Invoicing and Transparency Enhancement Act, S. 1869, 118th Cong., ") Congress considered, but did not adopt, a policy requiring these separate identifiers at the end of 2024.[9](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink9 "Nick Hut, “Final bill ensures no loss of funding for Medicaid DSH payments, graduate medical education,” Healthcare Financial Management Association, December 21, 2024, ")

Other bills—such as the Health Care Fairness for All Act, which included other non-site neutrality policies, and the Prevent Hospital Overbilling of Medicare Act—would also remove exceptions to off-campus site neutrality and require unique identifiers for these facilities, except these bills would also remove exceptions for emergency departments and clarify the Health and Human Services Secretary’s authority to promote site-neutral payments administratively.[10](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink10 "Health Care Fairness for All Act, H.R. 3129, 118th Cong., <a href=https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3129/ style=\"color:#00A6CF;\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3129/</a>; Prevent Hospital Overbilling of Medicare Act, H.R. 2863, 118th Cong., <a href=https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2863 style=\"color:#00A6CF;\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2863</a>. For other proposals, including those related to unique identifiers and reporting of facility ownership, see Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, “Site-Neutral Legislative Proposals Gaining Traction,” July 27, 2023, <a href=https://www.crfb.org/blogs/site-neutral-legislative-proposals-gaining-traction style=\"color:#00A6CF;\">https://www.crfb.org/blogs/site-neutral-legislative-proposals-gaining-traction</a>. ") The latter bill would also apply requirements for health identifiers to claims from private payers.

The benefit of these proposals is that they build on existing policy by removing significant exceptions to site neutrality and requiring identification of the site of service, which ensures more accurate payments. Including emergency department services in these policies helps to increase health care savings and remove future opportunities for hospitals to unnecessarily direct patients to such departments to maximize their future revenue, although it could also reduce their compensation when there are genuinely higher costs due to greater patient acuity.

**2. Equalizing Rates for Specific Services**Another set of proposals would equalize payment rates for specific services and settings. The most prominent is the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act, which passed the House of Representatives at the end of 2023. Besides other health care provisions, the bill would [pay for](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/pay-for/) outpatient drug administration services delivered in excepted off-campus HOPDs at physician rates (with a one-year delay in rural areas) and require unique identifiers for off-campus HOPDs.[11](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink11 "Lower Costs, More Transparency Act, H.R. 5378, 118th Cong., ") CBO estimated it would save $3.7 billion over 10 years. [12](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink12 "CBO, “Estimated Direct Spending and Revenue Effects of H.R. 5378, the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act,” December 8, 2023, ")

Another bill, the Medicare Patient Access to Cancer Treatment Act would establish site-neutral rates for cancer care services across outpatient settings.[13](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink13 "Medicare Patient Access to Cancer Treatment Act, H.R. 4473, 118th Cong., ")

Finally, a proposal by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission ([MedPAC](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/medpac/)) in its June 2023 report to Congress would set payment rates for ambulatory services based on the settings of care where they are most performed, with some exceptions for services that have significant differences in bundled payments across settings.[14](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink14 "MedPAC, Medicare and the Health Care Delivery System, June 2023, ") This system would be designed to lower spending, so services mostly performed in physician offices would be paid at the lower physician rate regardless of their settings, while those mostly performed in hospitals would remain at the outpatient hospital rate when delivered in the hospital setting and at the
