### Background & Experience

- Previously at Apple health team working on medical records sharing feature
- Worked on patient medical record access from participating institutions
- Feature had low utilization despite release
- Noted challenge with Personal Health Record (PHR) monetization
- Moved to Levels (continuous glucose monitoring for metabolic dysfunction)
- Conducted extensive CGM testing and experimentation over 2+ years

### Current Focus Areas

- Exploring clinical data access and chart retrieval/release of information
- Identified gap in chart retrieval space with very low NPS scores
- Examining opportunities in provider workflows and network building
- Looking at data monetization opportunities with pharma partners
- Investigating provider incentive models for data sharing

### Market Observations & Opportunities

- Evolution of pharma data needs:
	- Started with IQVIA claims data (market share analysis)
	- Moving to linked data (Datavant, Komodo)
	- Now requiring detailed clinical records for rare disease/specialty pharmacy
- Provider payment opportunities:
	- AWV incentive payments ($200-250 from United)
	- Potential to double PCP compensation through risk-adjusted dollars
	- Opportunity for faster payout of risk-adjusted payments (30-60 days vs 12-18 months)

### Industry Connections & Developments

- Connected to Autonomy (neurology MSO)
- Familiar with Health Data Atlas and Michael Stratton’s work
- Discussion of Datavant’s position and TEFCA implications
- Noted challenges with Truveta’s health system data sharing model

### Next Steps

- Follow up meeting planned for next week or following week
- Meeting scheduled with Natalie and Rue from Autonomy on Wednesday morning
- Potential for collaboration on data access/consulting projects
- Further discussion planned around record retrieval opportunities
