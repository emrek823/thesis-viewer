## Slide 3: Meet Daniel

### Meet Daniel

### Background
*   **What was the family looking for?** This family engaged with ANNA on Daniel's 4th birthday to find diagnostic services
*   **How did they find ANNA?** Google search
*   **Other notes:** Their preferred language is Portuguese; insurance is MassHealth via Tufts

### The journey at ANNA
*   Our outreach team completed an intake with Daniel's mother on September 18th and he completed his diagnostic evaluation with ANNA just 3 weeks later on October 9th
*   After his diagnostic evaluation, Daniel was assessed for clinic-based ABA services the second week of January and started services in our Sudbury clinic the end of February
*   Daniel and his family have been an active full-day client in Matt's pod in our Sudbury clinic. He loves the planets and has been sharing this interest and more with his ANNA clinical team

### ANNA's impact
*   Daniel has made progress reducing his challenging behaviors (aggression, biting, tantrums) and increasing his functional communication (verba). He has built strong relationships with peers and the ANNA team
*   Recently, Daniel's mom shared on an Instagram story about the progress she has seen him make and made a special shout out to ANNA (completely unsolicited). This even sparked an inbound referral from a family in the community

“At ANNA Autism Care, I found
all the care, love, and affection
that my child needs. Leaving
him there gives me the
assurance that he develops
more and more every day. The
team is amazing and attentive,
always willing to help. I highly
recommend it to any mother
who wants her child to be in a
safe and loving environment!”

## Slide 4: Highlights from Q2 2025

### Highlights from Q2 2025
*   **Strong Referral Growth:** $4.96 million ARR at assessment (July '25), up from $1.65mm in Q4 2024
*   **Real Estate Expansion:** 2 locations targeting early Q4 go-live; 2 other leases in active negotiation with expected go-live dates in early Q1 2025
*   **Team Expansion:** Secured key leadership hires in HR (Director of People Ops, Director of TA) and Technology (Founding Engineer); Ramping clinical hiring (August BT class largest ever at 10) and implementing ATS (Ashby) to increase hiring efficiency and efficacy
*   **Prior Authorization Timeline Solve:** Concurrent assessment authorization submission with assessment completion and intervention authorization submission with intervention start --> 3-months to 1-month timeline
*   **AI Roadmap:** Hired strong founding engineer and design agency and created AI clinical roadmap + beginning development
*   **BCBA Billing:** 54% gross margin from Sudbury BCBAs, creating pathway for strong margin

## Slide 5: Challenges from Q2 2025

HIGHLIGHTS, CHALLENGES, AND COMPANY NEEDS

### Challenges from Q2 2025
*   **Prior Authorization Timelines:** Previously struggled with extensive prior authorization timelines, leading to increased ARR but not realizing revenue
    *   **Mitigant:** Developed new SOP for accelerating into services
*   **Market Expansion:** Medicaid contracting timelines extensive, and commercial contracting gated by Medicaid slowing down market entry
    *   **Mitigant:** Evaluating strategic M&A, engaging lobbyists in top states, and expanding states of contracting
*   **Unit-Level Initial Client Ramp:** Slower than expected ramp in Wayland due to PA issue and seasonality
    *   **Mitigant:** Low-hanging fruit in marketing, building Community Outreach and Engagement team (added two new members to this team in August in preparation for growth)
*   **BT Retention:** Strong recruiting numbers but early indications of attrition challenges
    *   **Mitigant:** Reimagining the BT role and compensation to improve retention

## Slide 6: Company Needs

HIGHLIGHTS, CHALLENGES, and COMPANY NEEDS

### Company Needs
*   **Payor Development:** Looking for a consultant to help us navigate payor negotiations and relationship building, ideally previous payor executive with deep knowledge and network
*   **SEM:** Looking to speak with any Search Engine Marketing experts—not a major channel for us but worth evaluating

## Slide 17: Initial Outcomes Review

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Initial Outcomes Review

#### Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale Scores by Domain

| Domain                        | ANNA  | Cortica | NADR  |
|:------------------------------|:------|:--------|:------|
| Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) | 3.3   | 1.4     | 0.1   |
| Communication                 | 4.0   | 2.0     | 0.3   |
| Socialization                 | 7.0   | 1.4     | (0.6) |
| Daily Living Skills           | 2.8   | 1.1     | 0.2   |

*   Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales measure real-world functional skills across Communication, Socialization, and Daily Living Skills, with the Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) summarizing overall adaptive functioning.
*   ANNA clients achieved substantially greater gains across all domains compared to Cortica and the National Autism Data Repository (NADR) – a national benchmark dataset of similar client outcomes.
*   Standout performance in Socialization (+7.0 ANNA vs. +1.4 Cortica, -0.6 NADR) and strong gains in Communication (+4.0 vs. +2.0, +0.3) and Daily Living Skills (+2.8 vs. +1.1, +0.2) showcase the breadth of ANNA's clinical impact.
*   Overall ABC improvement of +3.3 more than doubles Cortica's +1.4 and far exceeds NADR's +0.1, highlighting the measurable, life-changing impact of ANNA's neuroaffirming, naturalistic intervention model.
