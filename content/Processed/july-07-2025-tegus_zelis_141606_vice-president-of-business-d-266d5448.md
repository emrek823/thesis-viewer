**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. We're trying to dig a little bit deeper into Medicare repricers and how the market prices claims to Medicare today. What are the different tools being used? I got the responses you had for some of the questions, so I have some high-level idea, but before we jump in, I'd love for you to just go over your background as it relates to some of the stuff were talking about.

**Expert**
Yeah, sure, I can do that. My background for good or for bad, is basically in the group medical insurance space. I started with Prudential a long time ago. They had a group department at that time. They sold it off to U.S. healthcare, they ran us all off, and then I went to work for a technology company called BenefitPoint that was supposed to make me rich, and it did not.

That was a tool and an organization that was designed around trying to make the brokers' lives easier in terms of the efficiencies of quoting business. It didn't work very well but they burned through $100 million and that was something. That rolled into some payroll systems. I went to work for another company called Lumenos.

In both of those operations, I took care of the Southeast markets, and basically it was broker connectivity, that was an HSA environment. I'm not sure how familiar you are with that, but the basic concept was the same group medical strategies around trying to improve the affordability, outcomes, quality, whatever it might be.

From there, I went to UnitedHealthcare, worked there for a number of years, and the same world self-funded large case UMR TPA business. We did have a bit of reference-based business, Medicare-type reference, but that wasn't widely sold. We basically were under the impression that what we had was really great.

Fast forward to today, I've worked here for several years with ClaimDOC in the reference-based space and trying to provide to the brokerage community, to the employer community opportunities for a different strategy which will produce an improved result. That's sort of a short summary of my background.

**Client**
You're in deep in the healthcare space.

**Expert**
I'm in deep, I know. I'm not sure it was a good choice, but here I am.

**Client**
Good. We'll have some interesting conversations then because I think this is all really relevant experience. I am curious where you said today, you're now with ClaimDOC, when you think about claims repricing, especially claims repricing to Medicare rates, can you help me understand the landscape of products that are used? Whether it's something that is homegrown, I know Medicare has a pricer online, but it is often one claim at a time, and then you have tools like Milliman and Wakely and 3M that offer. If you could help me just understand the landscape.

**Expert**
Yeah, I can to a degree. In terms of the community meaning groups or employers or one employer of size that's looking to offer a benefit plan that may be in this direction, reference-based, would that be okay?

**Client**
Yeah.

**Expert**
The landscape, the idea, the framework of where we are, obviously, the United States healthcare system is messed up, let's put it that way. You could use a lot of different adjectives, but the idea really originally was pretty straightforward but it's morphed into something unfortunate which is that there's a lot of players in the market that are reimbursed for action frequency versus outcomes, quality, that type of thing.

Of course, you've got the general American attitude, which is, "I don't know. Let's just get fat and take Ozempic." No offense to anyone that's overweight, but there's not a whole lot of proper eating and proper nutrition. It's like," I'll just wait and have somebody take care of it." We also fall for a lot of the medication issues. Everybody is advertised to death about drugs, so you have a very expensive environment.

You throw in regulatory issues from several years ago, where it allowed for the consolidation of a lot of these hospital systems, so you have far less competition. In the carrier world, Blue Cross, United, Cigna, where there used to be 30 or 40 different group medical carriers, there's really only four credible ones anymore.

I think what I was just pontificating on is the problems in the healthcare market, the consolidation of carriers, the consolidation of hospitals. That basic problem is that there's two parties in the market that are making reasonable profits, or a lot of profits. It would be hospital systems, and the carrier world. As prices rise, there's two parties that are making maybe the same percentage, but obviously a percentage off a substantially higher number.

The profit margins are good, the numbers, the values are good, but the employer, the one that's really getting stuck is the commercial payer, because a hospital system would say, "All right. Well, we are not making any money off indigent care. We're not making any money off of Medicaid or Medicare or maybe even cash pay, but we're going to make money off of you," and they make an enormous amount of their profits off the commercial market.

There's a group of employers out there and there's a group of employers that are, one, there's a group of employers that need some sort of relief, and then there are others that are just tired of the system, because, the system is that you see a bill charge and the bill charge is, "What is it? Where was it? Where did it come from?" The answer is pretty much it was made up.

There's a lot of detail behind it. The reality is that, if you went to every hospital in any state, I don't know where you live and let's say there's 30 hospitals here, there's same exact charge would produce 30 different build numbers. That number from a hospital system is going to be pretty wide ranging.

The environment is one where you've got few players, you've got a consolidation in the hospital market, you've got high costs. That's where people have tried to create something different, which is how reference-based pricing came into play. I don't know how much of it you want to get into as it relates to the cost structure and benchmarking and so forth.

I think we can do a pretty good job of benchmarking based upon our own experience and data relative to a carrier model, relative to percentage off of bill, percentage of Medicare, whatever it might be, we can share those numbers and produce an outcome for an employer group that would show, "Well, what if we had been in this environment versus this, what would the claims likely have been?" It's a bit of guesswork, but you can get pretty close, and you'll save 20%, 25%. I think that's a pretty reasonable expectation, in terms of what you would say by producing and implementing a reference-based plan for the membership.

**Client**
When it comes to just the infrastructure that you have in place today and maybe you've seen in other places, what does that flow look like? You have a set of claims that are coming in and maybe you're trying to sell to a new employer and they have shared their claims data with you and you're trying to figure out how to benchmark them to Medicare. Could you talk a little bit about that flow? That data flow itself?

**Expert**
The data flow is that ClaimDOC, we're not a TPA, we're not paying claims, we're not administering that part of the process, but there are dozens of reference-based players in the market. If I was a buyer, and I'm not trying to be biased, I would eliminate most of them, if not 98% of them, because any TPA can be a reference-based repricer.

Repricing claims is simple. All you do is get the schedule for Medicare, you say, "To look at a claim, this is what we'll pay. We'll pay 20% above Medicare, 25% of Medicare, whatever the number is, and we'll send it out." That's pretty simple. That doesn't really require a whole lot of intelligence. The things that are missing are the ones that are important, and I'll list them out so that and I'll talk about the flow.

The flow, first of all is the process where we're going to partner with different parties in this exercise. Different parties, meaning the TPA. There's got to be somebody to administer claims who's integrated in the beginning with us. We got to have a reinsurance partner to manage the risk, define the cost of the employer, and cover unknown claims of substantial size, so that they have to understand what we do, and so the reinsurance partner's there, the TPA's there.

There could be other things that are involved in the process that may or may not be important, obviously pharmacy is important, but we're not really managing the pharmacy expense. The claims are going to come through. Any employee's going to go, they use the ID card, they go, they get a claim. That claim comes back to the TPA and then that claim is funneled to us. All claims come through back to us. The TPA's responsibility, and they have to understand what they're doing, and not all do, there's a lot of bad TPAs, but that's a whole another conversation.

The claims will come through, and then the very first thing we do, which is probably the most significant thing that we can do to help the process, is we audit every single facility claim and every claim over $2,000. The audit process is done in-house, it's done with our team, it's done with a very sophisticated group of people, along with some other tools and details that we can pull. Things like element data and reference points, and so forth.

**Client**
Is that a manual process for auditing or are there these automated engines?

**Expert**
It's both. There's some AI activity, there's some automatic review process, but the key to success, and it's a pretty interesting process, when you hear the head of audit and the other people that go through this exercise talk about it, there's a lot of things that a machine-generated review will not catch.

These are things that a machine will say, "Okay, yeah, that's an eligible client, that's an eligible drug," but how about the frequency of the drug? How about how many units that that person was delivered? What about why is the emergency room charging for sheets or for certain mechanical tools that have to be in there to track?

There's all kinds of specific things that have to be watched, and so the manual process is key to success, but the process of audit, the process of review, does two important things. One, what we're working with, with facilities is a pretty complex system. Tens of thousands of ICD-10 codes and all sorts of different iterations of the coding.

I don't blame it all in the hospital systems, but I do say that, because nurses are they got to keep patients moving, and they know, "If I put this code in, that patient will be allowed to move along," but the reality is that these hospital systems have also invested heavily in what they call efficiency systems.

They're coding basically upcoding devices and systems that allow for them to maximize revenue per patient, and what all that's doing is just creating all types of variations of codes and procedures to say that this person isn't level one and the ER is level four, whatever it might be. If you're not watching for that, and I can guarantee you the carriers are not watching for it, then you're really going to be taken advantage of. I only say that because the audit process results for us can be huge. The things that we see and that we extract from a bill, this is before we even apply Medicare reimbursement percentages, the things that we remove can be relatively minor or they can be huge.

In total, for our book, there's a substantial amount of money that's being extracted from the starting point. That's step one, and that audit process is really important because the audit process is also providing us as a co-fiduciary, this is probably the second most significant overlooked thing in a claim repricing process.

You have to have a partner who is a co-fiduciary to be able to protect the member to the limits of the plan, to be able to defend the plan sponsor for any legal expense and exposure and be able to push back against what these hospital systems are saying they're going to do, they're going to balance bill, they're going to take someone's credit, whatever it is.

You have to have some sort of detail behind the scenes, you have to have some sort of leverage that says, "Wait a minute, you submitted a $50,000 bill of which $20,000 shouldn't have even been there, and we paid you in this fashion. What's your problem?" When I say paid you in this fashion, we pay the higher of 125% of Medicare or 120% of the actual cost of charge.

The cost of charge is what that hospital reports to CMS, the government entity regulated process. What we do is we catch that data, we capture it and we say, "Look, we want to be fair, we want you to get a fair profit, so we're going to pay you a fair margin if your costs are really already over the Medicare reimbursement because of where you are, because your patient makes whatever, okay, great, we're going to pay a 20% margin on that. If it's not, we'll pay 125% margin, give you a 25% margin on that."

That's more than half their business in those categories, so what's wrong with that is profit margin. All we're trying to do is inject fairness, but that doesn't always work. We want to say, "Look, we're going to pay the higher up, we're going to audit the claim, we're going to defend that position." Sometimes that's like, "Nope, we don't accept that and we're going to balance bill to member," which is where you need a co-fiduciary, where you need to have legal representation and support that stands behind the member but has actual details that allow to have leverage in the settlement of the claim.

**Client**
Can I ask you, what you're describing sounds a little bit like payment integrity. I think there's a few new players, Bluespine and finHealth are here in this space, and then there's obviously the more traditional payment integrity that's more focused on the payers, whether it's Cotiviti or Zelis or others, does it play in this space as well or how do you position?

**Expert**
Yeah. Zelis, for instance, they own one of the reference-based players, AMPS, I think, or something. MultiPlan owns HST, which owns a TPA. Imagine360, they own a TPA, and they own a pharmacy, and they do some of these same things in the audit process. I think, to me, some of the differentiation really rests with what is it that you're producing and who's producing it.

Are you using a third party? If I'm going to HST, which is just a repricer, they'll have a menu of choices, and they'll refer you out to a law firm or they'll refer out to an audit process, or maybe the audit is only on balance bill, how many of the claims are audited, and is it done in-house or is it done through a third party? Is it prepayment or post-payment? Is it part of the cost, or is it separate from the cost?

All we're saying is there's a lot of players, a lot of things to vet and so forth, but if you want a complete package of risk of audit, of support of member management, employer liability of reinsurance partners of quality TPAs that have been vetted, you come to us and we do all those things. We're not going to charge you a menu of items, a menu of charges.

We don't really need to necessarily compete with that so much, but just tell the story, and logically, people can often make, for the most part of the time, the story to be credible and I'm like, "Okay, I get it, that's probably worth something to combine those things together."

**Client**
Maybe on that note, I'm curious to hear your take. What I've been hearing in the market is you had payment integrity on the payer side, especially on the fully insured side of the business that's been strong. The self-insured side of the market, the employer market, has traditionally maybe underinvested in payment integrity. I'm curious if you have a take on why that is.

**Expert**
I wouldn't necessarily agree with the premise. I think that payment integrity on a fully insured side just means that someone else is liable for it. If I'm buying from Blue Cross and it's fully insured, then the problems associated with high claims or hemophiliac or something to do with NSA with no surprise act, which is a whole other topic if you want to get into it.

Those things are somebody else's problem, so those are going to go. I'm not sure that the payment integrity is any better because when I worked for UnitedHealthcare and we went into this whole thing about the audit process, maybe it only occurred on self-funded plans, but it didn't occur on insured plans. The audit process was a retrospective review, and we could bring a client in, and they could take some claims, and they could review those claims.

Great. What does that mean? Almost nothing. It's like, we've already paid it, so what are you going to do? You go get the money back somehow? The insured part of the story relieves the employer of concern, worry, and liability, but I still think that the arrangement behind the scenes, which for self-funded, let's take United Healthcare, who I work for.

United Healthcare has a contract with a hospital system. That contract is for insured or self-funded clients. It's no different. If a member comes in and they've got an insured card, great, it's paid at whatever, let's say it's 50% of bill charge. They go and self-fund 50% of bill charge, so the integrity standard is the same.

The challenge with self-funding is that the employer now has ongoing liability that's ever-increasing with new drugs, new complexities, new procedures, new costs, new all kinds of strategies from the hospital players that are out there to maximize their revenue. There's a necessity on the self-funded side to like, "Hey, this is my money, I need to do something about it." I think that maybe they're more visible on the self-funded side, but I don't think they're more present on the insured side.

**Client**
Interesting. One of the takes I've heard is on the fully insured side of the business because your United, your Cigna Blue Cross, is the one basically taking the risk. They're much more on top of trying to audit these claims and get them edited and repriced. For some of the self-insured side of the business, employers maybe are either upsold on additional payment integrity offerings that they have to buy into because it's the employer's money essentially that is on the line. Employers have traditionally haven't been the savviest buyers of healthcare and have missed out on what's been happening on the payment integrity side. That's one theory I've heard of.

**Expert**
I think you could probably say that some of the reasons that the insurance marketplace and why the CEO of United got assassinated is because people wrongly believe that they're out there, maybe not completely wrongly, but there is a restriction process. The carrier is trying to limit inappropriate charges that are going out on a regular basis.

You're dealing with a lot of bad players in the marketplace. I'm not saying that the carriers are innocent from that, but what they're trying to do with pre-auth and limitations on services and limitations on days for things like chiropractic care, whatever those limitations are, those are available to be built into a self-funded plan.

You can have pre-auth, you can have limits on services. You probably have more flexibilities. You certainly do have more flexibilities in the self-funded world, but you're also getting away from the regulatory environment of state mandates. It's a trade-off, but again, I'm stuck with the fact that any self-funded plan can do as much as they want to try to limit the plan. They could even go to the extent of extracting specialty drugs from the pharmacy plan if they wanted to. I've seen people do it. There are ways that you can get around it. You can put stronger pre auth limitations on benefits.

Whether it's payment integrity, whether it's limitations on services or costs or activity. You could probably answer it any different way, and you get the same result. Everybody's just trying to save money, and try to keep the employees from complaining, which has never happened. Employees have never stopped complaining.

It doesn't really matter what you offer them. It's like this sucks. Unless you work for Amazon or Google or something, and you know you're going to have some caviar for lunch that's free and you get 100% benefit plan. It's not like the normal people are happy with their benefit plan. There's always some limitation on it.

**Client**
Yeah. Maybe going back to the Medicare repricers. How is the repricing happening in the sense that, let's say, you have a batch of claims that you got? Are you sending it over to Milliman to get it repriced? Are you doing it in-house? What is the actual maybe specific happening?

**Expert**
Right, it's all done. We're not using Milliman. Milliman might be used for reference data and things like that, but they're not doing anything for us or with us. We're not doing anything with other third parties like that. It's not really necessary. If I give you a visual of a case. Let's say the case is 1,000 lives, and on a normal case of 1,000 lives, that maybe there's 20,000 claims, meaning individual claims that have been incurred by that membership in a year.

Of the 20,000 claims, about 19,000 of those claims are going to be professional service claims, meaning primary care, specialty care, little stuff like go get some blood work done, whatever it might be. They're just professional services. The remaining 1,000 are going to be facility-type charges of some nature and they could be significant or insignificant. Almost all the savings on reference-based pricing is coming from that small segment of claims.

When we talk about claims flowing through the system, we're not really affecting and saving much money on all the professional service claims. We may have direct contracts with imaging centers and things like that. That's fine because they're open to it because they have competition, because they need to incent membership into their facility and they know they can operate on a lower margin.

The majority of claims are flowing through the system. They come to the TPA, they come to us, we review them, we send them back. It's just a flow. It happens every day, 24 hours a day. It's just flowing through. The claims that are over $2,000 are facility claims. Those we're pulling, we're extracting, we're auditing them. They may go out the same day or the next day or depending on the complexity, a few days later.

We need to get itemized bills, we need to get details about those claims. That process is where we're doing a lot more deep dive into that facility claim because we're getting specific UB-04 information in detail. The flow of information is coming from that, our reference points, meaning whether it's Medicare or whether it's their actual cost of charges coming from data that we've extracted from a variety of sources.

Some of it could be Milliman. A lot of it has to do with details that are available that are supposed to be made public by the facilities in terms of their actual cost of services, and so forth, or we may have to make averages. If the hospital hasn't reported, even though that's required by law, specific costs for their services under the No Surprise Act, then we'll take an aggregate average for that particular zip code or market area, and we'll apply that, and we'll pay them off of that. That process is all done in-house with us anyway.

When you're referencing the market of repricers, we're doing that, but a lot of people don't do any of that. You can get a simple regulatory summary of Medicare costs and then just reprice off of that. You're not getting any details for markets, you're not getting any variations for zips or hospitals. That's where you run into a lot of trouble because you've taken a hospital system, and let's say their costs are extremely high based on a variety of factors and they're far higher than Medicare.

Really, what we should be paying them is not 125% of Medicare, it's probably more like 160% of Medicare, to give them a fair profit margin. If you're out there and you've got a group and their lives are in that market and you're repricing claims at Medicare, every one of those claims is starting to hurt that facility, and now they're getting irritated.

The reality of reference base is we're only a small segment of the population of claims, maybe 5% of the overall market. In any given market, it's even smaller than that. A lot of the reason that claims flow through these facilities is just because they're not going to deal with all this. It's like, "Okay, we got paid, fine, keep it moving."

The billing department just wants things to keep moving. They want to get paid and they want to move that claim off of the bad debt books, and boom. You don't really get a lot of pushback, but when they see that they're losing money or they're getting an unreasonable amount of money, now they're going to start to pull those balance bill, those create member angst, there's going to be noise, HR is going to be unhappy, the C-Suite is going to get involved.

That's where reference base gets all kinds of bad rap and attitude. The flow is just like any other case. We're not sending it out, we're not doing anything. We're not asking anyone to do anything. We're just taking data that's available publicly and utilizing it for the payment process. Additionally, part of the process also is not just that rote "Boom, we're just going to put it in a system and pay it." If there's a particular provider in a particular market that the only pediatrician in town, and they're not open to working with us. "Well, okay, you want 150%, 180% of Medicare, that's fine. We'll do individual contracts for those people."

Part of ClaimDOC's exercise is to reach out to every single provider of every single member up front and ongoing. We want the provider to know what the ID card is, what they're going to get paid, and accept prior to the member going to them, that member, either on a continuation basis or on a new basis.

We get a 94% acceptance in that process of what we call pave the way. There's a lot of things that go behind the scenes to try to make the process of a member's experience work better. Like any healthcare plan option, it has some issues from time to time, but I would tend to say that the savings outweigh the downside.

**Client**
No, it's great. Maybe one final question I'd ask is getting back to the original intent of the conversation. Do you think there would be value in having you have access to a platform where you could basically upload? Let's say you have those 20,000 claims, you upload a file of those 20,000 claims, and all of the geo- and zip-level repricing that Medicare does, that happens, and you essentially get a repriced version of that entire batch of claims repriced through the platform? Do you think there's value in that, or the system you have is good enough and you don't really need another platform, whether it's free, low-cost, or any amount?

**Expert**
The question sounds like it's steering toward a company that's offering a service that would provide some sort of value to a repricer, which I suppose, for someone that's just basic, they're just doing a simple repricing exercise, probably useful. The challenge with us is that what we're doing, and because as a co-fiduciary, we're legally responsible to protect the member for the limits of the benefit plan, we're protecting the member and the plan sponsor. The plan sponsor we're protecting for the life of the claim. These liabilities are not insignificant.

In some cases, we may have 10-12 ongoing litigation events at any one time. What we have to have is we have to have detail and data that we've supported and we understand, and to a degree of built, but probably the most consequential piece of that, that can't be reproduced by anyone is the audit process.

We can do a claims projection. If we take a claims file and we can do a claims projection off the data that we have and project where those claims would be going forward. Now, what we can't really do is take a high claim and say what exactly would that have been, should it have been claimed on.

Without the itemized bill, without the detail, without the UB-04 data, then you're not going to be able to determine whether or not there was a hospital-acquired condition or there was a duplication of charge or whether there was 800 units of medication applied to a four-year-old when only one would have killed them.

Those things are not measurable, and they're quite significant in cost and in consequence. I think the answer to the question would be probably for us, I don't know, I'd probably say no, but I wouldn't be the one to define that. We're always happy to look at things and present them out to the leadership. If there's something magical there that would help us, I'm sure that would be open to it.

**Client**
Okay. Well, thank you again for taking the time to speak with us today. This was very helpful. Enjoy the rest of your day.
