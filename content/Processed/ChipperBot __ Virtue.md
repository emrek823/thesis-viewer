### ChipperBot Business Overview

- Three cofounders: Josh (formerly BetterOmics), Tristan, Kyle (all currently at Grail)
- Building AI-powered operational intelligence for life sciences labs
- Targeting biotech/pharma ops leaders struggling with instrument downtime, manual processes
- Strategic positioning to avoid FDA validation requirements
	- Won’t touch validated chemistry processes
	- Extracts data from around validated systems
	- Focuses on operational efficiency vs. core science
- Why now: Modern LLMs can read instrument logs like humans, building context around equipment issues

### Customer Traction & Go-to-Market

- DTU (Denmark research institution): Deployed pilot for 1-2 months after validation
- JGI: Successful pilot assessment this morning, moving forward
- Active conversations: Solterio, Genentech, LabCorp (slower enterprise sales)
- EditCo (Synthago spinout): Early stage, contact had baby
- March timeline: Full-time launch when Grail stock vests (March 28th)
- Post-launch priorities:

### Fundraising & Partnership Needs

- Raising $4M seed round at launch
- Seeking VC partners with:
	- Healthcare connections (lack network beyond biopharma/diagnostics)
	- First-time founder experience/guidance
	- Industry expertise in hospital/health system buyers
- Healthcare expansion opportunity: Same technology, different buyer (CTO/engineering vs. ops leaders)
- Current setup: Entity established, MSAs completed, Grail conflict clearance obtained
