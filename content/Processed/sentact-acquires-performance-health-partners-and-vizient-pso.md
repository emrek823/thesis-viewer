What You Should Know:

– Sentact has executed a major strategic expansion by acquiring two significant players in the patient safety space: Performance Health Partners (PHP), the #1 Best-in-KLAS provider of safety incident management software, and the Vizient Patient Safety Organization (PSO), one of the nation’s largest PSOs.

– The double acquisition positions Sentact to offer a comprehensive, end-to-end safety platform that combines top-tier incident reporting technology with deep analytical insights and a federally protected environment for data sharing.

– As part of the deal, PHP Founder Heidi Raines joins Sentact as Chief Strategy Officer, signaling a unified push to help healthcare organizations proactively reduce preventable harm.

Sentact Builds a “Zero Harm” Ecosystem with PHP and Vizient PSO Acquisitions

In a healthcare landscape where “zero harm” is the ultimate, yet elusive, metric, fragmented technology has often been the enemy. Today, Sentact moved to solve that fragmentation with a decisive double acquisition that reshapes the patient safety technology market. The company announced it has acquired Performance Health Partners (PHP), the three-time Best-in-KLAS leader in safety event management, alongside the Vizient Patient Safety Organization (PSO), a massive federally listed entity serving over 300 healthcare organizations.

This is not merely a rollup of assets; it is the construction of a vertical stack for safety. By combining Sentact’s existing clinical operations platform with PHP’s incident reporting engine and the Vizient PSO’s protected data environment, Sentact is attempting to close the loop between reporting an error, analyzing its root cause, and sharing those learnings across the industry.

Integrating the “Best-in-KLAS” Standard

The acquisition of PHP brings immediate technological credibility to Sentact’s portfolio. PHP has been ranked #1 by KLAS for Healthcare Safety, Risk, and Compliance Management Software for three consecutive years—a rare feat in a competitive software market.

PHP’s core value proposition has always been its configurability. Its flagship solution streamlines the entire lifecycle of a safety incident, from the initial report at the bedside to final resolution. By integrating this capability, Sentact moves beyond general clinical operations into the high-stakes arena of risk management.

Heidi Raines, Founder and CEO of PHP, will join Sentact as Chief Strategy Officer. “Joining Sentact enables us to significantly expand our reach and deliver even more value to the organizations we have proudly served for over a decade,” Raines stated. Her transition to the C-suite suggests that PHP’s DNA will play a central role in Sentact’s future product roadmap.

The Strategic Value of the Vizient PSO

While the PHP deal is a technology play, the acquisition of the Vizient PSO is an intelligence play. Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs) were created by federal legislation to provide a safe harbor where clinicians can voluntarily report medical errors without fear of legal discovery. The Vizient PSO is one of the largest in the country, with 332 participating organizations, including academic medical centers, ambulatory clinics, and long-term care facilities.

For Sentact, owning this PSO means owning the network. It allows the company to offer clients not just software tools, but a “legally protected space for sharing information and learning from other organizations.” This creates a powerful network effect: the more organizations that use Sentact’s platform, the richer the comparative safety data becomes for every member of the PSO.
