### Background

- Meeting with Jeremy from P74 Ventures, former Novartis executive
- Has 30 years experience in healthcare/life sciences
- Previously at MPM Capital, led Novartis ventures (DRX Capital with 21 investments, 5 exits, 5 unicorns)
- Partner at P74 is former Chief Digital Officer for Novartis US
- Broad pharma focus across value chain, particularly commercial side

### P74 Ventures Status

- Currently operating as fundless fund doing SPVs
- Two incubation companies in development
- Market timing challenges for fund raising
- Launching $150-200M biotech credit fund
- Focus on commercial side of pharma - viewed as greenfield opportunity

### Incubation Company 1: Advocare

- Developed from multiple US pilot projects
- Core focus: Quality of care measurement and improvement
- Key statistics:
	- Average quality of care is 40% across therapeutic areas
	- Best case reaches 70%
	- Heart failure study showed only 1% getting best practice care
- Product features:
	- Rapid health record analysis (~1 minute)
	- AI-driven gap analysis
	- Personalized care quality assessment
	- Recommendation engine for doctor conversations
- Commercial model:
	- Grant rate increases from 40% to 80% with patient education (validated with Entresto and Cosentyx)
	- Alternative to $35B spent on DTC advertising
	- Highly ethical approach using free education/coaching based on PHR
	- Worth “100x” compared to traditional TV ads
	- Example: Pluvicto (Novartis prostate cancer drug) - willing to pay $7,500 per patient

### Incubation Company 2: Vue

- Built with Microsoft + OpenAI for med-legal-regulatory review
- Features:
	- Automated MLR review (vs orchestration)
	- Complete content generation flywheel
	- Human-in-loop options
	- Content creation and dissemination
	- Focus on web channel optimization
- Problem solving:
	- Most pharma websites “dead on arrival”
	- Sites typically updated only every 1-2 years
- Business model:
	- Short term: Complement agencies (MLR internal, content via agencies)
	- Long term: Replace agencies upstream
	- Faster, cheaper content creation
	- Integrated distribution engine
	- Potential acquisition target for agencies

### Next Steps

- Follow up on materials for Advocare and Vue
- Explore complementary portfolio companies
- Discuss potential collaborations in pharma tech space
