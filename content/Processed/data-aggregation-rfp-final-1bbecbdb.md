## 1.0 PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND

#### PURPOSE

The Plan is seeking a Vendor to provide data aggregation services for population health analysis and management. The Plan requires a Vendor that brings best in class population health analysis expertise of demographic, medical, pharmacy, and provider data to provide insights about the Plan's approximately 572,000 self-funded members. Vendor must be capable of using modern data analysis methods and tools to provide summary and detail level reporting and/or graphical representations that can be used by the Plan's Board, Leadership and stakeholders to make data driven decisions.

Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the terms and conditions of this RFP and any addenda issued hereto.

#### BACKGROUND

**State Health Plan**

The Plan provides health benefits coverage to more than 740,000 teachers and school personnel, State employees, retirees, current and former lawmakers, State university and community college personnel, and eligible dependents. The Services outlined in this RFP are focused on the approximately 572,000 self-funded Members. The mission of the State Health Plan is to improve the health and health care of North Carolina teachers, State employees, retirees, and their dependents, in a financially sustainable manner, thereby serving as a model to the people of North Carolina for improving their health and well-being.

**Governance**

The Treasurer, Executive Administrator, and the Board are designated as fiduciaries for the Plan. The powers and duties of the Treasurer are set forth in statute at N.C.G.S. § 135-48.30(a) and include setting benefits, premium rates, co-pays, deductibles, and coinsurance percentages and maximums subject to approval of the Board. The Board's powers and duties are set forth at N.C.G.S. § 135-22 and include approving large contracts; approving premium rates, copays, and deductibles proposed by the Treasurer; and developing and maintaining a strategic plan. The North Carolina General Assembly determines member eligibility rules and establishes certain premium levels for the Plan.

**Plan Designs**

The Plan currently offers three self-funded Plan Designs. Two are copay-based PPO plans and one is a HDHP. The Plan Designs are evaluated on an annual basis and are likely to change prior to 2026.

**Plan Vendors**

The Plan contracts with a number of vendors to provide third party administrative, pharmacy benefit management and other related services:
* Aetna Life Insurance Company ("Aetna”) is the contracted TPA for Claims and Related services for the Plan's three self-funded plan options.
* Humana, Inc., provides the two fully insured Medicare Advantage Plans.
* Caremark PCS Health, LLC, provides Pharmacy Benefit Management services (“PBM”).
* Benefitfocus is the Plan's eligibility and enrollment services (“EES”) vendor.
* iTEDIUM provides COBRA administration and billing services.
* Healthcare Horizons is the Plan's current vendor for medical claims audit services.

### 2.3 NOTICE TO VENDORS REGARDING RFP TERMS AND CONDITIONS

It shall be the Vendor's responsibility to read the Instructions to Vendors, the General Terms and Conditions, all relevant exhibits and attachments, and any other components made a part of this RFP and to comply with all requirements and specifications herein. Vendors are also responsible for obtaining and complying with all Addenda and other changes that may be issued in connection with this RFP.

If the Vendors have questions or issues regarding any component of this RFP, those must be submitted as questions in accordance with the instructions in Section 2.5 Proposal Questions and, among others, Section III of Attachment B: Instructions to Vendors. If the Plan determines that any changes will be made as a result of the questions asked, then such decisions will be communicated in the form of an Addendum to this RFP.

Other than as part of the process of negotiation as outlined by this RFP, the Plan rejects and will not be required to evaluate or consider any additional or modified terms and conditions submitted with Vendor's proposal or otherwise.

Vendor's Proposal shall constitute a firm offer that shall be held open for the period required herein ("Validity Period" above).

The Plan may exercise its discretion to consider modifications proposed by Vendors, but only if those modifications are proposed during the question-and-answer period in accordance with Section 2.5 Proposal Questions. By execution and delivery of this RFP Response, Vendor agrees that any additional or modified terms and conditions, whether submitted purposely or inadvertently, shall have no force or effect, and will be disregarded, unless expressly agreed upon through negotiation and incorporated by way of a BAFO.

Questions received prior to the submission deadline date in Section 2.4 RFP Schedule, the Plan's response, and any additional terms deemed necessary by the State will be posted in the form of an Addendum to the electronic Vendor Portal, https://evp.nc.gov, and shall become an Addendum to this RFP. The Plan may also elect to leave open the possibility for later negotiation and amendment of specific provisions of the RFP that have been addressed during the question period.

No information, instruction or advice provided orally or informally by any Plan personnel, whether made in response to a question or otherwise in connection with this RFP, shall be considered authoritative or binding.

dd. **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**: Documentation of the agreed-upon target dates for meeting milestones and Deliverables that must be completed for the provision of Services to Go-Live.

## 3.0 METHOD OF AWARD AND PROPOSAL EVALUATION PROCESS

### 3.1 METHOD OF AWARD

All Qualified Proposals will be evaluated, and awards will be made to the Vendor(s) meeting the specifications of this RFP and achieving the highest and best final evaluation, based on the criteria described below.

While the intent of this RFP is to award a Contract to a single Vendor, the Plan reserves the right to make separate awards to different Vendors for one or more line-items, to not award one or more line-items or to cancel this RFP in its entirety without awarding a Contract if it is considered to be most advantageous to the Plan to do so.

The Plan reserves the right to waive any minor informality or technicality in Proposals received.

### 3.2 CONFIDENTIALITY AND PROHIBITED COMMUNICATIONS DURING EVALUATION

While this RFP is under evaluation, the responding Vendor, including any Subcontractors and suppliers, is prohibited from engaging in conversations intended to influence the outcome of the evaluation. For more specific information on prohibited communications, see Section V, Paragraph 25 of Attachment B: Instructions to Vendors.

### 3.3 PROPOSAL EVALUATION PROCESS

The Plan shall review all Vendor responses to this RFP to confirm that they meet the specifications and requirements of the RFP. Only Responsive submissions will be evaluated.

a) **The Plan will conduct a One-Step evaluation of Proposals:**

Proposals will be received according to the method stated in Section 2.6 Proposal Submittal above.

All Proposals must be received by the issuing agency not later than the date and time specified in Section 2.4 RFP Schedule above, unless modified by an Addendum. Vendors are cautioned that this is a request for offers, not an offer or request to contract, and the Plan reserves the unqualified right to reject any and all offers at any time if such rejection is deemed to be in the best interest of the Plan, as described in, among others, Section V, Paragraph 11 of Attachment B: Instructions to Vendors.

At their option, the evaluators may request oral presentations or discussions with any or all of the Vendors for Clarification or to amplify the materials presented in any part of the Proposal. The Vendors are cautioned, however, that the evaluators are not required to request presentations or other Clarification—and often do not. Therefore, all Proposals should be complete and reflect the most favorable terms available from the Vendor.

The Plan shall conduct a comprehensive, fair, and impartial evaluation of the Proposals received in response to this request. Specific evaluation criteria are listed in Section 3.4 Evaluation Criteria below.

Upon completion of the evaluation process, including all necessary approvals, the Plan will make award(s) based on the evaluation and post the award(s) to eVP under the RFP number for this solicitation. Award of a Contract to one Vendor does not mean that the other Proposals lacked merit, but that, all factors considered, the selected Proposal was deemed most advantageous and represented the best value to the Plan.

The Plan reserves the right to negotiate with one or more Vendors, or to reject all original offers and negotiate with one or more sources of supply that may be capable of satisfying the requirement, and in either case to require the Vendor to submit

## Proposal Number: 270-20250407DAS

Vendor:

a BAFO based on discussions and negotiations with the Plan. If a BAFO is requested, then, once the Vendors' BAFOs are received, the Plan will recalculate the score as appropriate.

b) **Evaluation Committee**

An Evaluation Committee ("Committee") will be established to review each Proposal and recommend to the Executive Administrator a Vendor to be awarded the Contract. The Plan may engage the professional services of a different Plan vendor to assist in the evaluation process. The Plan reserves the right to alter the composition of the Committee or to designate other staff to assist in the process. Other designated staff and senior management from the Department of State Treasurer may attend any oral presentations that may occur during the evaluation process. However, all decisions regarding scoring and the final award recommendation will be made solely by Committee members.

The Committee will review and evaluate all Proposals that were submitted by the deadline specified in this RFP. This Committee will be responsible for the entire evaluation process and the evaluation will be conducted in accordance with the steps outlined below. Committee participants are obligated to keep information identified as trade secret and proprietary confidential.

Technical Proposals meeting the Minimum Requirements described in Section 5.1 will be considered and evaluated as follows:

1. **Evaluation of Technical Proposal**
    * Written Technical Proposal (Section 5.2.1 Standard Services, which includes Section 5.2.1.1 Implementation, 5.2.1.2 Account Management, 5.2.1.3 Business Solutions, and 5.2.1.4 User Experience)
2. **Evaluation of Cost Proposal**
3. **Determination of Successful Proposal Based on the Combination of Technical & Cost**
4. **Adjustment of Score After BAFO, if Applicable**

c) **Approval for Contract Award**

After approval by the Board, if applicable, and the Attorney General's Office, if applicable, the Plan's Executive Administrator will award the Contract to the bidder with the highest score. A Contract is not binding until the Plan's Executive Administrator has signed the Acceptance of Proposal.

### 3.4 EVALUATION CRITERIA

Proposals meeting the Minimum Requirements described in Section 5.1 will be evaluated under the Points-Based Evaluation methodology, and awarded based on the following criteria, to result in an award most advantageous to the Plan. The Technical Proposal and the Cost Proposal will be scored separately based on the overall point scale described below.

The total points scale will reflect the following weights:

| | Weight |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| Technical Proposal | 50%    |
| Cost Proposal      | 50%    |
| **Total:**         | **100%** |

## Proposal Number: 270-20250407DAS

Vendor:

Both the Technical Proposal and Cost Proposal will be based upon a maximum of 37 points each. Each item to be confirmed in the Technical Requirements shall be assigned one point. The following example will include the technical requirements to be evaluated.

| **Total**                 | **37**         |

The State will evaluate Cost Proposals submitted in accordance with Attachment A. The State will determine low cost by normalizing the scores as follows:

The Proposal with the lowest cost will receive a score of 37. All other competing Proposals will be assigned a portion of the maximum score using the formula:

37 X [2 – (The cost of the Cost Proposal being evaluated / The cost of the lowest cost Proposal)]

Vendors are cautioned that this is a request for offers, not a request to contract, and the State reserves the unqualified right to reject any and all offers when such rejection is deemed to be in the best interest of the State.

The Vendor shall complete ATTACHMENT E: LOCATION OF WORKERS UTILIZED BY VENDOR.

### ATTACHMENT B: INSTRUCTIONS TO VENDORS

**I. READ, REVIEW AND COMPLY**

It shall be the Vendor's responsibility to read this entire document; review all enclosures, attachments, and any Addenda; and comply with all requirements specified, whether appearing in these Instructions to the Vendors or elsewhere in the RFP document.

Any gender-specific pronouns used herein, whether masculine or feminine, shall be read and construed as gender neutral, and the singular of any word or phrase shall be read to include the plural and vice versa.

**II. NATURE OF PROPOSALS**

The Vendors are cautioned that this is a Request For Proposals, not an offer or request to contract, and the Plan reserves the unqualified right to reject any and all bids at any time if such rejection is deemed to be in the best interest of the Plan.

By submitting Your Bid or Proposal, You are offering to enter into a contract with the Plan.

The Contract is a separate document that represents the Vendor's and the Plan's entire agreement. If Your bid is accepted and results in a Contract, You will be expected to accept the General Terms And Conditions included in this RFP document as part of the Contract. Depending upon the good or service being offered, other terms and conditions may apply.

**III. DUTY TO INQUIRE**

It is the Vendor's duty to read this RFP document in its entirety. The Vendor represents that it has read and understands the RFP and that its Offer is made in compliance with the RFP. The Vendors are expected to examine the RFP thoroughly and shall request an explanation for any ambiguities, discrepancies, errors, omissions, or conflicting statements identified by the Vendor in the RFP. Failure to do so waives the Vendor's right to contest any such issue at a later date. All ambiguities, discrepancies, errors, omissions, or conflicting statements in the RFP shall be interpreted to require the better quality or greater quantity of work and/or materials, unless otherwise directed by an Addendum. The Vendor assumes responsibility for any patent ambiguity in the RFP that the Vendor does not bring to the State's attention.

**IV. INTERPRETATION OF TERMS AND PHRASES**

The RFP document serves two functions: (1) to advise potential Vendors of the parameters of the solution being sought by the Plan; and (2) to provide, together with other documents as specified in Section 4.14, the terms of the Contract resulting from this procurement. The use of phrases such as “shall,” “must,” and “requirements” are intended to create enforceable contract conditions. In determining whether bids should be evaluated or rejected, the Plan will take into consideration the degree to which the Vendors have proposed or failed to propose solutions that will satisfy the Plan's needs as described in the RFP. Except as specifically stated in the RFP, no one requirement shall automatically disqualify a Vendor from consideration. However, failure to comply with any single requirement may result in the Plan exercising its discretion to reject a Proposal in its entirety.

**V. BID SUBMISSION**

1. **VENDOR’S REPRESENTATIVE:** Each Vendor shall submit with its bid the name, address, and telephone number of the person(s) with authority to bind the Vendor and answer questions or provide Clarification concerning the Vendor's bid.

2. **SIGNING YOUR PROPOSAL:** Every Proposal must be signed by an individual with actual authority to bind the Vendor.

a) If the Vendor is an individual, the Proposal must be signed by that individual. If the Vendor is an individual doing business as a firm, the Proposal must be submitted in the firm name, signed by the individual, and state that the individual is doing business as a firm.

b) If the Vendor is a partnership, the Proposal must be submitted in the partnership name, followed by the words "by its Partner", and signed by a general partner.

c) If the Vendor is a corporation, the Proposal must be submitted in the corporate name, followed by the signature and title of the person authorized to sign.

d) A Proposal may be submitted by a joint venture involving any combination of individuals, partnerships, or corporations. If the Vendor is a joint venture, the Proposal must be submitted in the name of the Joint Venture and signed by every participant in the joint venture in the manner prescribed in paragraphs (a) through (c) above for each

35

---

## Proposal Number: 270-20250407DAS

Vendor:

type of participant.

e) If a Proposal is signed by an agent, other than as stated in subparagraphs (a) through (d) above, the Proposal must state that is has been signed by an Agent. Upon request, the Vendor must provide proof of the agent's authorization to bind the principal.

3. **EXECUTION:** Failure to sign the Execution Page (numbered page 1 of the RFP document) in the indicated space may render a Proposal nonresponsive, and it may be rejected.

4. **STATE OFFICE CLOSINGS:** If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal government processes so that Proposals cannot be received at the State office designated for receipt of bids by the exact time specified in the RFP, the time specified for receipt of Proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the RFP on the first workday on which normal government processes resume. In lieu of an automatic extension, an Addendum may be issued to reschedule the bid opening. If State offices are closed at the time a pre-bid or pre-proposal conference is scheduled, an Addendum will be issued to reschedule the conference.

5. **BID IN ENGLISH and DOLLARS:** Proposals submitted in response to this RFP shall be in the English language and in US dollars, unless otherwise permitted by the RFP.

6. **LATE BIDS:** Late bids, regardless of cause, will not be opened or considered, and will automatically be disqualified from further consideration. It shall be the Vendor's sole responsibility to ensure delivery at the designated office by the designated time.

a) The Vendor shall bear the risk for late submission due to unintended or unanticipated delay—whether submitted electronically, delivered by hand, courier, or other delivery service. It is the Vendor's sole responsibility to ensure that its bid has been received by the Plan by the specified time and date of opening. The date and time of submission will be marked on each bid when received, and any bid received after the bid submission deadline will be rejected.

b) The U.S. Postal Service does not deliver mail to a specified street address but to the State's Mail Service Center. Due to the likelihood of delay in delivery, the Vendors are not permitted to utilize the U.S. Postal Service to submit their Proposals. Instead, the Vendors must use a different parcel or package delivery service. Moreover, attempts to submit a proposal via facsimile (FAX) machine, telephone, or email in response to this RFP shall NOT be accepted.

7. **DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIVENESS:** Any Proposal which fails to conform to the material requirements of the RFP may be rejected as nonresponsive. Proposals which impose conditions that modify material requirements of the RFP may be rejected. Any deficiency resulting from a minor informality may be cured or waived at the sole discretion of the Plan.

8. **CONTENTS OF PROPOSAL:**

a) Proposals should be complete and carefully worded and should convey all of the information requested.

b) Proposals should be prepared simply and economically, providing a straightforward, concise description of the Vendor's capabilities to satisfy the requirements of the RFP. Emphasis should be on completeness and clarity of content.

c) If Your Proposal includes any comment over and above the specific information requested in the RFP, You are to include this information as a separate appendix to Your Proposal. Proposals which include either modifications to any of the RFP's contractual requirements or a Vendor's standard terms and conditions may be deemed non-responsive and not considered for award at the Plan's discretion.

9. **MULTIPLE PROPOSALS.** If specifically stated in the RFP document, the Vendors may submit more than one Proposal, provided that each Proposal has significant differences other than price. Each separate Proposal must satisfy all RFP requirements.

10. **CLARIFICATION:** The Plan may elect to communicate with You after bid opening for the purpose of clarifying either Your Proposal or the requirements of the RFP. Such communications may be conducted only with the Vendors who have submitted a Proposal which obviously conforms in all material aspects to the RFP. Clarification of a Proposal must be documented in writing and included with the Proposal. Clarifications may not be used to revise a Proposal or the RFP.

11. **ACCEPTANCE AND REJECTION:** The Plan reserves the right to reject any and all bids, to waive any informality in bids and, unless otherwise specified by the Vendor, to accept any item in the bid. If either a unit price or an extended price is obviously in error and the other is obviously correct, the incorrect price will be disregarded. Regardless of error or omission, a Vendor shall not be permitted to increase its pricing after the deadline for submitting bids.

12. **BASIS FOR REJECTION:** The Plan reserves the right to reject any and all Proposals, in whole or in part, by deeming the

36

---

## Proposal Number: 270-20250407DAS

Vendor:

Proposal unsatisfactory as to quality or quantity, delivery, price or service offered, non-compliance with the requirements or intent of this RFP, lack of competitiveness, error(s) in specifications or indications that revision would be advantageous to the Plan, cancellation or other changes in the intended project or any other determination that the proposed requirement is no longer needed, limitation or lack of available funds, circumstances that prevent determination of the best offer, or any other determination that rejection would be in the best interest of the Plan.

13. **INFORMATION AND DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE:** The Vendor shall furnish all information requested in the RFP document. Further, if required elsewhere in this bid, each Vendor shall submit with its bid any sketches, descriptive literature, and/or complete specifications covering the goods and services offered. Reference to literature submitted with a previous bid or available elsewhere will not satisfy this provision. Do not submit bid samples or descriptive literature unless expressly requested. Unsolicited bid samples or descriptive literature will not be examined or tested, will not be used to determine Responsiveness, and will not be deemed to vary any of the provisions of the RFP. Failure to comply with these requirements shall constitute sufficient cause to reject a bid without further consideration.

14. **WITHDRAWAL OF BID OR PROPOSAL:** Proposals submitted electronically may be withdrawn at any time prior to the date for bid opening identified on the cover page of this RFP document (or such later date included in an Addendum). Proposals that have been delivered by hand, U.S. Postal Service, courier, or other delivery service may be withdrawn only in writing and if receipt is acknowledged by the Plan prior to the time for opening identified on the cover page of the RFP document (or such later date included in an Addendum). Written withdrawal requests shall be submitted on the Vendor's letterhead and signed by an official of the Vendor authorized to make such request. Any withdrawal request made after bid opening shall be allowed only for good cause shown and in the sole discretion of the Plan.

15. **COST FOR BID OR PROPOSAL PREPARATION:** Any costs incurred by the Vendor in preparing or submitting Proposals are the Vendor's sole responsibility.

16. **INSPECTION AT VENDOR’S SITE:** The Plan reserves the right to inspect, at a reasonable time, the equipment, item, plant, or other facilities of a prospective Vendor prior to Contract award, and during the Contract term as necessary for the Plan's determination that such equipment, item, plant, or other facilities conform with the specifications/requirements and are adequate and suitable for the proper and effective performance of the Contract.

17. **CERTIFICATE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN NORTH CAROLINA:** As a condition of Contract award, each Vendor that is a corporation, limited-liability company, or limited-liability partnership shall have received, and shall maintain throughout the term of the Contract, a Certificate of Authority to Transact Business in North Carolina from the North Carolina Secretary of State, as required by North Carolina law.

18. **SUSTAINABILITY:** To support the sustainability efforts of the State of North Carolina we solicit Your cooperation in this effort. Pursuant to Executive Order 156 (1999), it is desirable that all responses meet the following:

a) If paper copies are requested, all copies of the bid are printed double sided. All submittals and copies are printed on recycled paper with a minimum post-consumer content of 30%.

b) Unless absolutely necessary, all bids and copies should minimize or eliminate use of non-recyclable or non-reusable materials such as plastic report covers, plastic dividers, vinyl sleeves, and GBC binding. Three-ringed binders, glued materials, paper clips, and staples are acceptable.

c) Materials should be submitted in a format which allows for easy removal, filing and/or recycling of paper and binder materials. Use of oversized paper is strongly discouraged unless necessary for clarity or legibility.

19. **RECIPROCAL PREFERENCE:** G.S. 143-59 establishes a reciprocal preference requirement to discourage other states from favoring their own resident Vendors by applying a percentage increase to the price of any bid from a North Carolina resident Vendor. To the extent another state does so, North Carolina applies the same percentage increase to the bid of a Vendor resident in that state. Residency is determined by a Vendor's "Principal Place of Business," defined as that principal place from which the overall trade or business of the Vendor is directed or managed.

22. **VENDOR REGISTRATION AND SOLICITATION NOTIFICATION SYSTEM:** The North Carolina electronic Vendor Portal ("eVP") allows Vendors to electronically register free with the State to receive electronic notification of current procurement opportunities available as well as notifications of status changes to those Solicitations. Online registration and other purchasing information is available at the following website: https://evp.nc.gov.

The status of a Vendor's E-Procurement Services account(s) shall be considered a relevant factor in determining whether to approve the award of a Contract resulting from this RFP document.

24. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:** To the extent permitted by applicable statutes and rules, the Plan will maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets that are submitted as part of each Vendor's Proposal. However, the Plan is subject to the Public Records Act, N.C.G.S. § 132.1, et seq. Vendor information that cannot be shown to be, e.g., a trade secret, may be subject to public disclosure under the terms of the Public Records Act. Blanket assertions of confidentiality are not favored, but confidentiality of specific material meeting one or more exceptions in the Public Records Act will be honored.

As a condition to confidential treatment of any documents submitted during the term of this Contract, each page containing trade secret information shall be identified in boldface at the top and bottom as "CONFIDENTIAL" by Vendor, with specific trade secret information enclosed in boxes, marked in a distinctive color, or identified by similar indication. Cost information shall not be deemed confidential under any circumstances. Regardless of what a Vendor may label as a trade secret, the determination whether it is or is not entitled to protection will be made in accordance with N.C.G.S. § 132-1.2. Any material labeled confidential constitutes a representation by the Vendor that it has made a reasonable effort in good faith to determine that such material is, in fact, a trade secret under N.C.G.S. § 132-1.2. Vendors are urged to limit the marking of information as a trade secret or as confidential so far as is possible. If a legal action is brought to require the disclosure of any material so marked confidential, it is the Vendor's responsibility to defend the confidential status of its information; the Plan will notify the Vendor of such action and not oppose the Vendor's effort to defend its information. When redacting portions of the Proposal as permitted by other sections of this RFP, all redactions shall be made in **BLACK** so that the redactions are easily identifiable by the Plan.

25. **COMMUNICATIONS BY VENDORS:** In submitting its bid, the Vendor agrees not to discuss or otherwise reveal the contents of its bid to any source, government or private, outside of the Plan until after the award of the Contract or cancellation of this RFP. All Vendors are forbidden from having any communications with the Plan, or any other representative of the Plan concerning the RFP, during the evaluation of the bids (i.e., after the public opening of the bids and before the award of the Contract), unless the Plan directly contacts the Vendor(s) for purposes of seeking Clarification or another reason permitted by the RFP. A Vendor shall not: (a) transmit to the Plan any information commenting on the ability or qualifications of any other Vendor to provide the advertised good, equipment, or commodity; (b) identify defects, errors and/or omissions in any other Vendor's bid and/or prices at any time during the procurement process; and/or (c) engage in or attempt any other communication or conduct that could influence the evaluation or award of a Contract related to this RFP. Failure to comply with this requirement shall constitute sufficient justification to disqualify a Vendor from a Contract award. Only those communications with the Plan which authorized by this RFP are permitted.

26. **INFORMAL COMMENTS:** The Plan shall not be bound by informal explanations, instructions or information given at any time by anyone on behalf of the Plan during the competitive process or after award. The Plan is bound only by information provided in writing in this RFP document and in formal Addenda.

27. **PROTEST PROCEDURES:** To protest a contract award, the Vendor shall submit a written request for a protest meeting addressed to: Executive Administrator, North Carolina State Health Plan, 3200 Atlantic Avenue, Raleigh, NC 27604. The request must be received by the Plan within fifteen calendar days from the date of Contract award. The written request shall contain specific reasons for the protest, including a fulsome explanation of those reasons that permits the Plan to properly evaluate the request, and any documentation necessary to support the protest. If the request does not contain this information or if the Executive Administrator determines that a meeting would serve no purpose, then the Executive Administrator may, within thirty (30) State Business Days from the date of receipt of the request, respond in writing to the Vendor and deny the request for a protest meeting.

If the request for a protest meeting is granted, the Executive Administrator will attempt to schedule the meeting within thirty (30) State Business Days after receipt of the Vendor's written request, or as soon as reasonably possible after receipt. Within ten (10) State Business Days from the date of the protest meeting, the Executive Administrator will respond to the Vendor in writing with the Executive Administrator's decision regarding the Vendor's protest of the Contract award.

Inclusion of this protest procedure is not intended to, and does not, waive, the Plan's exemption from Article 3 of Chapter 143 of the North Carolina General Statutes or any rules promulgated thereunder.

28. **ORDER OF PRECEDENCE:** In cases of conflict between specific provisions in this RFP or those in any resulting Contract documents, the order of precedence shall be (high to low) (1) any special terms and conditions specific to this RFP document, including any negotiated terms, (2) requirements and specifications and administration, (3) General Terms and Conditions, (4) Instructions To Vendors, (5) Pricing, and (6) Vendor's Bid.

29. **ADDENDA:** Critical updated information may be included in Addenda to the RFP. It is important that all Vendors bidding on the RFP periodically check for any Addenda that may be issued prior to the bid opening date. All Vendors shall be deemed to have read and understood all information in the RFP document and all Addenda thereto. The Vendors are also responsible for obtaining and complying with all Addenda and other changes that may be issued concerning the RFP.

30. **ORAL EXPLANATIONS NON-BINDING:** Oral explanations or instructions will not be binding. Any information given to a prospective Vendor concerning a RFP will be furnished promptly to all other prospective Vendors as an Addendum to the RFP, if that information is necessary for submitting Proposals or if the lack of it would be prejudicial to other prospective Vendors. See clause herein entitled "Duty to Inquire." The Plan will not identify You in its answer to Your question.

31. **MAXIMUM COMPETITION:** The Plan seeks to permit the maximum practicable competition. The Vendors are urged to advise the Plan, as soon as possible, regarding any aspect of this procurement, including any aspect of the RFP that unnecessarily or inappropriately limits full and open competition. If the Plan determines that any changes will be made resulting from the questions asked, then such decisions will be communicated in the form of an Addendum.

32. **FIRM PROPOSAL:** The Vendor's bid shall constitute a firm offer. By execution and delivery of a bid in response to a RFP, the Vendor agrees that any additional or modified terms and conditions, whether submitted purposefully or inadvertently, shall have no force or effect, and will be disregarded. Any bid that contains language that indicates the bid is non-binding or subject to further negotiation before a contractual document may be signed shall be rejected.

Vendor:

procurement card, if the Vendor accepts that card (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) from other customers, and it shall be accepted by the Vendor for payment under the same terms and conditions as any other method of payment accepted by the Vendor.

The Plan does not agree in advance, in contract, pursuant to Constitutional limitations, to pay costs such as interest, late fees, penalties or attorney's fees. This Contract will not be construed as an agreement by the State to pay such costs and will be paid only as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

**10. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WARRANTY AND INDEMNITY:** The Vendor shall hold and save the Plan, its officers, agents and employees, harmless from liability of any kind, including costs and expenses, resulting from infringement of the rights of any third party in any Services or copyrighted material, patented or patent-pending invention, article, device or appliance delivered in connection with the Contract.

a) The Vendor warrants to the best of its knowledge that:

1. Performance under the Contract does not infringe upon any intellectual property rights of any third party; and
2. There are no actual or threatened actions arising from, or alleged under, any intellectual property rights of any third party.

b) Should any Deliverables supplied by the Vendor become the subject of a claim of infringement of a patent, copyright, trademark or a trade secret in the United States, the Vendor, shall at its option and expense, either procure for the Plan the right to continue using the Deliverables, or replace or modify the same to become non-infringing. If neither of these options can reasonably be taken in the Vendor's judgment, or if further use shall be prevented by injunction, the Vendor agrees to cease provision of any affected Deliverables and refund any sums the Plan has paid the Vendor for such Deliverables and make every reasonable effort to assist the Plan in procuring substitute Deliverables. If, in the sole opinion of the Plan, the cessation of use by the Plan of any such Deliverables due to infringement issues makes the retention of other items acquired from the Vendor under this Agreement impractical, the Plan shall then have the option of terminating the Agreement, or applicable portions thereof, without penalty or termination charge; and the Vendor agrees to refund any sums the Plan paid for unused Services or other Deliverables.

c) The Vendor, at its own expense, shall defend any action brought against the Plan to the extent that such action is based upon a claim that the Deliverables supplied by the Vendor, their use or operation, infringe on a patent, copyright, trademark or violate a trade secret in the United States. The Vendor shall pay those costs and damages finally awarded or agreed in a settlement against the Plan in any such action. Such defense and payment shall be conditioned on the following:

1. That the Vendor shall be notified within a reasonable time in writing by the Plan of any such claim; and
2. That the Vendor shall have the sole control of the defense of an action on such claim and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise provided, however, that the Plan shall have the option to participate in such action at its own expense.

d) The Vendor will not be required to defend or indemnify the Plan to the extent any claim by a third party against the Plan for infringement or misappropriation results solely from the Plan's material alteration of any Vendor-branded Deliverables or Services, or from the continued use of the Services or other Deliverables after receiving written notice from the Vendor of the claimed infringement.

**11. ADVERTISING:** The Vendor agrees not to use the existence of the Contract, the name of the State of North Carolina, or the name of the Plan as part of any commercial advertising or marketing of Products or Services except as provided in 01 NCAC 05B.1516.

2. Compel attendance of any officer or employee of any non-State entity receiving money from either the Plan or another State entity in connection with this Contract, provided the officer or employee is responsible for implementing a program or providing a service paid for with money from either the Plan or another State entity in connection with this Contract.

a) Forward the Vendor's payment check directly to any person or entity designated by the Vendor; and
b) Include any person or entity designated by the Vendor as a joint payee on the Vendor's payment check.

In no event shall such approval and action obligate the Plan to anyone other than the Vendor and the Vendor shall remain responsible for fulfillment of all Contract obligations. Upon advance written request, the Plan may, in its unfettered discretion, approve an assignment to the surviving entity of a merger, acquisition or corporate reorganization, if made as part of the transfer of all or substantially all of the Vendor's assets.

**26. SEVERABILITY:** It is the intent of the Parties that the provisions of this Contract shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. To the extent that the terms set forth in this Contract or any word, phrase, clause, or sentence is found to be illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such word, phrase, clause or sentence shall be modified, deleted, or interpreted in such a manner so as to afford the Party for whose benefit it was intended the fullest benefit commensurate with making this Contract, as modified, enforceable, and the balance of this Contract shall not be affected thereby, the balance being construed as severable and independent from the illegal or unenforceable provision.

**27. RECORD RETENTION:** The Vendor shall retain all records for a minimum of six years following completion or termination of the Contract; however, if any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, disallowance action, or other action involving this Contract has begun before expiration of the six year retention period described above, the records must be retained until completion of the action and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of the regular six year period described above, whichever is later. Certain records, such as those subject to HIPAA, may have longer retention periods or require destruction sooner; therefore, any such records shall be maintained, destroyed, or disposed of in accordance with applicable law or regulation.

**28. FALSE CLAIMS ACT:** As an agency of the State, Vendors who receive payment from the Plan are subject to the North Carolina False Claims Act, N.C.G.S. § 1-607, et seq. Vendors who knowingly submit false claims or intentionally misrepresent information in order to receive funds from the Plan may be liable under the North Carolina False Claims Act. If it comes to the Plan's attention that a Vendor may have violated the North Carolina False Claims Act to obtain funds from the Plan, the Plan will refer the matter to the North Carolina Department of Justice for investigation and appropriate resolution, including prosecution if necessary to recover any funds wrongly received. The Vendor agrees that by entering this Agreement and receiving payment from the Plan, it is subject to and will comply with the North Carolina False Claims Act. The Vendor also agrees that it will comply with any Civil Investigative Demands properly issued by the Attorney General under N.C.G.S. § 1-614 to investigate any potential violations of the North Carolina False Claims Act.

### ATTACHMENT H: HIPAA QUESTIONNAIRE

As a covered entity, it is the responsibility of the North Carolina State Health Plan (“Plan”) to ensure its Members' health information is protected from uses and disclosures not allowed under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as well as applicable state and federal laws. The Plan takes this responsibility very seriously.

The purpose of this HIPAA Questionnaire is to allow the Plan to evaluate the HIPAA compliance of a prospective or current vendor who may request or require Member data containing Protected Health Information (“PHI”). As a threshold to being considered to do business with the Plan, the Vendor must demonstrate that it meets the Plan's expectations for HIPAA compliance. The information provided below will be used by the Plan to determine the Vendor's level of understanding of HIPAA privacy and security rules, as well as its compliance status.

The Vendor is encouraged to thoroughly respond to all questions to the best of its ability and provide copies of all requested documentation. The Plan encourages the Vendor to have its privacy officer or other compliance specialist complete this questionnaire. Any incomplete responses may negatively impact the Plan's evaluation of the Vendor's HIPAA compliance, including a determination that the Vendor does not meet the Plan's expectations.

All responses must be typed. Handwritten responses will not be accepted.

If the Vendor maintains that any information contained in requested documentation is proprietary or otherwise confidential, the Vendor may redact these portions and supply the un-Redacted portions for review.

### ATTACHMENT I: BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT

This Business Associate Agreement (“BAA”) is entered into between the North Carolina State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees (“Plan”), a division and Covered Healthcare Component of the North Carolina Department of State Treasurer (“DST”), and **[INSERT NAME OF ENTITY]** (hereinafter “Contractor”), individually referred to as a “Party” or collectively as the “Parties.” This BAA is effective when signed by the Parties and, except as otherwise required, shall remain in effect for the term of the Contract, including any extensions or renewals.

#### BACKGROUND

Sections 261 through 264 of the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, known as “the Administrative Simplification provisions,” direct the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) to develop standards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of health information. The “Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health” (“HITECH”) Act (Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5)) amended the Administrative Simplification provisions. Pursuant to the Administrative Simplification provisions, the Secretary of DHHS (“Secretary") issued regulations codified at 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164 (the “HIPAA Rules”), which were further amended by the Omnibus Final Rule (78 Fed. Reg. 5566) (hereinafter, the Administrative Simplification provisions, HITECH, such rules, amendments, and modifications, including any that are subsequently adopted, will be collectively referred to as “HIPAA”).

The Plan, a division of DST, is a health benefit plan which, standing alone, would be a covered entity under HIPAA. DST also includes several other divisions that do not qualify as covered entities and whose functions are not regulated by HIPAA; therefore, DST has designated itself as a “Hybrid Entity.” The Parties wish to enter into an agreement through which Contractor will provide certain services and/or Products to the Plan. The Parties believe that pursuant to that agreement, the relationship between Contractor and the Plan is such that Contractor is or may be a Business Associate as defined by the HIPAA Rules.

The Parties therefore enter this BAA to protect Plan Member information in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. The Parties enter into this BAA with the intent to comply with HIPAA provisions that allow: 1) a Covered Healthcare Component of a Hybrid Entity (the Plan) to disclose Protected Health Information ("PHI”) to a Business Associate; and 2) a Business Associate (i.e., Contractor) to create, maintain, transmit, or receive PHI on behalf of the Plan after the Plan obtains satisfactory assurances that Contractor will appropriately safeguard the information.

The Parties agree as follows:

## Proposal Number: 270-20250407DAS

Vendor:

**I. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

A. **Definitions:** Except as otherwise defined herein, any and all capitalized terms or abbreviations of capitalized terms in this BAA shall have the definitions set forth by HIPAA. In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of this BAA and mandatory provisions of HIPAA, HIPAA shall control. Where provisions of this BAA are different from those mandated by HIPAA, but are nonetheless permitted by HIPAA, the provisions of this BAA shall control.

B. **Ambiguous Terms:** In case of ambiguous, inconsistent, or conflicting terms within this BAA, such terms shall be resolved to allow for compliance with HIPAA.

C. **Application of Civil and Criminal Penalties:** Contractor acknowledges that it is subject to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d-5 and 1320d-6 in the same manner as such sections apply to a Hybrid Entity, to the extent that Contractor violates §§ 13401(a), 13404(a), or 13404(b) of the HITECH Act and 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(e) and 164.504(e). Furthermore, Contractor is liable for the acts of its own Business Associates under 45 C.F.R. § 160.402(c), who are considered Subcontractors when they have access to Plan PHI.

D. **Assignment:** Contractor shall not assign or transfer any right or interest in this BAA. Any attempt by Contractor to assign or transfer any right or interest in this BAA is void and has no effect.

E. **Forum:** The laws of the State of North Carolina shall govern this BAA and any and all interpretations of this BAA. The venue for any claim, demand, suit, or cause of action shall be in the state and federal courts located in North Carolina.

F. **Hybrid Entity:** HIPAA defines a Hybrid Entity as one that uses or discloses PHI for only a part of its business operations. DST has taken the designation of a Hybrid Entity because it includes the Plan as a division. In addition to the Plan, the Covered Health Components of DST include: the Office of State Treasurer; the Information Technology Division; and the Financial Operations Division.

G. **Indemnification:** Any Breaches of HIPAA or this BAA shall be subject to the indemnification clause found in the "General Terms and Conditions" of the Contract.

H. **Regulatory References:** Any reference in this BAA to a federal or state statute or regulation (whether specifically or generally) means that statute or regulation which is in effect on the date of any action or inaction relating to the BAA section which refers to such statute or regulation.

I. **Stricken Provisions:** In the event any portion of this BAA is determined by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that portion alone will be deemed void, and the remainder of the BAA will continue in full force and effect.

J. **Termination of BAA:** Except as otherwise provided below, either Party shall have the right to terminate the Contract if either Party determines that the other Party has violated any material term of this BAA. Upon either Party's belief of a material breach of this BAA by the other Party, the non-breaching Party:

1. Shall give written notice of its belief that a material breach has occurred within a reasonable time after forming that belief. The non-breaching Party shall provide a reasonable opportunity for the

Vendor:

breaching Party to cure the breach or end the violation and, if the breaching Party does not cure the breach or end the violation within the time specified by the non-breaching Party, the non-breaching Party may exercise such rights as are specified in the Contract; or

2. May immediately exercise such rights as are specified in the Contract if the breaching Party has breached a material term of this BAA and cure is not possible; or

3. Shall report the violation to the Secretary of DHHS if neither termination nor cure is possible. The Plan shall abide by federal reporting regulations.

**II. OBLIGATIONS AND ACTIVITIES OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATE**

A. Contractor acknowledges and agrees that all PHI created, maintained, transmitted, received, or used by Contractor in relation to the Contract shall be subject to this BAA. This obligation to protect Plan Member privacy and to keep such PHI confidential survives the termination, cancellation, expiration, or other conclusion of the BAA as set forth below.

B. Contractor agrees it is aware of and will comply with all provisions of HIPAA that are directly applicable to Business Associates.

C. Contractor shall use or disclose any PHI solely as would be permitted by HIPAA if such use or disclosure were made by Covered Entity: (1) for meeting its obligations as set forth in the Contract, or any other agreements between the Parties evidencing their business relationship; or (2) as required by applicable law, rule or regulation, or by accrediting or credentialing organization to whom Covered Entity is required to disclose such information or as otherwise permitted under this BAA, the Contract (if consistent with this BAA and HIPAA), or HIPAA. All such uses and disclosures shall be subject to the limits set forth in 45 CFR § 164.514 regarding limited data sets and 45 CFR § 164.502(b) regarding the minimum necessary requirements.

D. Contractor shall develop, document, implement, maintain, and use appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI, and to protect the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of that PHI. The safeguards that Contractor implements shall meet the requirements set forth by DHHS including, but not limited to, any requirements set forth in HIPAA and North Carolina state law as applicable.

E. Contractor shall implement security policies and procedures and provide the Plan's HIPAA Privacy Officer ("PO") with a copy of such.

F. Contractor agrees that if it enters into an agreement with any agent or Subcontractor, under which PHI could or would be disclosed or made available to the agent or Subcontractor, Contractor shall have an appropriate BAA that conforms to applicable law and is consistent with this BAA.

H. If Contractor provides PHI created, maintained, transmitted, or received by the Plan to any agent or Subcontractor, the agent or Subcontractor shall agree that with respect to such information, the same or greater restrictions and conditions that apply through this BAA to Contractor shall also apply to the agent or Subcontractor.

I. Contractor shall obtain and document “satisfactory assurances” of any agent or Subcontractor to whom it provides PHI on behalf of the Plan through a written contract or other agreement with Contractor that meets the requirements of 45 C.F.R. § 164.504(e).

J. Contractor agrees that if and to the extent it conducts in whole or part Standard Transactions on behalf of the Plan, Contractor shall comply, and shall require any and all agents or Subcontractors involved with the conduct of such Standard Transactions to comply, with each applicable requirement of 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 162 and the HITECH Act as if they were the Plan.

This paragraph applies only to the PHI that is in Contractor's care, custody, or control.

N. Contractor shall provide the Plan with copies of all policies, procedures, and practices related to the use and disclosure of Plan PHI prior to or upon execution of this BAA.

**III. BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**

A. Upon discovery by Contractor of a suspected or actual Breach of Unsecured PHI, Contractor must notify the Plan's PO, in writing, within three business days. For purposes of this section, “discovery” means having obtained knowledge in any manner from any source and in any form, including from an agent or Subcontractor. This notice does not need to be a final report but must inform the Plan's PO of an approximate number of individuals affected by the Breach, whether there is an ongoing risk of improper disclosure, and what steps are being taken to mitigate the Breach and/or ongoing risk of disclosure. See "Exhibit A" for the contact information for the Plan's PO.

B. Contractor is not required to report Unsuccessful Security Incidents. For purposes of this BAA, an "Unsuccessful Security Incident” is defined as a ping or other broadcast attack on Contractor's firewall, a port scan, an unsuccessful log-on attempt, a denial of service attack, and any combination of the above, as long as no such incident results in unauthorized access, acquisition, use, or disclosure of PHI.

C. Upon discovery of an acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI not authorized by the HIPAA Rules, Contractor shall conduct any risk assessment necessary to determine whether such acquisition, access, use, or disclosure was a Breach and whether notification is required. Contractor will maintain any related records in accordance with Contractor's internal policies and procedures and the applicable provisions of the Breach Notification Rule as interpreted by Contractor. The risk assessment must consider the nature and extent of the PHI involved, including the types of identifiers and the likelihood of re-identification; the unauthorized person who used the PHI or to whom the disclosure was made; whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed; and the extent to which the risk to the PHI has been mitigated. The risk assessment must be thorough, conducted in good faith, and reach a reasonable conclusion. Contractor shall provide the Plan with a final signed copy of the risk assessment or report within three business days of its completion, no later than ten business days after discovery of the unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure (unless otherwise agreed to by the Plan's PO).

D. Contractor shall mitigate, to the extent practicable, any harmful effect that is known to Contractor of a use or disclosure of PHI by Contractor in violation of the requirements of this BAA or HIPAA.

E. Contractor shall submit a formal report to the Plan's PO without unreasonable delay, but no later than ten business days after discovery. The formal report shall include, to the extent possible, the following:

1. A brief description of what happened (identify the nature of the non-permitted use or disclosure), including the date of the Breach, the date of the discovery of the Breach, and the date the Breach was reported to the Contractor's Privacy Officer;

2. A description of the nature of the Unsecured PHI that was involved in the Breach (e.g., Plan Member's full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, etc.);

3. Identify who made the non-permitted use or disclosure;

4. Identify the recipient(s) of the non-permitted use or disclosure;

6. A description of what Contractor did or will do to mitigate risks, harmful effects, and losses of the non-permitted use or disclosure;

7. Identify what corrective action Contractor took or will take to prevent and protect against further Breaches;

8. Identify the steps Plan Members should take to protect themselves from potential harm resulting from the Breach;

9. Contact procedures for Plan Members to ask questions of or learn additional information from the Contractor, which shall include a toll-free telephone number, e-mail address, Web site, or postal address; and

10. Provide such other information related to the Breach as the Plan may reasonably request.

F. If Contractor determines that a Breach of Unsecured PHI has occurred, Contractor shall provide written notice, on behalf of the Plan, without unreasonable delay, but no later than thirty calendar days following the date the Breach of Unsecured PHI is or reasonably should have been discovered by Contractor, or such later date as is authorized under 45 C.F.R. § 164.412, to:

1. each individual whose Unsecured PHI has been, or is reasonably believed by Contractor to have been, accessed, acquired, used, or disclosed as a result of the Breach;
2. the media, to the extent required under 45 C.F.R. § 164.406; and
3. the Secretary, to the extent required under 45 C.F.R. § 164.408.

G. Contractor shall send notices to individuals using the last known address of the individual on file with Contractor unless the individual has agreed to electronic notice as set forth in 45 C.F.R. § 164.404. If the notice to any individual is returned as undeliverable, Contractor shall alert the Plan, and take such action as is required by the Breach Notification Rule.

H. Contractor shall be responsible for the drafting, content, form, and method of delivery of each of the notices required to be provided by Contractor under this section. Contractor shall comply, in all respects, with 45 C.F.R. § 164.404 and any other applicable notification provisions of the Breach Notification Rule, including without limitation 45 C.F.R. Part 164 Subpart D, Section 13402 of the HITECH Act, and applicable state law, as interpreted by Contractor.

I. Contractor's notices must be reviewed and approved by the Plan's PO before being sent to Plan Members, published to the media, or otherwise made public to any person or entity that is not a Party to this BAA.

J. Any notices required to be delivered by Contractor shall be at the expense of Contractor.

K. Contractor shall provide to the Plan or an individual, in the reasonable time and manner requested by the PO, information collected in accordance with Section III of this BAA, to permit the Plan to respond
