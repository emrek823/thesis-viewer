# Technology / Product

*   Historically, we see that most healthcare service operators build ‘outside in', that is, they develop the operational framework to replicate existing service providers builds and over time develop their own proprietary, tailored tech stack (often a mix of buy & build) to serve their specific company operational needs (typically this tech stack would not transfer seamlessly outside of the specific business). However, another way to consider tech as a means to drive operational leverage in service operations is to begin 'Inside Out' where you begin first building the underlying Pela tech stack first (hub) that directly informs nearly every element of your clinical and admin functionality (spokes) vs the other way around. We are keen to more deeply understand how you think about this at Pela.
    *   I think there is a balance between these two approaches in our strategy. Since we are already having some vendor conversations and seeing interest in that space, having an outstanding technical infrastructure lets us enter high margin verticals relatively quickly. More importantly however, an improved tech platform drives clinical efficiency, improves clinical platform adoption for stakeholders that influence patient decision making, and provides the basis for a replicable sales playbook in this space. However, I do not think that the technology should limit growth for a clinical services organization. Using existing service providers to begin will allow us to move quickly through the existing ALF market and capture patient lives now, which is fundamentally the primary source of income for us in the next few years.
*   Do you have a demo to show the current product? Any images/information describing a product roadmap over the next 12-18 months?
    *   We can walk through a demo together (need to be cognizant of HIPAA).
    *   Attaching some rough screenshots of our ideal next release.

*   Can you walk us through your build vs. buy decision-making framework? What is a must-have for you to build? What is strategic to buy? How will this change over time?
    *   I like to think about two components of our service model: clinical outcomes and social integration. In my roadmap, features around social integration are important achieving scale quickly and require fewer external resources to get started (e.g., chat features, family portal access, integration with facility events, etc.). On the other hand, clinical tools are harder to build (especially ones with deep analytics and predictive capabilities) because of regulatory requirements and data needs to build good models. For social integration, it makes more sense to build things quickly especially when there are no existing solutions or solutions within the facility's toolbox already to drive empanelment and keep stakeholders engaged. Features like chat rooms and video integrations are easy to design with customizable, off-the-shelf solutions (e.g., PubNub). At the beginning, clinical tools (data aggregation like Particle Health, ADT alerts like PatientPing/Bamboo, etc.) make more sense to buy + build easy features like incident reporting (e.g., wounds, falls, etc.) for tracking patient outcomes. That being said, as we have a larger data repository over time, we should be moving towards building the analytics infrastructure underneath a value-based care platform (e.g., care gaps tracking and nudges, predictive analytics on patient acute events, etc.).
*   Regarding other software in ALFs today (e.g., MatrixCare/PointClickCare, Caremerge/Sagely, Caring Data, Bamboo Health, August Health, etc) - how do you think about replacing or integrating (if at all) with any of these tools?
    *   For clinical tools that are already in use at non-SNF facilities (which is very rare), it is easier to integrate with tools (PCK/Matrix + Bamboo) rather than rip out their workflow. For social tools like August, Sagely, etc., it won't make sense to replace this at the beginning, especially because we are not managing all of the social activities that the facility does (e.g., church outings, salon visits, etc.).
*   Can you elaborate on the facility and family software tools? What are the key pieces of functionality that will drive value for facilities and families (must-have vs. nice-to-have)?
    *   Must-have: view patient medical record, track clinical updates easily, chat/video engagement with providers
    *   Nice-to-have: integrated medication administration, online PDF/form submission workflows, integrated payment suite, access to wearables data
*   What is the current software other providers are using in the facility and otherwise (Pela office, home, etc)? You mentioned you've developed ways to auto-generate ICD-10/CPT codes for billing/quality and integrating clinical/claims data. What are next 2-3 priority items?
    *   There is very limited software in use in the facility – we have one facility using Sagely to coordinate activities and many, if not all, have some form of an electronic medication administration record. Facilities with skilled nursing components also use EHRs (eg American Health Tech, MatrixCare, PCK). Some clinics are using a type of RPM/CCM software (eg DocsInk) but few work well in a highly geriatric/quasi-institutional population. The next three items on the roadmap for me are 1) intelligent scheduling/task management between facilities, patients/families, and our clinical staff; 2) a condition-specific PRO + observational data workflow; and 3) an integrated communications platform to facilitate engagement between the facility + clinical staff + families.
*   How do you define “meaningful progress” for predictive algorithms around fall-detection? You mentioned comparing PPG and accelerometer data with facility incident reports. Is this sufficient to provide meaningful data to allow providers to take meaningful next-steps and provide an intervention to close the loop? What do you want to prioritize next (UTI, strokes, etc) and why?
    *   Most of these facilities are doing some sort of incident reporting as required by state law. My goal is to take the clinical + sensor data we gather and create supervised learning algorithms based on the incident reporting data (ie start with retrospective analysis and then move towards prospective studies). Detection alone will not prevent the first fall but can be instrumental in preventing future falls since fall history is one of the most predictive variables for future falls + can alert us of potential deteriorations in clinical status that can cause other health issues (eg hypotension). Prediction is the ultimate goal but will be harder to achieve - the goal is to use the working detection algorithms to build a reinforcement learning model to start predicting falls before they occur. A really good model would have AUC value > .75 which is better than three common existing fall risk models ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3212865/)).
    *   The next events to think about are likely UTIs. They have a prevalence range from 0.6% to 21.8% and represents 30% to 50% of antibiotic use in LTC ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/longtermcare/infection-control/uti.html)). They are also avoidable sources of ED visits/hospitalizations that are increasing ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6449176/)).

# Why Now?

*   What are the specific trends and tailwinds (regulatory, cost/spend, demographic, public sentiment, etc.) that suggest now is the time to build Pela? We appreciate as much specificity, factual evidence and objective reasoning that you can provide.
    *   FFS reimbursement allows for companies to flex their care management muscles as they figure out the best route to transitioning to VBC. With the onset of CCM/RPM/BHI codes and the recent increases in its payment, Medicare is giving primary care startups like me, the opportunity to practice in a quasi-VBC environment without taking too much risk before reaching key milestones in product development, smooth clinical workflows, and scale. This allows companies to set themselves up for success as a pay-vider because they have breathing room at the 0 to 1 stage.
    *   New federal regulations (e.g., the Cures Act) for payers and EHR vendors have opened unprecedented opportunities to access clinical and claims data. Integrated data networks + passive monitoring data streams means better risk stratification, improved care coordination, and better communication opportunities between various stakeholders in clinical lifecycles.
    *   RCCs are starting to receive increasingly acute patients and more stringent medical regulation at the state level (sources elsewhere in this document). Ultimately, they are figuring out how to bring as many services on-site to lower their care management time and improve their marketing offers (this is based on multiple customer discovery conversations with ALF operators/leadership).

# Pilot Results

*   Can you describe the sales-cycle for these initial pilot customers (cold outreach, word of mouth, referrals, etc)? What was the timeline and process from initial conversation to treating the first patient?
    *   Our initial sales cycle was based on cold outreach asking the facility director if they have someone on-site and/or they are interested in having us come on-site to care for patients. Some facilities were faster (closed within a week) to a little longer (took a month to think about it). From there, we typically have our first night-based family meeting event and start talking about our services. From that night onwards, we typically have a few families convert to our care and can start treating patients as soon as the intake paperwork is completed.
*   Of the 10 ALF + 2 ILF sites, how many residents do each of these facilities have? What is the enrollment rate within each of these facilities (% of total residents, % of traditional medicare)? How did enrollment grow over time?
    *   I can tell you that the average bed count is 58 for the ALFs but can't find an easy way to get current occupancy rates (and therefore enrollment rates). I cannot find the current bed count for ILF but do know it is 100+ and typically has lower enrollment into our service since these patients have less acuity and can typically drive themselves to their existing providers. Enrollment does grow over time as we have more meetings with families and become familiar faces in a facility.
*   How many patients do you serve today? What are your conversion rates (%)?
    *   We have an active panel of 167 patients. We don't have a clear conversion rate since we don't know occupancy at each facility (it has been super low until now because of COVID + some of the facilities are still stabilizing as newer facilities).
*   Who are these patients (age, co-morbidities, income bracket, average monthly rent, etc)? Are they willing to switch PCPs or simply want urgent care? Do you have any data (NPS, etc) on how they perceive quality / access to care?
    *   Average monthly rent is between 3-5k. They are typically affluent and have supplemental insurance (and very few Duals patients in our current facilities). Patients are very sick (multiple chronic conditions and medications with a risk of 1.77) and very old (~84 average). We don't have hard data yet on care perception, but we know qualitatively that they are willing to switch PCPs if either a) their families are the ones who have to drive them to doc appts (meaning the family drives adoption), or b) their existing PCP is unable to respond quickly to urgent issues (eg UTI/fall) which drives future adoption to our full services primary care platform.
*   What services have you been billing for to generate the initial $140K in revenue (trends, overall volume, % breakdown)?
    *   The primary billing here is in E/M and H&P codes. As our software has been coming together, we have introduced more RPM + CCM + AWV + CCA billing and have an idea of how that billing and clinical workflow looks, but it's an overall small part of our billing right now (but the most rapidly growing piece).
*   For the one APRN, can you describe the average “day in the life” and clinical model? How many hours is he/she working day/week (weekday vs. weekends)? How often is he/she traveling between sites? What are the lessons (positives and negatives) you learned to inform your clinical model as you scale to 10-15 providers?
    *   Currently, our APRN handles most of her own work (eg charting, rounding on patients, ordering labs, etc.). She currently works ~8 hours/day on the weekdays and is occasionally on call during weekends (not super common). She travels between 2 facilities per day max and also spends some time in our office to work on charting, referrals, lab orders, etc. The important lessons that we have learned is that there is a lot of rote work that could be handled by a centralized office on behalf of the APRNs to improve efficiency + job satisfaction (eg let the central office manage the visit schedule, manage prior authorizations, etc.). Building this centralized workflow via internal task management is part of our next task along with connecting the central hub to the extenders in the field.
*   Can you expand on your conversations about licensing parts of your platform as SaaS to a PCP servicing 600+ nursing home patients, a 4 neurologist group for dementia care, three solo PCPs, 3 medium to large multi-PCP groups, and three champions at value-based care networks (one ACO and two CINs)?
    *   The non-VBC actors (eg PCP in NFs, neurologists, etc.) are interested in improving their FFS billing by bringing more preventive care codes into their repertoire. To that end, they have seen prototypes of the software and had interest in using this in practice. The conversations were around paying a PMPM fee for TCM/CCM/RPM services and a per seat fee for access to the AWV+CCA tracking/charting solution. For champions in VBC networks, they typically were part of less technologically sophisticated organizations (eg small regional ACO in mid-GA). To that end, they were interested in thinking about providing this tech to a) drive attribution in MSSP ACOs by doing more high impact primary care eligible services on their panels (eg 99483 + G0439), b) an integrated data system that nudges providers to identify diagnoses that impact risk adjustment, and c) an improved preventive care platform to track and close care gaps by tying these goals to financial incentives (eg get providers to think about preventive care more deeply by showing them money during an AWV).

# Market Data (Focused on 1. GA and 2. Other regions in South/Southeast if applicable)

*   How many ALFs are in this target market? What is the distribution of small/medium/large facilities by residents?
    *   Aggregating data across other states is not as easy (they use a lot of PDFs instead of excel), but I can give you a sense of GA's market pretty well. Looking at a subset of personal care homes and ALFs with 10 or more patients, there are 731 facilities with 37,937 beds. If we look only at this subset in counties with 300 or more beds, there are 476 facilities with 28,725 beds. In this 476 community subset, 84 facilities have 10-19 beds, 167 have 20-59, and 225 have 60 or more.
*   Do you have any metrics on the general health/growth of ALF real-estate market, including historical and potential future trends for: average/median occupancy rates? Price per unit/sq. ft.? Expense ratios? Cap rate? New construction / M&A?
    *   Traditionally, senior housing units have been profitable PE investments with strong growth. This dipped a little because of COVID but there is a big rebound occurring now. For stabilized homes, occupancy used to be around 90% but dipped to low 80s during COVID and 2021 Q2 showed a pickup in occupancy again ([source](https://www.nic.org/newsroom/articles/seniors-housing-occupancy-began-to-recover-in-q2-2021/)). Construction lending for ALF dev is also up: "banks lent more than $118 million [in Q2 2021], increases of ... 70% from the previous quarter” ([source](https://www.nic.org/newsroom/articles/nic-map-data-highlights-q2-2021/)). Attaching a screenshot regarding cap rate/expense ratios for senior living ([source](https://www.cbre.com/research-and-reports/SENIORS-HOUSING-ANNUAL-REPORT-2021-US)).

*   What are the trends that give you confidence that you are, as you described, 1-2 years early to this inflection point? It would be helpful to expand more on what you mentioned in the memo as well as any specific dynamics in the geographies of focus.
    *   From a market perspective, I think there are a few important signals. First, our direct competitor (Pine Park Health) has shown reasonable success in the CA market and large organizations like Optum and Dispatch Health are slowly considering health partnerships (albeit not in a direct primary care role) with ALFs. This is a pretty strong signal of increasing interest from both venture-backed startups and mature companies in the ALF market, especially with an eye towards VBC. Second, ALFs and RCCs more generally are becoming increasingly medicalized. A scoping review by the NCAL identifies this as the ongoing trend ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6449176/)) and academic experts are advocating strongly for on-site care ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6449176/)). In GA specifically, there is a stronger move towards having LPN training at minimum on site along with CE requirements for all staff - indicating a move towards medical care on-site. Fundamentally, as primary care moves towards VBC (especially for state sponsored payors), ALFs are low hanging fruit where patients are high acuity but treated similarly to community dwelling patients.

# Clinical Services at Scale

*   What is the breadth of services Pela hopes to offer at scale?
    *   In the long-term vision, we hope to offer multiple clinical services including: Traditional primary care management for chronic + acute conditions, preventive care services, pharmacist-assisted medication management, quick turnaround lab services (e.g., urine cultures, phlebotomy, etc.), on-site imaging (e.g., ultrasound, mobile x-ray), mobile IV services, optometry/dentistry, podiatry
*   What partnerships do you need for referral to other services (health systems, DME, pharmacy, etc)?
    *   Medication refills require long-term care pharmacy involvement
    *   Procedural visits (eg colonoscopy) require referrals to specialists/health systems
    *   Surgical procedures (eg lung biopsy, cardiac cath) require referrals
    *   DME will be sourced through existing DME companies
    *   More intensive imaging (eg MRI/CT) by surrounding diagnostic centers
*   How are you planning on hiring, retaining, and managing these providers as you grow? More on the tech to enable this below, but practically speaking, how do you think about effectively managing 10-15 providers in 3 cites 1.5 - 2 hrs apart?
    *   Hiring APRNs has been a pretty seamless experience for us. A nice thing about the South is that people in these communities know one another. For example, we have one chain we work with that wants us to see their 4 facilities' patients in Louisiana and is willing to introduce us to their APRNs in the area to see if anyone is willing to come work for us. Similarly, we have relationships with a few recruitment agencies that are really good at hiring providers in these areas. For collaborating physicians that provide chart review + clinical oversight, we are able to leverage companies like Arista + CollaboratingDocs to ensure we provide high quality care.
    *   The more important question here, in my opinion, is the management of a large volume of providers. First, we have to establish dedicated panels of facilities per provider. That means we don't deploy nurse practitioners to see patients on a PRN basis (similar to acute visits by Dispatch Health). This allows long standing relationships between providers and facilities and patients/families. Second, as we grow, we will also have regional medical directors assisted by a RN to keep tabs of provider service quality, how many visits they are completing, patient satisfaction, and tasks management. Also, because a lot of this data is going to be in our system (such as tasks), we can create provider-level and facility-level insights to compare how various providers operate in relation to others nearby. This allows us to have data-driven performance reviews on our providers/staff.

# Go-to Market (GTM) Strategy

*   Post-fundraise, can you walk us through your go-to-market (GTM) strategy? How do you build the top of the funnel? How will you manage new accounts, implementation, and expansion?
    *   This might change a little depending on who fills in this round (eg PE firms owning multiple ALFs). Assuming we don't have those people involved, our goal is to start by scaling into the chains we already work with (~100 facilities throughout the south, with the lion's share between AL/SC/GA). As we enter new markets with our existing relationships (who have already come through the top of the funnel), we will begin the outreach process to nearby facilities. As we get facilities to buy into the model, we start by hosting a family dinner or some event that brings in families/patients to learn about our services and how we can add value to their current care process. We can also begin gathering leads for people that might not switch immediately and do targeted campaigns to market our services over time + deliver urgent care as needed. The COO-esque role will be super helpful here to manage a lot of this work at the onset and build the playbook that his or her staff will use in new markets.
*   How do you think about customer segmentation and prioritization? For example, how do you balance lower revenue potential sales (with potentially shorter sales cycles) with higher revenue potential customers (longer sales cycles)? How do you leverage geographic density while remaining opportunistic to new customers?
    *   I think you start with lower revenue/shorter sales cycles (this means independent or small-to-medium facility chains) to start acquiring a panel and making money. The average dollars per patient should be the same, it is just a question of customer acquisition cost when you find different chain sizes (bigger chains = easier scale = lower CAC). This being said, we first should move towards areas with better ALF bed density (eg metro areas where we have connections like Atlanta, Columbus, and Savannah). However, in other areas that have open opportunities (for example, we are exploring partnerships with a few facilities in Albany, GA), it still makes sense to take revenue opps as long as it does not conflict with the overall goal of moving towards a true “platform”.
*   Are there any non-obvious market / GTM considerations for the Deep South that you are considering and/or could play to Pela's advantage?
    *   The major tailwind here is that the growth of elderly populations is substantially higher in the Sun Belt. For example, FL + GA + SC had 40% or more growth in the 65+ population ([source](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/age-and-sex/2020-age-sex-composition.html)). If you look at metro markets by region, the Southeast had ~23% of the total beds ([source](https://www.cbre.com/research-and-reports/SENIORS-HOUSING-ANNUAL-REPORT-2021-US)). Less tangibly though, there is also a cultural component to selling into Southern facilities that we can benefit from. The Southern culture is very aligned with in-person, at-home services. The older population here also responds to a prototypical “Southern charm”. Understanding this enables us to search for and train clinical talent consistent with patient expectations. Fundamentally, it is about being culturally competent, and who better than a team that has spent the majority of their lives in that context.

*   These community advocates seem to be an important part of your strategy. Can you elaborate? Who are these community advocates (background, ties to community, etc)? What is the interaction between these boots on the ground and other strategies?
    *   The community advocates are not necessarily people from the local community, but more of someone from the same region and similar background. For example, our advocates as we move towards Albany, GA do not need to live in Albany but do need to have a background or experience working with comparable communities (eg experience in Warner Robins/Macon/Columbus). Really the goal of these advocates will be to a) facilitate the outreach process to facilities, b) maintain good relationships with the facilities, c) facilitate in-community events (eg family meeting nights, biweekly Zoom calls, etc.) to drive empanelment, and d) proactively reach out to residents + families to convert them and/or keep them engaged with the care process. These advocates should be part of biweekly calls with the providers assigned to these communities to see how they can work together to a) improve facility/family/resident satisfaction, and b) ensure they are not crossing over anyone's toes.
*   What evidence or metrics unlocks your path to risk? What is the stepwise process of graduating from FFS to risk (e.g., shared-savings, then sub-capitation)? What is the patient threshold to move to shared savings or capitated models?
    *   The stepwise process in my head is to get from FFS + ACO rentals (0-5,000 patients) and then a mixture of subcapitation + opening our own payor organizations. Conversations with MSSP ACO leaders + people experienced in risk based contracting say that 5,000 patients is typically the panel threshold for unlocking shared savings contracts for various payers. There is no minimum threshold for opening a MA plan (e.g., C-SNP), but it would be best to have a strong presence in a market + understanding of risk tolerance before moving to that model. Other evidence that I am looking for is MLR at 600-800 patients, changes in RAF/HCC post-entry for a patient, and adoption of our services as we move into new markets.

# Financials

*   How many facility customers do you expect to have in order to enroll 800 patients?
    *   ~20 facilities
*   Do you expect to break-even in FFS model at maturity in a facility? Why / why not?
    *   Yes. I think about this less in the context of a facility but the unit economics around one APRN. This model outlines my thoughts on the FFS revenue (not including shared savings payments) at a very high level, but the key takeaway here is that COGS is less than 40% from my calculations on contribution margin and PMPY revenue can be ~$3,000.
*   How do you expect unit economics to compare to other primary care models (PMPY revenue, contribution margin, patient acquisition costs, retention, etc)? Why?
    *   Our unit economics are very attractive compared to traditional FFS outpatient clinics. We have higher cadence of visits (due to increased acuity) and much larger potential for cost savings in a shared savings program. As a result, PMPY revenue and CM is going to be better than traditional FFS. I also expect that margin as a percent of revenue is going to be competitive in this model with an OSH style model where they take less in capitation and more risk but still have to cover costs of clinical staff and de novo clinic creation. Moreover, our acquisition process is a lot faster than traditional, brick and mortar primary care since we work with "captive” populations and get to use a B2B sales route which is typically faster than the D2C approach primary care takes. I would argue our acquisition model is more comparable with One Medical than the traditional Medicare primary care cos since we sell into an organization first to drive patient acquisition. Retention for us is going to be inherently lower since these patients are sicker and more likely to die/move to SNF care within a 2-3 year period - an issue that PCPs with less acute patients will deal with. That being said, working with the facility can be a long-term relationship meaning more patients are acquired as occupancy grows and stabilizes for a facility.

# Team

*   Post-financing, what are the top 2-3 priority roles to be hired? You mentioned a COO-esque role as well as Head of Product — what specific qualifications & experiences do you require in these two (2) roles. Have you identified and/or engaged prospective candidates?
    *   COO/Head of Product are most important during this seed stage. The COO should have deep knowledge of either selling into LTC or scaling a clinical staff panel. Ideally, this will be someone at one of the facilities we currently work with or someone adjacent to this network. We have engaged with a few people meeting this criteria. The Head of Product should be comfortable with PM at an IC level and some technical experience so they can prototype components as needed. We are looking at some potential candidates here but still early in the recruiting process since I have experience doing this work.
*   As a young (and, impressive!) founder building in the PAC/ALF market how do you intend to engage and mobilize experienced industry leaders around Pela?
    *   In my experience, industry leaders are excited about young energy coming into a traditionally arcane/older space. I think getting these leaders to believe in the vision is crucial (ie a business centered around improving patient outcomes, focus on cost savings, and introduction of breakout technologies in a very underserved population). However, proper engagement does not mean disregarding their experience/learnings but rather figuring out where the best practices are in these conversations and applying them with humility and respect. Fundamentally, no one wants to work with an arrogant person, but – in my experience – they love working with someone scrappy, young, and respectful.
*   Are you currently working with any strategic advisors? What types of advisors do you believe you would benefit most from in the next 12-18 months?
    *   I do have a few (a past entrepreneur, a couple of people with experience in assisted living, and plenty of clinical advisors)! I think the ones who would be most useful going forward are those who have built 0 to 1 businesses in operationally intense verticals of healthcare, anyone with a strong regulatory/legislative background, and people with experience taking on risk-based contracts (eg ex-MSO executives, ACO leaders/operators, etc).

# Vision

*   We appreciate you sharing a snippet of your vision for Pela yesterday. It would be great if you can elaborate further. And, ultimately, what does success at Pela look like for you?
    *   Ultimately, I want to build a business that really thinks about whole person centered care in the RCC/PAC market. This means working through value based care payment models and aligning incentives with improved patient outcomes. This means bringing deep analytics to markets that still don't always have EHRs. This means building a primary care model for quasi- and fully-institutionalized patients that includes a cohesive social model of care, where providers really become part of the community fabric. I believe that pursuing these three virtues will build a responsible, sustainable, and profitable business.

# Use of funds / Series A goals (diving deeper from slide)

*   What is your ideal syndicate? Are there specific skill sets, experiences, phenotypes, etc., that you want to partner with at this stage of the business?
    *   This is pretty similar to the types of advisors I want to work with. I want to find a syndicate with experience building digital health products, building analytics solutions for VBC, patient acquisition experts, and regulatory/compliance experience. I also want to bring on investors that can help me position myself for a successful Series A round, think about recruiting healthcare-oriented/adjacent team members, and connect me to the right people in the VBC world in the future.
*   More specifically, how would you define “meaningful improvements” in RAF/patient outcomes, quality metrics, and unit economics?
    *   Meaningful improvements in RAF would be to have a statistically significant change in RAF before and after we enter a patient panel. There are a few statistical methods for this (ie diff-in-diff, t-tests, etc.) that we can lean on. Methods for tracking and measuring meaningful improvements in quality metrics would be similar to the above but also looking at our quality metrics in comparison to industry standards (eg how do we compare to Optum I-SNP plans or LTC ACO metrics?) with similar statistical tests.
    *   In terms of unit economics, I am less interested in “meaningful improvements” and more interested in proving this model can be profitable at maturity and understanding the minimum capitation payment needed for financial success when moving to risk.
*   Moving towards risk (e.g., increasing risk appetite) is a goal for the Series A. What are the leading indicators you want to see with this seed round over the next 12-18 months that will give you confidence to begin these conversations with risk-bearing groups?
    *   First, I want to show we can move RAF up in a statistically significant way. Second, I want to get more concrete numbers around our MLR performance in this population + cost savings in avoidable ED/hospital cost systems. Third, I want to show patient and family satisfaction with this model compared to traditional primary care models.
