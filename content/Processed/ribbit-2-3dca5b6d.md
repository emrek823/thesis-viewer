# Ribbit Capital

"Only drug dealers and software companies call their customers ‘users.” – Edward Tufte

Dear Partners,

In case you are wondering what keeps the Ribbit team busy, here is the kind of discussion topic that passes for entertainment on a Ribbit night out: what do the world's top modern eCommerce, accounts payable, and restaurant POS software platforms have in common?

1) They all trade in the public markets at over 35x revenues
2) They all have CEOs with little to no financial services background
3) They all generate more revenue from financial services than their core software business
4) They all have financial services businesses growing at 115%+ YoY
5) All of the above

Since you have been listening to us rant for many years now, we're guessing you can guess the correct answer (if not, the answer key is upside down on the last page).

# Why all the talk about B2B software companies?

Since the start of Ribbit, our singular goal has been to find the world's best entrepreneurs working to change the future of finance. Digitally native companies have set out to change what the face of consumer finance looks like, and it is fair to say that we've seen the ground start to quake. Today, over 20M U.S. investors trade on Robinhood every month, 125M Indians a month access financial services through PhonePe, and more than 40M Brazilians trust their finances to Nubank – all companies without a single branch. In this letter, we're going to tell you how we think entrepreneurs of the same stripes - leading digital-first companies whose primary goal and core competency is building world-class software - are winning the future of B2B finance... and the $400B+ of revenue to go with it.

B2B finance might mean a lot of things—and it does to us, as you will learn in the next 2.5 to 90 minutes of reading this letter (depending on how much you like us). To try and clarify what we're talking about here, let's consider the case of Woodies Clothing, an eCommerce business run by a friend of ours (Jake!), who believes most deeply that the quality of your day is anchored to the thread count of your shirt and the pliability of your pants.

First, consider Jake's experience with financial services: he pays his suppliers in Southeast Asia with $25 wires that settle in days and touch 3+ financial middlemen. Shockingly, he gets regular complaints about unexpected delays, mismatched invoices, and surprise FX rates. Two years ago, his bank told him the smallest working capital line they offered was $800K (not surprisingly, they also felt he wasn't ready for it), and last year he reached out to them about a PPP loan but couldn't get anyone to answer the phone. The accountant he found on Upwork is often behind on payables, receivables, and taxes, and doesn't seem to have any better guess than Jake about the timing of his cash flows. He has an insurance broker who has him on an automated text drip about workers' comp and commercial auto policies, even though he has zero employees and doesn't drive a car.

Now consider his experience with modern software companies: Jake runs his store on WooCommerce, accepts payments and issues refunds with Stripe, runs marketing on MailChimp, manages support tickets with Zendesk, and acquires new customers on Facebook. These systems are the very reason why Jake no longer loses sleep over what his boss thinks or whether his team is going to show up on time; he employs just a single contractor despite millions in cumulative sales. They solve his problems in real-time, with transparent pricing and easily accessible support. Indeed, he regularly humblebrags to his friends about his impressive software setup.

Jake isn't alone. Average SaaS spend by small businesses grew nearly 10x between 2015 and 2019, and total annual worldwide SaaS spend recently reached $110B and is expected to double by 2024. Transaction data from the Ribbit portfolio confirms this – notably, Brex has seen software spend per full-time employee nearly double since 2019. In the last decade, innovation in software has fundamentally changed the way most businesses operate, but the way they interact with financial services looks eerily unchanged. Today, twice as many business owners still apply for loans at banks than apply to online lenders, three-quarters still buy insurance through a live agent, and nearly half of businesses with 10 to 20 employees still use paper or Excel. Something feels off.

So what's this letter about? It's about how these software platforms and marketplaces—the ones delighting Jake rather than disappointing him—are becoming the new point of sale for financial services. Very few business owners wake up excited to get a loan or make a payment or buy insurance. Rather, they are trying to buy things, grow, and protect themselves and their businesses. If software companies can offer convenient, personalized, and transparent financial services that help their customers (and sometimes supercharge or even transform their own businesses in the process), what's the downside? And if they can use their positions and data to make financial services lower cost and more accessible to business owners, why wouldn't they have an inherent distribution advantage over the traditional players? And given the sheer size of the sleepy incumbents, why wouldn't we be excited about how big the market can grow?

# Right...but what else is new?

You may have noticed that Intuit, Stripe, and Shopify are already $100B+ businesses. You may have seen Toast, Bill.com, and others soaring in the public markets as analysts work themselves into a frenzy over the embedded payments opportunity. We're writing to you on the heels of closing Bill.com's acquisition of Invoice2Go, a team with which we partnered in 2014 and an investment informed by this exact thesis. You may even take note that the third investment we ever made was in an accounting platform (ContaAzul!), or you might recall the 25+ bets we've already made in software companies in payroll, accounting, invoicing, investor relations, financial infrastructure, and more. You might even recall any number of slides from old Ribbit presentations, like this one:

# Yes, Yes, We Know We Repeat Ourselves...

## Two Ways to Look at How Software is Eating Finance

### What Does it Mean to Be a "Software Company"

**Software-First Financial Services Companies** (Ribbit Capital)
* Engineering, Product and Data are core functions
* Iteration and speed are a core KPI, with new products shipped regularly
* Personalization is accomplished through data and configurability
* Experimentation and user experience are guiding forces for decision making

**Traditional Financial Services Companies** (Ribbit Capital)
* Engineering, Product and Data are support functions
* Entrenched interests, bureaucracy and risk-aversion result in slow movement
* Personalization is accomplished through service
* Historical lessons and profitability are guiding forces in decision making

So, it would be fair for you to wonder at this point: Why are they still bugging me about B2B finance now? We'll try to keep this short, but it turns out we have our reasons.

1.  **It's still insanely early.** 20 years since its launch, QuickBooks Online has a total base of 5.1M subscribers. On the one hand, this is an incredible feat, giving Intuit deeper, richer financial relationships with more SMBs than any other company we see around the world. On the other hand, it represents fewer than 3% of the 220M+ small businesses globally. Or we can take the opportunity to embed lending in SME software and payment platforms (one near and dear to our hearts, since Ribbit's first investment ever was in the space). Despite the tremendous growth of programs like Square Capital and Shopify Capital, the two combined in 2020 for less than $1.8B in originations. This is 10% of what Chase did alone, and fewer than 50bps of the $350B+ of small business C&I loans outstanding in just the U.S. In other words, software companies are just getting started.

2.  **Software companies are growing faster than ever.** As you may have heard from any of your friendly neighborhood venture capitalists this past year, COVID-19 really shook things up for businesses, creating a snowball of demand for software to help with everything from taking orders to procuring supplies to tracking customers. In businesses of all shapes and sizes, operators have needed to reimagine their work through a digital-first lens. Every week, we are gaining confidence that these changes are not temporary; from barbershops (Squire) to restaurants (Toast) to auto repair shops (ShopMonkey) to salons and spas (Fresha), we are seeing traffic at levels 400% or higher than February 2020 levels. These dynamics have created opportunities for fast-moving entrepreneurs to capture businesses' data and attention and access some financial services wallet share as well.

3.  **The infrastructure for building software is getting much better.** The speed, sophistication, and accessibility of software development continue to make tremendous strides. It has never been easier to spin up and scale a new mobile or web app thanks to innovations like microservices infrastructure, API services, advances in database architecture, and front-end tooling improvements. As a result, it is getting easier to build software for any use case or vertical; for example, a recent search on Capterra across a mix of different merchant types (barbershops, restaurants, fitness clubs, yoga studios, dental practices, lawn care, handymen, dry cleaners, auto

repair, and childcare) yielded over 1,200 software vendors. And this software explosion is happening all over the world. After crossing 100M repositories in 10 years in 2018, it took fewer than just two additional years for GitHub to hit another 100M, owing in large part to rapid growth in emerging markets.

4.  **The infrastructure for adding finance to software is getting much, much better.** Historically, the resources and expertise needed to offer financial services kept most software entrepreneurs focused solely on software. Today, a wide range of modern infrastructure companies (e.g., Plaid, Razorpay, Ping++, Marqeta, Check, Parafin) have emerged, offering API-based services for facilitating loans, accepting payments, powering payroll, and more. These companies are now a feature of the fintech landscape in pretty much every market around the world; for example, Plaid (U.S.), Mono (Africa), Belvo (Latin America), and Tink (Europe) are each amongst a number of providers in their respective geographies that help developers connect to their user's bank account information. Further, in stark contrast to ten years ago, today a broad set of financial institutions are partnering with fintech companies. In the U.S., for example, dozens of Durbin-exempt community banks see fintech as a means to growing low-cost deposits and generating fee-based income to improve their ROEs (banks such as Cross River and NBKC have some of the best ROEs nationally). We're even starting to see big banks breaking ranks to partner with the upstarts (e.g., Stripe Treasury's launch partners included Barclays, Goldman Sachs, and Citibank). The growing competition for fintech business is accruing to software entrepreneurs in terms of redundancy, service, and pricing.

5.  **Governments are in on the game.** For all the bellyaching from some fintech folks about regulators, in many cases we see global regulators acting as a driving force for greater digitization and more innovative ecosystems. To highlight a few examples: In India, the account aggregator data framework provides an open platform for consumers to share bank account data. In Brazil, the public instant payment system, PIX, has gained massive steam since its launch in November 2020, with volumes growing from $5.7B to $101B in July 2021. In Europe, open banking regulations have made it possible for companies to use third-party software to aggregate their bank accounts, access financial data, initiate payments, manage cash flows, and update taxes. Meanwhile, e-invoicing mandates continue to sweep through countries around the world from China to India to France. This added push by governments is helping drive digital acceleration and enabling products that bring B2B finance into the 21st century.

6.  **Software companies are now able to find the playbooks and the people.** At the start of Ribbit, software entrepreneurs who wanted to get into financial services really had two choices when it came to talent: hire strong technologists with no experience or background in finance, or hire "innovative" financial services folks (e.g., find the risk-seeking people at Capital One) and hope they could adapt to fast-moving software businesses. Today, the work done by the first wave of fintech entrepreneurs—who have now trained, by our estimates, over 100,000 fintech natives around the world—is accruing to the next generation of founders, who no longer have to make a Faustian bargain on talent. There's now an abundance of talent that is as familiar with GitHub repos as with Mastercard interchange tables. Fintech talent abounds: For example, Stripe alums have started 37 different startups, roughly a third in fintech and crypto. Additionally, at Ribbit portfolio company Parafin, 18 of the first 20 employees have fintech experience, and seven of the last ten entrepreneurs we've backed at Ribbit are repeat fintech founders.

# Why Software Can Win

As constant students of financial evolution, we recognize that a lot of what we think is novel today is actually an echo of some previous innovation. Put more simply, not much is ever really new in financial services. Before Robinhood succeeded in offering cheaper trading, Schwab was doing just this. Before Nubank disrupted an oligopolistic, indiscriminate consumer credit market, Capital One did the same thing. The same is true of the trend we're talking about here. Long before venture capitalists started blogging about "embedded finance," financial services had been distributed by everyone from car dealers to industrial conglomerates to homebuilders. Putting aside how things ended, GE Capital grew from a simple white-goods financier born in 1932 as General Electric Contracts Corporation to a titan responsible for $637B in assets and nearly 60% of GE's profits prior to the financial crisis. So, this is hardly the first time that non-financial companies have seen flashing dollar signs in the money business.

But while the historical analogies hold many good lessons (and surely more than a few cautionary tales about companies stepping outside of their core competencies and mismanaging or mispricing risk), there are a few things that make us believers in today's software companies and marketplaces, even when cast against the most cynical "oh this again" perspective.

First, software companies today—built on instant access to enormous amounts of information, analyzed immediately with modern data tools—have far better customer insights than any previous generation of "embedded finance" points of sale. Consider, for instance, your favorite neighborhood pizza restaurant (we'll call it Sunrise Pizza, in honor of where Nick had his first date in 7th grade). Twenty years ago, an analyst at Sunrise's bank could, when prompted, check part of Sunrise's balance sheet and monthly cash flow; if Sunrise's bank happened to also be their merchant acquirer, that analyst could potentially look into daily sales (though Nick paid for his date proudly with cash). Today, Sunrise's bank might have an automated system to do that analyst's job. Now consider Sunrise's modern point of sale provider (let's assume Toast). Toast tracks the number of orders, types of orders, levels of inventory, types of customers, and number of employees working at Sunrise—and the same for another 100 restaurants and 15 pizza shops within 15 minutes of Sunrise. Or think about an online delivery marketplace like DoorDash, which now drives 25-30% of Sunrise's business, with insights into hourly demand patterns, instant feedback on the quality of Sunrise's food and execution, and a granular window into the local restaurant market. Or think about QuickBooks, which in a cloud era has a regularly synced view of Sunrise's full financial picture, not to mention information on 500 SMEs in Sunrise's zip code and Sunrise's owner's personal financial information in TurboTax, Mint and/or Credit Karma. Which would you bet on to understand Sunrise's ability to repay a loan? The bank...or Toast, DoorDash, or QuickBooks?

Second, today's software companies have a simple advantage in distribution, namely, the ability to bundle a financial product into their offering without having to reacquire the customer. While this point is not particularly novel compared with previous point of sale providers, we believe the advantage is more important in B2B finance today. In the past, businesses tended to have close, often personal relationships with their local banks and insurance providers. This made competition for B2B financial services a different kind of game: competitive, certainly, but not in the way that we see today with the intense, quantitative battle fought over every Google search, YouTube pre-roll, or App Store placement. Further, software companies today can often start with a more constructive relationship with their customers than those enjoyed by their banks or the previous generation of

`216.246.100.123`

embedded providers. Delivering on their core promises (e.g., tracking customers, enabling orders, and speeding up the back office) gives software companies room to build positive brand association, typically in a lower stakes, lower risk way than financial institutions, who start most customer interactions by asking an endless series of questions to meet compliance requirements or pass judgment on a business's creditworthiness. Is Sunrise's owner more likely to be interested in a random piece of mail from the bank inviting her to apply for a loan, or in a notification from Toast, DoorDash, or Intuit offering a customized, pre-approved line of credit, all available in one click?

Third, modern software companies are often positioned to establish richer, deeper relationships with their customers. Many of the top B2B software companies today have far more frequent and contextually-relevant touchpoints with business owners and operators than do traditional financial providers or previous point of sale providers. Further, because software platforms are usually multi-tenant, they can engage the right person at the company at the right time: while a business owner might be responsible for deciding to take a loan, a finance leader is likely empowered to decide whether an AP automation solution is best. And this can go much further, often reaching all of a company's employees or even their customers. Consider modern cloud-based payroll and scheduling companies like Gusto or Homebase, which regularly touch every one of their customer's employees. Or a modern cap table management system like Carta, Figure, or Pulley, that all keep track of every employee's stock ownership. Or a modern SME acquirer like BharatPe, which can surface a buy-now-pay-later offer for any of its merchant's customers. Which is likely to generate more depth in its relationship with Sunrise (or Sunrise's employees): their old insurance broker, or Homebase, which will soon deliver integrated workers' comp coverage while sending the Sunrise team notifications that they just got paid (with a reminder that they can access their wages early anytime they clock out, all from their smartphones)?

Perhaps most profoundly, the game being played by software companies is much more dynamic than that of traditional embedded finance providers. The advantage that a car dealership has over a bank in providing an auto loan is significant, but it is also relatively static; an offline car dealer today is doing more or less the same thing to win an auto loan that they were last year and the year before. If you compare this to the competition between a software company and a bank, the best software companies seem to have a compounding advantage: they are acquiring customers faster

and improving their platforms and products quicker than financial institutions... and then hiring more engineers to continue to accelerate the pace of this flywheel of customer and product development. Further (and unlike previous embedded finance providers), they are building on modern third-party infrastructure. So, whereas in years past, it was mainly the largest companies — the Walmarts, Sears', General Electrics, General Motors — that would consider adding financial services arms to their businesses, today software companies of one or two people can benefit from the constant improvement of API-powered financial platforms. As these advantages build on themselves, it might turn out to be a much more lopsided fight than we can even imagine today.

# Framing the Opportunity

Before we get started here, you should know that we've been engaged in a months-long battle over what Star Wars analogy or frog-naming convention was right for describing the companies covered in our thinking on B2B finance. Thanks to the persistence of Jordan and Matt, you have been spared.

So for now (and for all time henceforth), we will be talking about the software companies with the potential to become the new point of sale for financial services (i.e., the Toasts, DoorDashes, or Intuits) as Distributors. In Ribbit parlance, Distributors are vertical software companies, horizontal software companies, or software-based marketplaces that have the data and contextual relevance to distribute financial products to specific markets or business clusters.

While Distributors have built-in advantages over incumbent financial institutions (banks, insurers, brokers, acquirers, et. al.), most would-be Distributors couldn't or wouldn't choose to take on the complexity of building financial services capabilities themselves. We refer to the companies that solve this problem as Enablers—not the kind that encourage you to watch another episode of Netflix, but the kind focused on building infrastructure for Distributors to provide financial services to their customers (and often their customers' customers).

Since the start of Ribbit, we've invested in more than a handful of both Enablers (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay, Checkout, Plaid, Parafin, Balance, and Ping++) and Distributors (e.g., Salt Pay, Brex, BharatPe, Fenbeitong, Relay Payments, Stedi, Cora, and Settle). But, as you've probably figured out by this point, we're not done yet; the payoff for doing it well just seems too d\*mn big to us to pass up. To support this point, let's consider the potential revenue pools for Enablers and Distributors, with a spotlight on the $132B of annual revenue generated just in banking and financing, in SME, in the U.S.:

Segmenting the market this way understates the opportunity in some obvious ways. For one, the U.S. accounts for only 16% of global GDP and has only 12 of the world's largest 100 banks by assets. But perhaps more critically, we have seen time and again how this kind of market sizing often dramatically misses what the world looks like in the future—a future where a more efficient,

`216.246.100.123`

inclusive landscape powered by Distributors and Enablers might grow the size of the pie. We have already seen early players expanding the market. The average Square Capital loan, for instance, is $6,000, far below the point at which traditional bank underwriting would be profitable. Since less than half of small businesses have access to the financing they need, and more than a third are denied requested funding based on their credit scores (according to Fed surveys), we suspect there may be an iceberg of unaddressed demand hiding just below the surface.

So the market opportunity is huge and the macro tailwinds are at our back. But in a world where entrepreneurs are building new software platforms every day for every imaginable audience, and where "embedded finance" is becoming a hotter and hotter topic (the term "embedded finance" returns over 190M Google search results), how do we focus our time and energy? As always, we have some strong convictions (weakly held!) about where to look for value across the landscape of Distributors and Enablers. While we are excited to be proven wrong, here are a handful of the things we believe today:

1.  Financial Enablers will be the gifts that keep on giving
2.  Marketplace Distributors will usher a decade of B2B eCommerce
3.  Some of the biggest Distributors will be built on powerful software-finance flywheels
4.  Emerging markets and high growth clusters will be fertile fishing grounds for Distributors
5.  The largest opportunities today may lie in helping companies spend money, not collect it

# Financial Enablers will be the gifts that keep on giving

If there's one thing we've learned about developers, it's that they value efficiency and love moving quickly. To maximize both, developers have come around to fully embracing open source projects, solution-specific APIs, and any other tool that can help them securely and effectively avoid recreating the wheel. Since many of the components required to ship an application are ubiquitous, large enablers in the software space (aka Software Enablers) have sprung up over the past decade around the most redundant use cases. And, by and large, they've been fantastic software investments.

The core value propositions of Financial Enablers like Stripe, Razorpay, and Plaid are similar. Much of standing up a card program, offering payments as a service, or embedding an insurance product is redundant, and it would be painful, time-consuming, and undifferentiated to build and support the more redundant aspects of these products. As it becomes increasingly common for businesses to consume financial products from Distributors, we're convinced that the leading Financial Enablers who power them can compound at scale and replicate the success of their Software Enabler cousins.

We're willing to bet on Financial Enablers to reach $1 trillion+ in value because we see strong signals of a particular characteristic that all $100B+ companies share - the ability to compound at scale. To cherry pick an example, let's consider the embeddable financial primitive of card issuance. Over the past fifty years, banks have dominated this space, generating almost $30B of issuing-related revenue last year in the U.S. alone. But banks are suddenly no longer the only game in town. Today, Enablers like Galileo, Stripe Issuing, Marqeta, Tutuka, and Lithic are democratizing access to card programs, and we're seeing an explosion in virtual and physical cards issued by ambitious fintechs, retailer merchants, SaaS platforms, and digital marketplaces. We find it remarkable, though perhaps unsurprising, that 11-year-old Marqeta is already a top 10 debit card issuer by volume (if counted as a single issuer), and last year issued more debit cards than banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. And as we look forward to 2030 and consider how quickly Marqeta's users are growing, it wouldn't surprise us if Marqeta becomes the largest debit issuer in the U.S.

Making early investments in infrastructure companies like Financial Enablers requires unique patience, conviction, and long-term orientation. When Paystack started in 2017, there was no pre-existing pool of online Nigerian commerce to win away from incumbents, which made for a very confusing investor pitch! Paystack instead correctly foresaw that there would be demand for their online payments infrastructure as soon as it was built properly. Just four years later, Nigerian digital commerce is well into the billions and Paystack is processing around half of it. Stripe, which recently acquired Paystack, had a similarly underestimated addressable market. Patrick and John Collison sometimes liken starting Stripe to paddling out into an unknown lake of perceived opportunity, only to realize that the lake was actually an ocean. Today, Stripe is larger by payment volumes than the entire eCommerce market when it was launched in 2011. And the same is true for Enablers in markets around the world — Razorpay, for example, is 3X larger than the Indian eCommerce market when it was founded in 2014, and Stone is 1.3X larger than the Brazilian eCommerce market when it was founded in 2012.

The exact use cases for Enabler infrastructure can be just as difficult to predict. API-based product decomposability allows users to choose and assemble component services like building blocks, which makes it challenging to conceptualize market opportunities in the context of pre-existing industry paradigms. For example, a traditional soup to nuts payroll provider must store employee information, calculate withholding amounts, track time and attendance, provide compliant remittance capabilities, and handle forms and filings with external parties like governments. Everyone offering a payroll product must replicate these capabilities in-house, and competition between them often becomes zero-sum. On the other hand, a payroll enabler like Check might offer these component services piecemeal, allowing incumbents and new market entrants alike to selectively consume functionality and get to market more quickly. That means more Distributors can offer payroll services, which is bad news for Microsoft Excel, but good news for the 38% of payroll that still runs on spreadsheets.

And if we let our imagination stretch, it's possible to see a future in which Financial Enablers eventually become the new financial infrastructure that incumbents themselves choose to run on. According to McKinsey, it's estimated that by 2025, 30% of all global economic activity will be

mediated by platforms, up from just a few percent in 2020. To stand any chance of meaningfully serving them, banks will need to move off of infrastructure that runs on a programming language designed in 1959 (no offense, COBOL!). Together, Jack Henry, FIS, and Fiserv today make up over $160B in aggregate market cap with revenue associated with providing financial infrastructure to the banks between the three totaling more than $10B on an annual basis. It's an opportunity we're keeping a close eye on.

# Marketplace Distributors will usher in a decade of B2B eCommerce

In Back to the Future Part II (we know... we're showing our age), Old Biff Tannen gets his hands on a sports almanac from the future and gifts it to his present-day self as a cheat sheet to bet on sports. What if 2020 Micky could go back to 2010 Micky with the investor version of Biff's sports almanac? What would it tell him in terms of which industries to bet on? Lucky for us, fintech, crypto, and software would be at the top of the list, though eCommerce wouldn't be far behind. Global B2C eCommerce's sustained run in the 2010s was special, and as we look forward to 2030, we're excited about the macro opportunity we're seeing in B2B.

We believe it's time for B2B commerce's digitization, and COVID has provided a once-in-a-generation catalyst. For example, in March of last year, more than 46,000 attendees from over 90 countries were expected to attend the ASD Market Week in Las Vegas, a B2B wholesale trade show that attracts loyal distributors, importers, and retail buyers from gift shops to department stores. As lockdowns swept into place, that show, along with 88% of U.S. B2B exhibitions in Q2'20, was canceled. The remaining 12% of events were postponed (and then canceled as well). The abrupt halt of the $34B global trade show industry meant suitable digital alternatives needed to be found ASAP, and companies like Hopin were there to answer the bell (Hopin has incidentally now scaled to $70M+ of ARR despite being just a two-year-old business). We're willing to bet that once more efficient digital solutions take root they'll be here to stay.

B2B commerce has been slower than B2C to digitize, but the shift feels similarly inevitable. Manual transactions performed by sales departments and field sales teams conducted by phone, fax, and in-person still made up 42% of all B2B sales in 2020, but have already reduced significantly from 58% in 2016. Business employees are increasingly living in performant software and digital marketplaces, and it's only a matter of time before these applications figure out how to encompass and digitize the financial transactions that sit around them. For example, Balance, an Enabler that builds payments infrastructure for B2B marketplaces, provides embeddable checkout, lending, and payments solutions that allow marketplace participants to bypass manual multi-day invoicing processes with an instantaneous digital point of sale experience.

Speaking of verticalized B2B marketplaces, we're excited about the pronounced role they will play in digitizing B2B commerce. Today there are 50 industries in the U.S. alone with more than $25B of traded volume. All of them have specialized buyers and suppliers and other unique characteristics that create an array of opportunities for ambitious software entrepreneurs. The largest digital marketplace for B2B commerce in the U.S. is Amazon Business, which holds just 5% market share. General online storefronts like Salesforce, Magento, Shopify, and BigCommerce all hold fractional market shares as well. This is contrary to digital retail, where Amazon alone has 40% share. The

# Some of the biggest Distributors will be built on powerful software-finance flywheels

We hate to be presumptive, but if you've made it to page 16 of this letter we're guessing you don't think we're completely full of it (and some of you may even like us!). So what if we told you that we've started noticing that funding to early-stage companies labeling themselves as "fintechs" is declining? Is the era of financial innovation coming to an end? Is it time to polish up our resumes? Rather than spelling the end for Ribbit, we believe this trend is simply a re-ordering of classification that is consistent with the central idea of this letter: that software companies will increasingly morph into the point of sale for financial products.

The great financial rebundling that's underway will meaningfully improve fundamental unit economic equations for software businesses, and we expect to see more of them succeeding in verticals where software-only businesses have historically mostly been sub-scale. ServiceTitan, for example, is building an operating system for field services businesses, a market segment known to be difficult to distribute to with unit economic challenges characteristic of SMB-focused software companies. But ServiceTitan is flipping the script entirely with a slew of new products which revolve around embedded finance opportunities like business financing solutions, payroll, insurance, expense management, and payables financing. These products are not only multiplying ARPU figures but importantly, reducing churn. We're guessing that ServiceTitan's improving ARPUs and customer lifetime value metrics suggest that it should invest more in acquiring users, and over the past year, it has raised more than half a billion dollars presumably to do just that.

But behind this fancy investor talk about ARPUs and unit economics, there lies an even more meaningful point: these new financial products are allowing software companies to understand and serve their customers more deeply than ever before, opening doors to a host of fresh business opportunities. Take for example, what Shop Pay has done for its eCommerce merchants. For many of these merchants, Shop Pay has led to a 20% improvement in checkout conversion, which more concretely means a 20% increase in sales. That 20% is game-changing for most, and as a result, every Shopify merchant cheerfully(!) becomes a *de facto* acquirer for Shopify's consumer businesses. Today > 40M shoppers are storing their payment credentials with Shop Pay and another 50M+ users have downloaded the Shop app, which is presently the #3 Shopping App in the App Store.

Whether financial services are the tip of the spear that leads to more software (Settle, Brex, Square), or vice versa (Shopify, ServiceTitan, Juniper Square), it's clear to us that financial products are giving software companies even more meaningful opportunities to grow and serve their customers.

long-term orientation is as authentic as we hope, and as you may have already guessed, we believe many compelling B2B finance investment opportunities will be nestled in these economies.

Now, zooming in, put yourself in the shoes of the owner of a small retail business in India last year. As weeks of lockdowns turned into months, you had some really big business problems to solve. With cash becoming a four-letter word, how were you going to meet the cashless demands of your customers? And with mismatched timing in revenues and costs, how were you going to get financing when lockdowns ended? Now multiply these problems by India's 50M retail SMBs and you get a sense of the size of the problem (and opportunity!). To whom would you turn for help?

It turns out that many of these Indian retail SMBs are turning to a portfolio company of ours called BharatPe. At its core, BharatPe offers contactless UPI payment acceptance through a single universal QR code, but the app today has become much more than that. By gaining access to UPI payment flows, BharatPe is already disbursing tens of millions of dollars in loans per month and rapidly building out new credit products such as distributor-to-retailer financing and gold and auto loans for shop owners. It's quickly becoming a merchant super app, with its own banking license, not just a place to manage QR payments.

We believe entrepreneurs in emerging markets have opportunities to build operating systems for small businesses for a few simple reasons: 1) new business creation is higher in emerging markets and existing businesses are coming online at higher rates; 2) greenfield opportunities abound for localized solutions; and 3) huge swaths of businesses are underserved by financial incumbents (e.g., business credit is very difficult for SMBs to find). But we need to appropriately check our enthusiasm. We've invested enough in these regions to know that effective monetization and churn tend to be problematic, and it can be really hard to lend to mom-and-pop MSMEs who lack predictable cash flows or any form of reliable credit history (and who might prefer the "tax advantaged" nature of cash).

So what's changing? One thing we're paying close attention to is a growing wave of economic digitization reforms coming from governments around the world. For example, seemingly out of

nowhere, 10% of retail payments are transacting over India's fast-growing UPI network. We're now seeing other countries invest in their own real-time payment networks such as Brazil (PIX), Indonesia (BI-FAST), Mexico (CoDi), and Pakistan (RAAST), which all have a common goal of making it easier for money and data to change hands more seamlessly. We expect to find more BharatPe-shaped opportunities in other emerging markets as software companies find creative ways to utilize these new rails.

In addition to placing bets in fast-growing regions and countries, we're also excited to invest behind high-growth business clusters like eCommerce in 2010 whose growth will continue to compound at significant scale. For example, Cannabis, a market that has grown 35% annually over the last five years, is a market to which we're paying close attention. In under four years, Dutchie, which is building a Shopify-like ordering platform for dispensaries, has captured over 50% market share of legal dispensaries in the U.S. and Canada with a long runway still ahead. Today, these merchants are untouchable via traditional retail payment methods and banks, difficult to insure due to reinsurer resistance, and unable to access credit outside of hard money loans. These unique characteristics magnify Dutchie's opportunity as a vertically focused player.

The same challenges and opportunities exist for cannabis on the B2B ordering side. Wholesale cannabis marketplace LeafLink for example, today captures ~40% market share of wholesale orders across North America. COVID proved to be a catalyst as wholesale orders increased by more than 54% from January to June of last year, with over 50% of retailers increasing purchasing since the start of the pandemic. LeafLink is already well underway in its journey to fully embed payments and ancillary financial services into its marketplace. LeafLink Financial, for example, provides important and timely access to capital to meet the specific challenges of B2B transactions between retailers, brands, and distributors in the growing Cannabis industry. Impressively, both Dutchie and LeafLink have reached 40-50% market share in less time than it took restaurant and bar-focused Distributors to get to 5-10% market share.

# The largest opportunities today may lie in helping companies spend money, not collect it

Over the years we've been lucky to partner with businesses like Checkout, Razorpay, and Stripe who have each built enduring companies by helping merchants accept money online. While accepting payments has proven to be a good business model, we have become increasingly excited about the potential of a newer cohort of Distributors popping up across the globe that's helping companies better spend the money they've collected. Here are a few reasons why we're excited about these businesses:

1.  Business spend is becoming more decentralized than ever. Recent purchasing data shows that SaaS applications purchased and expensed by individual employees nearly doubled from 4% to 7% of total company SaaS spend in the last year.
2.  Modern card issuing Enablers are empowering more and more Distributors, across all categories of business spend, to issue both physical and virtual cards: consider that over the next five years, B2B virtual cards are expected to account for almost 80% of virtual card transactions by value.
3.  An emerging layer of APIs are enabling connections across core business systems that allows Distributors to build more powerful software. The days of businesses purchasing siloed tools for billing, accounting, and budgeting are increasingly numbered. As just one example, Codat, an Enabler providing Distributors with connections to small business accounting systems, now handles over 22M API calls per month.

We believe companies like the ones we've highlighted above have the potential to compound for many years: companies after all have to spend everything that they make in one form or another. As a consequence, the theoretical volumes that spend managers can address are in line with the huge volumes we're seeing from online payments companies, though spend is far more fragmented. Distributors focused on spend management can also expect to make healthy margins on their financial services products (e.g., card issuance and credit) while simultaneously selling software.

As business processes and financial transactions become closely coupled, there's a sensible opportunity to house them together in one software system. For example, Twic's employee benefits platform gets HR administrators, employees, and vendors efficiently operating and transacting in the same place. HR administrators can seamlessly transfer funds into employee wallets and enable or restrict vendors in the marketplace, employees can spend their budgets in a self-directed way via the marketplace or on a Twic-issued card, and vendors get reliable settlement and reporting data from marketplace purchases. By tightly coupling software and fintech, Twic has assembled a value proposition and economic model that hasn't existed before.

Over time, we expect the most powerful Distributors in this category to eventually look to capture all aspects of B2B spend in one place. We can look to China for some early evidence of this possible future. For example, while FenBeiTong started as a software and payments app to manage T&E, benefits, and procurement spend, the company has since launched multiple modules over the last two years including virtual cards (for budgeted expenses), an enterprise bill payments platform (to pay larger suppliers and vendors), and a reimbursement suite (to handle out-of-pocket employee expenses), not too dissimilar to Alipay and WeChat Pay's expansion into super apps innovating across the full spectrum of high-frequency consumer transactions (P2P payments, ride hailing, food delivery, travel, etc). Of course, the opportunity for FBT is far earlier—while over 90% of consumers in China's largest cities use WeChat Pay and Alipay as their primary payment method, FBT today serves just a tiny sliver of the 20M SMBs overall in China. As FBT grows its SMB customer base, it benefits from a powerful three-sided business model where it generates revenues from businesses (SaaS fees), suppliers (merchant rebates) and banks (profit share on deposits and lending yield).

# Entrepreneurs Requested!

In discussing the appropriate test for "obscenity," United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously wrote, "I'll know it when I see it." In a way, that's a fairly concise characterization of our job here at Ribbit. Despite all of our optimistic conjectures so far, we have very few answers for how B2B financial transformation is actually going to play out over the coming decades. That said, with all of this writing and thinking under our belts, we think we have a fighting chance of knowing it when we see it — and we will be ready to fund the entrepreneurs who will be far ahead of us. In order to come to those conversations with a prepared mind, here's what we'll be looking for:

## Entrepreneurs targeting the unique needs of emerging business types

We started this letter with Jake's story not only to juxtapose his divergent software and financial services experiences but also because his move from corporate employment to entrepreneurship is a pervasive trend we should pay more attention to. This is because, after new business creation cratered by 30% in the weeks following the March 2020 lockdowns, this trend reversed within a few months both in the U.S. and abroad:

*   **United States:** In July 2020, the number of applications for starting a business reached its all-time high of 551,657, an increase of 95% YoY. Total new business creation in 2020 went on to be the highest year on record. It's estimated that roughly a third of these new businesses created are digitally native.
*   **France:** 84,000 new businesses were registered in October 2020, according to McKinsey. This is a historical high and a 20% increase YoY.
*   **United Kingdom:** The number of registered companies increased by 30% year on year in November and December 2020, according to the National Statistical Office. Startups have been growing in the double-digits since June of last year.
*   **Philippines:** Total new business registrations were up 44% YoY according to the DTI, primarily driven by mom-and-pop stores that wanted to sell their products online.

Many of these new businesses look different than those traditionally served by legacy financial institutions. In Brazil, for example, ChatPay is building software to launch and manage paid WhatsApp groups for fitness instructors creating weight-loss programs or day traders creating subscription communities. Today, there are more than 50M amateur or professional content creators. These creators might manage income streams from a variety of platforms such as Tik Tok, Patreon, or YouTube, and share revenue with other creators for joint projects. Just as companies building the broader financial operating system for small businesses are starting from different wedges (corporate cards, upfront inventory payments, expense management, and budgeting software), we expect software platforms targeting the growing world of individual creators to launch from different starting points and hooks as well with the end goal of becoming the financial backbone for the creator economy (across banking, incorporation, taxes, and more). To state the obvious, a Citi business checking account wasn't built with a professional TikTok creator in mind.

With people of all stripes looking for ways to get in business for themselves, we are excited to meet the founders going deep to figure out how to enable and empower them. Barriers to entry for starting businesses are plummeting everywhere; we suspect the implications of this may prove to be far deeper than we can conceive of today.

## Entrepreneurs solving the problems of other ambitious entrepreneurs

In the early 2010s, an ambitious P2P payments startup tapped another recently pivoted startup to help it authenticate new user bank accounts automatically. Around the same time, a 20-person eCommerce startup out of Canada asked a company that had recently changed its name from /Dev/Payments for help building out its payments infrastructure. Today, Venmo and Shopify persist as anchor customers of Plaid and Stripe respectively.

They are not alone: Many of the world's most successful Enablers and Distributors got their starts by targeting other high-potential startups with their products and services. Aside from obvious growth potential, there are a few reasons why so many compelling companies begin by serving venture-funded startups:

Confidential

`216.246.100.123`

1.  **Ambitious startups lack pre-conceived notions of how problems should be solved:** Startup customers have 100 things to do simultaneously and put an enormous premium on simplicity and ease of use. They're not looking for something that starts here and ends there. They just want their problems solved.
2.  **Ambitious startups give excellent product feedback:** Founders see and directly participate in their operations end-to-end. Their visibility, experience, and willingness to iterate to a better solution can provide valuable product feedback loops.
3.  **Ambitious startups can be easier to distribute to:** Startup customers are small and oftentimes have simple needs. This means fewer customizations and easier implementations. There are no procurement cycles to overcome and decisions tend to be made quickly. Startups generally have more of a risk-taking mindset and are disproportionately willing to bet on early-stage partners to scale with them.

Venture-funded startups can also have financial needs that are unique. For example, we're noticing a growing number of entrepreneurs innovating around rising cloud and software costs. With the largest cloud contracts now well into the billions, even well-funded startups are paying closer attention to how they monitor, attribute, and forecast cloud infrastructure spend to optimize costs across different engineering teams. Here, rather than a CFO or chief procurement officer, the principal buyer might be a head of platform engineering. In the same way that TripActions has built an end-to-end corporate travel solution merging booking, management, and payments together, we might see large platforms similarly emerge for finance and ops teams aimed at cloud cost management which embed novel financial services over time (e.g., new types of financing for upfront commitments, insurance, etc.).

# Entrepreneurs working to make your CFO lazy

One CFO with whom we spoke last month noted that pre-COVID, 70% of vendor payments were made by check, with another 20% by ACH. Now, without employees in the office or having access to a check printer, 99% of total volumes have since moved to ACH. We're not sure what this CFO is doing with the extra hours such automation is freeing up each week, but we're glad she has them! As the below data shows, this is clearly not an isolated anecdote and reveals a huge opportunity:

Proactively thinking about automation is a luxury many CFOs at fast-growing companies do not have. Keeping up with a fast-growing business is hard enough! According to a recent Okta report, the average business today with 1,999 or fewer employees deploys 73 different business applications, up from 53 in 2015. Evaluating, onboarding, managing, and paying all of these vendors is a huge and typically disorganized task.

With an $18.5B market cap, Coupa is seizing this broader enterprise procurement opportunity to the relief of many large company CFOs. Today, Coupa manages a network of over 7M+ suppliers and more than 2,000 customers, with $2.8T+ in cumulative managed spend. But Coupa isn't for everyone: 80% of its sales are still influenced in part by integration partners like Accenture and Deloitte, sales cycles and implementation times are lengthy, and earlier stage and international companies remain underserved. It's a software opportunity we're excited about, brimming with financial services potential (e.g., embedded payments, insurance, issuance, etc.).

In a world where the modern enterprise today uses solutions like Zoom, Dropbox, and Slack, we wonder what a procurement platform built for today's companies might look like. What we might find is software for streamlining procurement workflows that is simple to use, integrations that go beyond the NetSuites and Workdays of the world to sync to more ERPs and modern HR platforms, a standard of automation across the board from data capture to vendor onboarding, and a seamless, and integrated payments solution from the start with ready-made financing options. These platforms might go after companies in Coupa's core markets, or focus on building in underserved markets, like China, India, and Lat Am.

# Software entrepreneurs not afraid to lead with financial services

While many of the best B2B finance companies start with software products before moving into finance, the opposite approach can be hugely successful as well. When Square launched in 2009, its first product was a small white card reader paired with a simple app that could turn any smartphone into a payments acceptance device. Brex similarly went to market with a financial service in the form of a corporate credit card geared at venture-backed startups. These initial financial products acted as a wedge to serve an underserved customer segment and required

unique infrastructure to deliver the desired product experience. These upfront infrastructure investments paved the way for additional financial services products and software to be shipped in rapid succession.

There can be huge advantages to building with financial services deeply ingrained from the start. Earlier stage companies like Settle, Pipe, and Capchase have all grown extraordinarily quickly with credit-oriented products, and all of them have high engagement and almost zero churn. The success of their initial credit products has earned them the opportunity to do more for their respective customer segments, including building software for them. All of these examples suggest that there's more than one way to skin the cat (or frog!) when it comes to building a successful B2B finance business, and we're eager to back software entrepreneurs that aren't afraid to lead with finance.

# Entrepreneurs making B2B feel like B2C

One of our fundamental beliefs at Ribbit is that well-designed financial interfaces win over the long-term, and you can rest assured that our mentality hasn't changed as we look to invest even more meaningfully behind B2B Finance companies. When it comes to interfaces and user experience, technology companies have always done a better job of serving attention-thin consumers than locked-in businesses. So it's no surprise to us that in 2021, sending money to a friend is a fun 10 second exercise in most geographies, while sitting next to an AP professional feels like a trip back in time.

## Cash App Payment
*   **Interface:** Mobile app showing $5 payment screen with numeric keypad, "Request" and "Pay" buttons.

## Bank Wire Transfer
*   **Interface:** Traditional bank wire transfer form (HSBC) with fields for sender, recipient, bank details, amount, etc.

## Balance Transfer
*   **Interface:** Balance checkout screen with "How to pay" options:
    *   Pay with an invoice
    *   Pay with Net terms
    *   Pay after delivery
    *   Recurring Payments
*   Navigation: "Next" button.

The success of consumer P2P payment apps globally offers a hint at how powerful a well-designed payment network can be as a wedge to offer more software and financial services. Square launched Square Cash (now Cash App) in November 2013 as a fast and easy way to make digital payments for peer-to-peer transactions. Square's growing consumer presence strengthens its value proposition to merchants as it continues to find more ways to bring these ecosystems together to transact. Square has now turned Cash App into a parallel ecosystem of financial services to help individuals manage their money. The key takeaway for B2B finance companies is to not underestimate the power of design and usability when building a great financial brand. Another is that financial networks require patience to fully form and monetize.

The world of B2B finance is full of opportunities to build vastly improved interfaces and user experiences. For smaller businesses where "AP automation" doesn't even enter the lexicon, we have seen newer B2B platforms such as Melio build network and volume by allowing small businesses to make ACH bank transfers to vendors via a modern interface for free and veer them away from paper checks. Consider that in a 2019 survey of over 3,000 small businesses, more than 40% experienced cash flow issues in the past year, and 61% reported regularly struggling with managing cash flow. Melio's wedge is simply removing operational inefficiencies with an efficient way to pay vendors and contractors. We're excited to back more software entrepreneurs who are similarly paying careful attention to design and user experience to improve business finance's interfaces.

## Entrepreneurs imagining the next generation of ledgers and ERPs (open or multi-tenant)

B2B payments are painfully manual. Every single payment must be properly approved, sent, received, reconciled, and recorded, and all of these steps need to occur with exact precision on separate systems in different organizations. To make matters worse, B2B payment methods like

`216.246.100.123`

checks, wires, and ACH have little to no contextual data as money moves around. It's no wonder that these processes have been so slow to digitize.

We can't talk about the mass modernization of B2B finance without talking about the need to modernize the underlying ledgering systems that track and record financial transactions. Today siloed ledgers are kept by every participant in money transacting ecosystems and data entry, adjustments, and reconciliations are manual. It's a clunky data problem that winds up having very real consequences.

Fresh food is perhaps one of the best examples of a supply chain that is both opaque and intermediary-driven, with orders and payments flowing via email, SMS, fax, and paper check. As a result, 75% of food costs come from the supply chain, and 30% of the food that enters never exits. Here, modern digital platforms such as Silo are structuring all stakeholders' interactions from farmers to restaurants and grocery stores, providing a streamlined workflow tool to manage all steps of the value chain including billing, purchasing, vendor management, and product selection on the buyer side, and catalog, inventory/order management, CRM, and logistics on the seller side.

In turn, these end-to-end systems of record can also provide accounting software to reconcile transactions on the buyer and seller side, becoming the de-facto accounting system for wholesale produce. By controlling the data on both sides, we might find that wholesale ordering platforms that can effectively become new general ledgers for an industry have a more seamless path to facilitate and monetize payments and leverage data to provide factoring solutions to parties across the supply chain.

# Silo Allows Food Distributors to Manage Ordering, Logistics, and Even Accounting

## Silo Workflow

**Seller (Grower)** -> **Buy** -> **Distributor** -> **Sell** -> **Buyer (Grocer)**

*   Each participant uses the `silo` platform.
*   **Ordering Interface (Seller/Grower):** Mobile screen showing "Order placed!" and options to Print, Email.
*   **Accounting Interface (Distributor):** Desktop screen showing accounting ledgers.
*   **Value Proposition:** "By connecting to both buyers and sellers through a single software platform, Silo allows distributors to manage both AP and AR and leverage end-to-end accounting, payments and access to lending."

Conversely, ambitious entrepreneurs looking to automate business finance practices may look beyond payments acceptance and deeper into accounting automation and ERP solutions. Our portfolio company, SaltPay, is an example of this. While SaltPay today offers a platform for EMEA merchants to accept various forms of payment, it could in the future look to automate more back-office operations by building or acquiring ERP software. By digitizing the merchant POS with integrated software, SaltPay will be in a position to use proprietary data to accelerate SMBs with additional financial services such as bill payments, card issuing, and lending.

Ledgers and ERPs sit in the middle of treasure troves of data in just about every major industry on earth; many founders building the next generation realize that sitting at the nexus of multi-party transactions is a hell of a place to assess risk, facilitate payments, and serve up credit. We have highlighted just a few examples here, but we are on the lookout for the many more we know are coming in the years ahead.

# In Summary, We're Open for Business

If you take one thing away from this letter (or if you skipped right to the conclusion), let it be this: what it means to be a "fintech company" is changing. And for business owners and operators all over the world, that could turn out to be a very profound thing.

In the early days of Ribbit, being a fintech entrepreneur usually meant trying to build a direct analog of what some financial incumbent had built, but doing it in new channels (especially mobile) and using technology to offer new consumer benefits (e.g. lower cost or more accessible). These intrepid entrepreneurs often spent the first two or three years of their companies' lives sitting patiently in the lobby of some bank, begging for permission to spend another two to three years building their own financial infrastructure. The best of them fought through these challenges and managed to still attract the talent needed to launch great, digitally-native products.

Today, the world looks very different for entrepreneurs tempted by financial services. Some of those intrepid first-generation founders decided to expose the infrastructure they built over APIs. With this gift, software developers of all types have been able to get in on the fun. On the one hand, this sounds crazy - what does a marketplace or SMB ERP or supply chain software platform know about financial services? On the other hand, when you stare at the problem long enough, you start to see these software companies as the most logical future providers of payments, lending, insurance, and other financial solutions. After all, business owners and operators don't wake up wanting to talk to their bank or insurance broker - they want to serve their clients and build a successful company, so if they can do this in a way that is faster, more personalized, and more accessible through the software they are already using, why wouldn't they? Just as consumer fintech entrepreneurs have been making branches obsolete with mobile apps, B2B fintech entrepreneurs will replace relationship managers, sales reps, and brokers with marketplaces and SaaS platforms.

This has all been going on for some time, as we can see clearly in 2021, a year in which Shopify, Bill.com, and Toast — three early bellwethers of the software-meets-finance movement with whom we started this letter — added tens of billions of dollars to their market caps. But when you step back and look at what has happened, and then you think about how few businesses around the world are actually accessing financial services this way right now, it is just... phenomenally early.

Not to wax too poetic, but this is the way we think things should be. When you step back from it, what really is the difference between software and financial services in the future? The two industries have vastly outpaced the broader market in value creation over the past 20 years because they are both fundamentally rooted in 1s and 0s in a world organized by information. As online commerce's share of the economy shifts from mid-single digits today to double digits (and eventually high double digits), software platforms will become the front door to most commerce and services. In this world, whoever has the best software and the deepest networks will win. These businesses should be in a position to deliver financial services the way we imagine they should be — generating profits when they help customers save time and money or creating new opportunities by empowering them to take risks, not by exploiting the regulatory moats and information asymmetries that mark much of financial services today. With only slight embarrassment at the stars in our eyes, we admit this is a world we are excited to invest and work towards.

To bring it full circle to where we started: hopefully when we talk now about a Shopify, Intuit, Stripe, or Coinbase — or someone else we can't quite see coming yet — growing into the world's largest financial services company, it no longer sounds so far-fetched. After all, it is often the case in technology that what looks like one thing ends up being another. Would any (sober) analyst have projected that a college website for snooping on crushes would become the biggest media company? Or that a DVD rental service would become one of the world's top production companies? The biggest threats to incumbency usually come from surprising places.

So expect Ribbit to be spending a lot of late nights and romantic weekends (don't tell our spouses!) dreaming about which sector of the economy is next to fall (happy) victim to the software-financial industrial complex. As software seeps into every part of the economy — and software companies find themselves in a position to make financial services better and more transparent — we plan to be close behind. We know we have blind spots and, yes, some unchecked enthusiasm, so please let us know anything that you think we are overlooking, underestimating, or just plain getting wrong. It will help us be better at making good use of our collective capital.

And if you made it this far, you deserve a round of applause and some comic relief.
