### Client
Hello. Thank you for talking to us today. We are doing some research on automation solutions for nurses and the new scribing and other copilot or workflow solutions that are on the market now. To start, could you tell us about your background?

### Expert
Yeah. I am a chief nursing officer over two community hospitals within a larger, I think, 50-hospital system. We are just getting going, I would say, with some of the AI stuff in our system and excited. I think we got a go-live at one of my facilities coming up in September for an AI solution.

Up until now it's been, I would say, more of a focus on I'll call it predictive analytics as it pertains to care of a patient, and that might be trying to review the documentation that's manually been entered in and then coming up with a fall risk for a patient or our deterioration index or are they at risk of sepsis?

That's reliant on right now with manual documentation. In September, the one facility is going to be moving towards having basically an AI scribe. The nurse will be able to dictate care and that will be uploaded into the medical record. That's just a high-level overview there.

### Client
I'm curious how you all ended up deciding to implement an AI scribe for your nurses. What led to that decision? Why did you go with the partner that you picked? Is it the same scribing solution that serves other clinicians in your hospital system, or are there solutions that you've looked at specifically for nurses?

### Expert
Yeah. Really, right now the only other one we have is for physicians, so this would be different. I think the decision to move this way was twofold. There's been a nursing shortage for essentially ever. It does not appear that that's going to get any better. With that, trying to find ways to become more efficient with our care. We've done some time and motion studies, and by far the most time a nurse spends is documenting. That led to look at, "Well, what can we do to reduce that time?"

Now that some of these solutions are coming out there, it seemed to make sense to explore that, to try to reduce some of that time to make the nurses more efficient and to give them more time hands on with the patient. I think that's a couple of the things. Also, if you can get a financial return on investment, maybe you don't need as many nurses to take care of the same amount of patients as you did today or prior to this solution, I think that's part of it.

From what I understand, for the most part I'm on the work group to help with some of this development, the vendor that was selected was done so because they offer it's not just this, but they have a package of IT or smart hospital solutions I think is what we're calling it. This scribe is one of those features. If we want someone that can help us with not just this, but a variety of things to make care a little more automated where it makes sense. We're not taking the human element out of it, but automating parts of care that we can automate.

### Client
When you say scribing is just one of those features, when you think about smart hospital solutions, what are the other types of things that would fit within that bucket?

### Expert
Yup. That's one. Every room for the most part has a dry erase board, a patient communication board. We're also looking at converting those to digital where the information would be pulled into that from Epic and updated real time as things are changing with the patient. Not a manual process with that. As things are either documented in the EHR or labs are resulted, they just would pop up on the patient screen to help with some of that communication and patient engagement.

Also, there's just a lot of manual process with, when someone's in, there's a number of things. They have diet restrictions or they're a fall risk or if they're in isolation. There are, in the past practices, all these different little pieces of paper that you got to hang outside of the room.

If that's all entered into, again, the electronic health record, having a digital display outside the room that lists all these things and just automatically populates that so you're not having to hunt down pieces of paper and put them up and switch them out and all that good stuff. Those are a couple. I think the next would be more focus on patient engagement and leveraging the TV, for example, that's in the room. How can you load content into a TV?

Moving from the cable to more of the web-based platform where there might be education things on there for a patient, but they could also access Netflix or games and stuff like that, and then with that, having the TV serve as a potential telehealth device that can extend our physicians a little bit as well. If we don't have a specialist at one hospital, they can do a remote assessment and leverage the TV for that or a similar kind of a monitor, I would say. Those are some of the things that are in works right now.

### Client
You thought of scribing as one feature within this overall thing that this vendor could help you do, versus something you would procure just by itself.

### Expert
Yeah. I think it started with trying to tackle what we're spending our most time on, and that's documentation, but then have a multi-year commitment from our system to really invest into tech and integrate care. I think that led to more of a broader search.

### Client
Got it. Within hospitals, how important is it for the nurses and the physicians to be on the same IT stack when it comes to scribing? Do you ever see, for example, the physicians are using Abridge and the nurses are using something else?

Both from the perspective of you obviously want to consolidate vendors where you can, but also, I'm not sure if any of these solutions are more purpose-built for the nursing workflow in any way, and therefore it's important to have something separate for nurses. I'm just trying to understand whether you would ever see a health system use something specifically for nurses or whether the products tend to be similar for nurses and then other types of clinicians.

### Expert
Yeah. I think from what you said about trying to limit the number of vendors is definitely important. Up until this point though, it does seem like the products that have been developed have been more role-based. Physicians have a little bit of a head start.

I think now what we're looking at is seems more nurse or I don't want to say just nurse, but other care teams specific. Ideally, it would be nice to have one vendor, and maybe what differentiates it is just your login access and the role you log into when you access a platform. I think that would make sense down the line to do something like that.

### Client
When you say the products are more role-based, could you add some color to that? How does the nurse's workflow differ from, let's say, a physician's workflow in such a way that the product would be different? Scribing, it's just picking up what you're saying in your patient interactions. What would make a product really work for nurses in a way that it doesn't for others?

### Expert
Yeah. For us, so far, the physician scribing has been more like in an office visit, I want to call it a little more of a controlled environment, or after the patient interaction is completed, whether that's a procedure or going in to visit with the patient in an ER room. They'll go back and voice scribe then. For nursing, I think like what you said is in the moment, so capturing that information real time.

If I'm doing my assessment as a nurse or working with the patient education, care planning, those things that take a long time, if I'm able to speak that out and then capture it real time, in the moment, I think that's key. For me, the big kind of elements would be your assessments, your care planning and education and then the other pieces that take a lot of time are your admission, really having an admission solution because that's quite a lengthy process to document right now.

### Client
To summarize, you're saying nursing tends to be more in the moment?

### Expert
Yeah. There are more touch bases. The physicians either once a day or they come in for a visit and done, but nursing, it's continual, it's 12 hours long most shifts. It needs to happen at the point of care in the moment.

### Client
Got it. I want to learn more about those areas you mentioned, like assessments, care planning, and education, admissions. What are you not seeing on the market right now where you think there's a problem that could be solved? I want to learn a bit more about what those problems are. What's missing, for example, in admissions?

### Expert
Right. There is a lot to admission. While I think you can have a lot of it memorized as a nurse, there's just so

### Expert
much to it. You start the admission, but I think there almost needs to be a prompt unless the screen's pulled up in front of you, but that's the whole reason to go to a dictation service is to get away from that.

I think somehow if you're doing admission, whatever you're dictating it to would voice prompt you to the next section or the next question. I don't know if that makes sense or not. There's just so much to it. You're doing like, "What's going on with the patient right now?" and then medical history. If you forget what's after medical history, you could say like, "Next prompt," and then say, "Okay, let's review your medications." I think a little bit of a voice assist with it would be helpful.

### Client
You think almost like a copilot, if a patient's been admitted and you're a nurse, you're coming to see that patient and you have some, I don't know, AI that is prompting you with what to check or do next, and it's capturing all that you're saying and summarizing that for you and feeding it back into the EMR?

### Expert
Yeah. Also prompting you to the next section or the next set of questions so you're not missing something.

### Client
The way that they explained it to me was, when a nurse comes in to start their shift, they get a handoff from the nurse who's leaving their shift. Right now, they tend to have a little scratch pad where they keep all their notes. One nurse is handing over this information to the other, they're taking notes, and then they begin their shift. What they've basically built is this mobile application that a nurse will turn on. It basically listens to the handoff. It's all verbally conducted. That information is all structured into a clinical note that summarizes the handoff.

It generates for the incoming nurse a to-do list of what they should be doing for the patients based on that handoff. It can pull information from the EHR on those patients, but then also push things back in if there are any updates that the outgoing nurse shared on that patient. They described it to me as a way to make the workflow a lot easier for nurses. It saves them time.

The way that they're quantifying the value here is by reducing the incidental overtime for those nurses who spend a lot of time on the handoffs. They were explaining this to me, and I'm trying to assess how valuable this type of solution is to nurses and nursing departments. I'd be curious to get your thoughts based on what I just described. Have you seen anything in that space around the handoffs? Do you think that's an area where there's unmet need right now in the system?

### Expert
I think, and this is just my opinion, but handoffs are something in nursing that culturally just hasn't evolved to keep up with technology. What I mean by that is in Epic, there's a thing that gets built as you document or as the patient's care evolves, like an SBAR template. It's a pretty concise thing that you can run down and get report on. It's structured and standardized, but not everyone's fully comfortable moving there.

Again, I think it's just a cultural thing in nursing, having that scratch pad. It's almost like an emotional attachment to that scratch pad, or they'll call it the nursing brain a lot of times. It's just getting people comfortable to move away from the old guard way of doing things and being comfortable with the technology that's out there. I understand what that company's trying to do, but I think it's more of a cultural thing to just adapt to what we already have versus maybe what the solution that they're trying to offer.

It's funny. Ten, 15 years ago, if someone had to leave early or something and then someone was watching their patients, we would have them voice record report into just like a voice recorder. The next nurse comes in and they would just listen to the report via voice recorder. The hang up I see with that is it doesn't give the best chance to ask questions. I think that's a piece that would be interesting to learn more about when they're using this technology.

### Client
I feel like that's often the challenge with getting these types of solutions scaled. It's sometimes much more

### Expert
of a culture thing than it is a technology thing. I'm curious about the Epic solution you mentioned. Is that a module that Epic has for these handoffs?

It's just a tool within Epic. You just can click and it gives you situation of the patient, background, the assessments, and recommendations or what's to come next.

### Client
Got it. Nurses could just go into Epic and do their handoff there and then the incoming nurse just picks it up.

### Expert
Yeah. They could just literally go down the list and read it. Again, that attachment of feeling the need to write down everything somebody's telling you, that's where we got to get away from. That's a culture thing within nursing. Some people will go back. If you have ICU patient, maybe they've been there for a week or two weeks.

Some people will go through every single day and it's like, "I don't need that. I've got this electronic record now where I can go back and look at that stuff. Tell me what happened during your shift. I can look up everything else." We just haven't gotten there as a whole.

### Client
Got it. Have you seen any of these scribing or even you were describing it as more holistic, smart hospital solutions? Have you seen any of these tech companies move into that space that I'm describing around handoffs?

### Expert
Yeah. Not specifically around handoffs, no.

### Client
Got it. On a scale of 1-10, how important do you think it is to make that handoff process easier? One would be nurses are happy with the way things are, and there's not really a whole lot to be done there. A 10 would be nurses are complaining that this is taking up a lot of their time and they wish that it could get easier.

### Expert
Right. I think it's six. I think there is opportunity there. The other thing that just came to mind with the solution you were describing, so there's a really big push to do part of that handoff at the bedside with the patient because you're talking about the patient, so they want to know what's going on. I think keeping the patient in mind is also key into this as well. I think that's one thing to consider.

### Client
Let's say you had your scribing solution in place, and you implemented it in the parts of your nurses' workflow outside of handoffs, since it sounds like that's still pen and paper. If you had another vendor who came to you and said, "We could trial this." Let's say your nurses really love it, and you're able to reduce overtime spend and could show ROI. Of course it depends on how much ROI they could show you.

How likely do you think it is that you would procure something like that alongside what you're already doing in scribing versus saying, "It's not important enough of a problem to invest in," or "I'm just going to wait for my other vendor to come out with other stuff so I don't have to work with multiple different vendors"? I'm trying to think about how easy is a product like this is to sell if it's tackling a new space within that overall workflow?

### Expert
Right. I think if it's a standalone product, that is going to be pretty tough. Again, I think a lot of the major players have something in there. It just hasn't been adopted by the care teams or not. Maybe not this

### Expert
product, but they have a more efficient way of doing handoffs versus the pen and paper, but that's just the nursing culture again.

### Client
How do you think about measuring ROI for solutions like that? Like they were saying long term, they really want to start measuring impact on patient outcomes and quality because they're able to document everything a lot better. That takes time to figure out how to measure and stuff. They were saying to me, in the near term, what we want to do is measure the impact on overtime because it's very, very measurable.

I'd love to hear from your experience. When nurses are doing these handoffs, does that often result in a lot of overtime spend because they're having to stay past their shifts to do these handoffs? I'm trying to pressure test what they were telling me in terms of ROI.

### Expert
Right. I think certain departments, it does lend itself to that. Some of those specialty areas, it seems to do that. Again, they feel the necessity to go back to day one of why the patient's here, or on the flip side of that, if you've got a unit where you've got a higher volume of patients you're taking care of. Obviously, talking about six or seven patients takes a lot more time than three or four patients.

That is a problem that we do encounter at times. You, right now, just try to help with that, you try to individually address that. Those are things we can see. As a nurse manager, you should be able to know that "Oh, this nurse is always here way past their shift, giving report or documenting or whatever that might be." That is a valid thing to address.

### Client
In terms of just rough order of magnitude, how would you think about how much money is at stake here for a hospital system? You might say if we were able to automate all of our nursing handoffs, they would spend X percent less in overtime. Is it a multimillion-dollar problem?

I'm trying to think about how big is this ROI potentially at a hospital. Obviously, it depends on the size of the hospital and whatnot, but let's say, per unit, could be potentially between $10,000 and $20,000 a year if you could decrease 15 minutes off of that per nurse per day?

We're saying ballpark, in a larger hospital, if you could save $20,000 a year on overtime spend, you're talking somewhere in the low hundreds of thousands of potential impact on automating the inpatient handoff. Your rough sense then is in order to buy this type of thing, it'd probably be at either low hundreds of thousands or maybe in the tens of thousands per year in order to justify that type of savings if they were able to show it. It's not a multi-million-dollar investment?

### Expert
I wouldn't think so, no.

### Client
Got it. That links to the next question I had, which is really around how you typically think about pricing for these types of solutions. I think some of the larger scribing vendors like Abridge and others, they typically are somewhere in the low hundreds per physician per month.

When you look at these types of copilot or scribing solutions in the nursing context, obviously, it depends, like I said, on the impact they're able to show, but do you have a rough benchmark in your mind for how much nursing departments are typically willing to pay for those types of things?

### Expert
Not really, no. I don't.

### Expert
The next question then is how does the sales process work? Let's say a vendor came to you and pitched you on this opportunity to automate inpatient handoffs. Let's say you were excited about it, and your nurses wanted to do it. Do you, as a nursing leader, typically have the budget to invest in these types of solutions, or do you need to go to another part of the organization that looks at digital or IT spend across the enterprise? How does that typically work?

Yeah. Typically, I would need to go and say, "Hey, I came across this product, really interested in giving this a shot." You're building the case with, we have a nursing innovation type team or whatever, pitching it there. Being part of a large system, what we try to avoid is maybe somebody else somewhere is piloting a similar product.

We don't want to have duplicate spend, really just making sure that "Hey this is new. This isn't something we've done before," getting that blessing for that building the case. Typically, what happens is it'll come back, work on some type of a pilot agreement with a vendor to roll that out, see what kind of impact that has. and then make the pitch to go system-wide.

### Client
Within your hospital, who tends to be the ultimate decision maker? Would something like this roll up to the CEO or the CFO?

### Expert
They would have involvement. If this was truly nursing-centric, that would be my ship to steer. I would take ownership of building that case and getting that enterprise support. At that point, it takes the CEO and CFO out it. It's like, "Hey, no. We've built the case for this, and this is something that we're going to do."

### Client
Got it. It sounds like there's a nursing and innovation budget that covers the entire hospital. It doesn't come out of necessarily the nursing department's pool of money for new solutions like the hospital?

### Expert
Yeah. It's more at the system type level. Again, I understand why they do that because it puts a little bit of a check and balance on things. If we're all blindly looking at the same product and nobody knows it, it's waste.

### Client
If you were advising them on what areas they should tackle beyond inpatient handoffs because, like you said, a lot of nursing leaders might be unwilling to buy something that is only tackling this one small part of the whole workflow, what are the other areas that you think this type of company should expand into in the nursing workflow? What they've told me is that they want to be more of an end-to-end nursing copilot. I'm trying to understand what else they should go and do.

### Expert
I think trying to streamline the admission process. Again, I talked about that earlier. I think that's a part of it. The care planning and patient education. Again, I'm just thinking about the things that take a lot of just time and it's repetitive time doing. I think that's important. I think the other piece that would help tremendously with compliance and quality and risk is there's certain things that have to be done at a certain time.

Say you've got somebody in restraints. Depends on what kind of restraints they're in, but every hour there's required documentation. If you're in the middle of doing something else, if that doesn't hit right on that hour, you're out of line. If you gave someone a medication and they're having a stroke, there's every 15-minute checks that have to be done. Anything that has a timestamp or a time requirement like, "Hey, this needs to be done at this time," if this could help maintain compliance with that, that'd be huge, I would think.

### Expert
Got it. If this type of solution could do those types of things that you're describing, would that make it meaningful enough to where you'd be more likely to invest in this type of thing, even if you have something else for scribing?

Yeah. It would save a lot just with the quality and compliance world, help with any accreditation visits you have or health department visits. That's usually what you get dinged on.

### Client
You talked a little bit about care planning and patient education. How would a solution like this work? The nurse is capturing all of these notes on the patient and what they should be doing. Would it be basically creating a care plan for that patient using AI, the nurse could review it and then could either print it out and bring it to the patient, talk them through it, or it would appear on the TV or they would get a text or however it might work, but it's basically automating that?

### Expert
Yeah. Some things might get populated in the care plan, but it's a pretty manual process where you have to go and build the care plan. You have to go in and search for what's going on with the patient, find it, build it, and then build your patient education around it. If it's listening to your conversation with the patient throughout the admission process and capturing orders that are put in or diagnosis that are put in, if it could build that care plan like you were saying and the nurse would just validate it, that would be huge.

### Client
All of this is done in Epic?

### Expert
For us, yeah. Other systems, it's whatever, Cerner or MEDITECH or whatever they might have. Nursing worldwide, you have a care plan, and you have patient education.

### Client
Epic already captures a lot of this information. I imagine that might be the direction they're moving in. They already have all this information. They could just use AI then to create these care plans for the patient.

### Expert
Yeah. It's been a minute since I've done it just because I'm separate to removed, but there are a few things that get pulled into it. What we're finding when we have an accreditation visit is it's not customized enough to what's going on with the patient that visit.

### Client
I'm curious to get your thoughts on some of the scribing companies in this space, or really any kind of nursing automation solution. It could be scribing or anything else in this workflow space that we've been describing. The ones that I've come across are Abridge, Nuance, Ambient, Suki, Augmedix, are you familiar with any of them? Are there others that you would think about as being potential competitors? Do you have any thoughts on them, either having used them or had peers who have used them?

### Expert
Nuance. Haven't heard too much on those. What we're looking at is I think it's hellocare product. That's what we're going forward with.

### Client
Okay. Thank you very much. This was really helpful. Bye.
