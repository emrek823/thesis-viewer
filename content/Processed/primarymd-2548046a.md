## Slide 2: The Reality of Primary Care

PrimaryMD

The Reality of
Primary Care

It's
Broken

**Reactive by Design**
- 5.9 minute Average Visit
- 26.7 Hours required per day, per doctor, to follow all guidelines

**Physicians Overloaded**
- 20% plan to leave within 2 years
- 47% of PCPs burned out

**Doctors Underpaid**
- 33% decline in Medicare reimbursement since 2001

## Slide 3: Market Opportunity

PrimaryMD

Market
Opportunity

Higher Costs. Higher Demand
for Personal Care.

**Consumer Spending**

Self-pay market
is growing
**7% annually**

**Consumer Spending Trend:**

| Year | Value    |
| :--- | :------- |
| 2012 |          |
| 2023 | $470B    |

Consumers are willing to pay out of pocket for alternative care.
Frustration with traditional care drives demand for other solutions.

## Slide 4: Out of Pocket Dilemma

PrimaryMD

Out of Pocket
Dilemma

No Clear Options

Even patients who are
willing to spend still
struggle to find a
solution they can trust.

**Concierge Care**
Reactive, pays for access,
not proactivity.

**Functional Medicine**
Limited scope,
not comprehensive.

**Longevity Clinics**
Experimental,
expensive,
niche.

**PrimaryMD (Intersection)**
Proactive,
comprehensive,
accessible care.

The Human
Advantage
Realized:

How Personalized Care
Changes Everything

**Lifespan vs. Healthspan in Medicine 2.0 vs. PrimaryMD**

*(Graph shows Healthspan on Y-axis (0% to 100%) and Lifespan on X-axis. Three lines illustrate the effect of different care models over time.)*

| Intervention Type | Description |
| :---------------- | :---------- |
| No Intervention   | Healthspan declines earlier and more sharply. |
| Med 2.0           | Healthspan declines later than No Intervention but still significantly. |
| With PrimaryMD    | Healthspan remains at 100% for a longer period and declines later and less steeply than Med 2.0. |
