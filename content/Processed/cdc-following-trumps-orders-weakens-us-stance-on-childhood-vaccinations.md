CDC, following Trump’s orders, weakens US stance on childhood vaccinations

In a drastic decision made outside of its typical review process, the agency declared it would recommend 11 childhood shots going forward, down from 17.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now universally recommend 11 vaccines instead of the previous 17, a move that the Department for Health and Human Services said would better align the U.S. schedule with those of certain other wealthy nations. The decision is effective immediately.

The new recommendations aren’t a mandate, as individual states craft their own vaccine requirements. But the agency’s guidance does influence statewide decisions.

The move, then, represents a massive shift in vaccine policy and one enacted without the CDC’s typical rigorous process, which involves the public vetting of evidence by independent scientific reviewers. It also achieves a long-held goal of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense before his short-lived presidential run — and follows a Dec. 5 order from Trump to look into the way “peer nations” recommend vaccines.

According to the HHS, the decision to upend current standards was the result of an assessment led by Tracy Beth Høeg — a COVID-19 vaccine critic who now runs a top Food and Drug Administration office — and Martin Kulldorff, a recent CDC vaccine panelist who previously served as an expert witness in litigation against Merck & Co. over its HPV shot Gardasil.

Additionally, the U.S. schedule closely resembles the immunization protocols in multiple countries involved in the HHS’ review — among them Britain, Australia, Canada and Germany. The vaccine policies of many nations also depend on population demographics, as well as differences in healthcare coverage and the types of disease threats their citizens face.

“Comparing the U.S. childhood immunization schedule to that of Denmark or other countries ignores fundamental differences in population size, diversity, healthcare access, and infectious disease risk. These differences matter,” said Robert Hopkins, Medical Director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, in a statement. “U.S. immunization policies must be guided by a transparent, evidence-based process and grounded in U.S. epidemiology and real-world risk.”

In an email to BioPharma Dive, Richard H. Hughes, a partner at the law firm Epstein Becker Green, also noted that the move may be “unlawful” under the Administrative Procedure Act, which directs agencies to carry out thorough processes before making major policy shifts.
