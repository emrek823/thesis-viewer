## Slide 16: How Garner Works: Keep Your Existing TPA

| Plan Type         | Plan Actuarial Value |
| :---------------- | :------------------- |
| Traditional Plan  | 80% - 100% (exact value appears to be around 90%) |
| HDHP              | 60% - 80% (exact value appears to be around 70%) |
| Garner Base Plan  | 60% - 80% (exact value appears to be around 70%) |

**Garner works with employers to identify a high deductible plan**

## Slide 17: How Garner Works: A Turn-key Incentive Account

| Plan Type         | Plan AV |
| :---------------- | :------ |
| Traditional Plan  | ~90%    |
| HDHP              | ~70%    |
| Garner Plan       | ~70% (base plan) + ~30% (incentive account overlay) = ~100% |

**Garner administers a turn-key incentive account overlay that covers deductibles and co-insurance for engaged members seeing a Top Doctor**

www.getgarner.com

## Slide 18: Employers Save Money Regardless of Engagement

| Plan Type         | Doctor Type   | % of Care Covered by Employer | Total Coverage |
| :---------------- | :------------ | :---------------------------- | :------------- |
| Traditional Plan  | All Doctors   | ~85%                          | ~85%           |
| Garner Plan       | Top Doctors   | ~95%                          | ~95%           |
| Garner Plan       | Other Doctors | ~65%                          | ~65%           |

**(40% reduction in medical spend - 20% lower deductibles) = 20% savings** (applies to Top Doctors in Garner Plan)
**Higher deductibles = 10% cost savings** (applies to Other Doctors in Garner Plan, relative to Traditional)

## Slide 19: Garner Guarantees Employers a 10% Cost Reduction
**Employer Healthcare Costs (per person per year)**

| HDHP              | $5,500                                        |
