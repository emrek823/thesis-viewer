## Abstract

Explainability domain generalization and rare class reliability are critical challenges in medical AI where deep models often fail under real world distribution shifts and exhibit bias against infrequent clinical conditions This paper introduces XAIMeD an explainable medical AI framework that integrates clinically accurate expert knowledge into deep learning through a unified neuro symbolic architecture XAIMeD is designed to improve robustness under distribution shift enhance rare class sensitivity and deliver transparent clinically aligned interpretations The framework encodes clinical expertise as logical connectives over atomic medical propositions transforming them into machine checkable class specific rules Their diagnostic utility is quantified through weighted feature satisfaction scores enabling a symbolic reasoning branch that complements neural predictions A confidence weighted fusion integrates symbolic and deep outputs while a Hunt inspired adaptive routing mechanism guided by Entropy Imbalance Gain EIG and Rare Class Gini mitigates class imbalance high intra class variability and uncertainty We evaluate XAIMeD across diverse modalities on four challenging tasks i Seizure Onset Zone SOZ localization from rs fMRI ii Diabetic Retinopathy grading across 6 multicenter datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements including 6 percent gains in cross domain generalization and a 10 percent improved rare class F1 score far outperforming state of the art deep learning baselines Ablation studies confirm that the clinically grounded symbolic components act as effective regularizers ensuring robustness to distribution shifts XAIMeD thus provides a principled clinically faithful and interpretable approach to multimodal medical AI.
