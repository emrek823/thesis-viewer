## Summary
The Tegus Client engaged in discussions with experts regarding the selection and deployment of an AI solution for a Texas Medical Center. Criteria such as ease of use, integrations, features, customization, price, and reporting were considered when choosing between vendors like Assort Health and Hello Patient. Ultimately, Hello Patient was chosen for its AI capabilities in appointment scheduling, while Assort Health excelled in new patient triage. The deployment of Hello Patient was highlighted to bring ROI after the 10th to 12th month, with plans to expand to other specialties for a more than 5X return in two years. The value of the system varies across specialties, with some benefiting more than others, and the impact on scheduling teams was also discussed.

## Client Interaction

**Client:** Thanks for spending time with us. My colleagues and I are really interested in learning a little bit more about this voice AI space. Know that you are a customer of Hello Patient. Just give us a little bit more context about you, your employer, and then this broad process of looking for and adopting one of these products.

**Expert:** Yeah. I'm an IT director. I've been in this role for 16 years within the healthcare side, more so on the hospital side. The conversation that we're going to be having today is pertaining to a Texas Medical Center where we have inpatient services, we have outpatient services, and then there's two things that we're basically going off of. One thing is creating some efficiencies internally, whether they be operational or they'll be technical, and then the other side is creating efficiencies on the patient side. How do we create efficiencies around both these areas?

**Sean Doolan**
**DO NOT COPY**
**sd@virtuevc.com**
Conducting assessments with key stakeholders internally to identify, "Hey, where's the gap? Where can we put a solution in? Where can we put technology in that the byproduct is that we're seeing more patients and we're able to get more volume through and more revenue?" That's how we look at many of the implementations and considerations within the organization.

----

## Product Search Timeline

**Client:** Got it. When did you guys start looking for a product in this space?

**Expert:** Initially started looking in 2023. Didn't really find anything that we were very comfortable with, then crept into 2024. The big difference between 2023-2024 was that there were more organizations that ended up implementing these AI solutions. How did that help us? It helped us tremendously. I was able to reach out to my peers and my peers were basically able to tell me, "Hey, yeah, this is what we considered in the implementation," and then when we did the implementation these are the challenges we ran into, for example, AI solutions.

You're going to run into issues with like rules permissioning, how do you build a rule, how do you map everything to a specific workflow, how do you get data from the EHR in and out? How do you get it from these solutions back into your EHR? A lot of different things that we depended on our peers to validate and cross check so that when we go through the implementation, it's more solidified, it's more addressed by each one of these vendors.

That's the reason why finance and budget and all that kind of stuff was delayed as well, but we had reached out to corporate and corporate had basically said, "Hey, there's a few solutions out here if you want to evaluate, Assort Health, Outbound AI, Hello Patient." There was another one that they put in there, and so

we evaluated a few of them and that's where we felt like evaluating each one of them, there's quite a few differences in how each one of these do this. Do we want an online software basis?

**Client**
I can just clarify, when you talk about AI solutions initially and all these considerations of getting data in and out, mapping things to workflows, was this a consulting firm you were working with? Was this a homegrown effort and just you guys naturally thinking about these considerations, where do you fit in there?

**Expert**
No. Not necessarily a homegrown solution, but more of an off-the-shelf solution that has the ability to have API integrations. As long as they have API integrations, then we're able to push and pull whatever we need and they're able to do the same thing. It's more of an effort between that vendor and us.

**Client**
Got it. What you were describing were just considerations as you think through vendor selection?

**Expert**
Yes. The number one thing is ease of use. We want to make sure the solution is easy to use, easy to navigate through, easy to configure basically. Second item is integrations. We want to make sure that these integrations have API integrations. They have full context across all different service lines. The one complexity area that we have with our internal structure is that not just API but also typical HL7 integration. Do you have the ability to do that? Integration is a very big piece in making sure that this implementation of the software gets utilized so it's 100% capacity.

The third one is reviews, peer reviews, and references. We like to reach out to our peers and reach out to customers that have already implemented like Assort Health, Hello Patient, and Outbound AI, Hailo and just get their feedback. "Hey, what's your feedback on the solution today? What's your feedback on the solution three months post implementation and then 12 months post implementation?"

Sean Doolan
It really gives                                  DO NOT COPY
you a good idea how the support team works and how the implementation and the engineering team works in getting it where you want it       sd@virtuevc.com
to be. We go into the fourth item is the features and functionalities, the robustness, then we want customization, and the other thing we look at is the price, and then last we look at the reporting and analytics.

**Client**
Got it. Help me understand, when did you run your evaluation process and how did you ultimately land on Hello Patient's?

**Expert**
We ran an evaluation in 2023, then we ran it again in 2024, and then Q1 2024 and then implemented in Q2 2024, so basically been using it for a year.

**Client**
Yeah. What was your feedback on Syllable, Bland, you mentioned a bunch of these? Why go with Hello Patient? What reasons compelled you to do so?

**Expert**
That piece is very interesting because whenever all these evaluation criteria that are just covered, we put those to every single one of these particular solutions. Outbound AI, Syllable, Hailo, Assort Health, Hello Patient, and then we have an internal metric system. Everybody who's sitting through the evaluation, whether they be operational type, whether they be technical side, or whether they be the clinical side, they're scoring each one of these vendors on these evaluation criteria and so we went to the route of scoring them on a score of 1-10.

## Transcript

**Expert:** Like ease of use, Hello Patient scored a nine, Assort Health scored a nine, Hailo scored I think it was a six, Outbound actually I have it in front of me now. Outbound AI scored seven, Syllable scored six. You can see from this how each one of them are scoring. Assort Health and Hello Patient were the ones that were like neck and neck with each other in many aspects.

**Client:** This was as of Q2 of last year.

**Expert:** That was Q2 last year, yeah. If I'm doing today, I'm going to be honest with you, Assort Health has made quite a lot of strides. The reason why I'm saying that is because we've had a lot of peers reach out to me and say, "Hey, you evaluated Assort. How did that go?" A lot of people are implementing it in different areas. I have to tell them, "Yeah, it's good. Their AI agent has definitely improved." When you look at multi-specialty implementations, Assort Health has more of a mature standing and implementation penetration within multi specialties versus Hello Patient.

**Client:** Yeah. This is really interesting and I'm curious, maybe help me understand a year ago, which use cases or what defines success? I know you described the four factors, but to be more specific, Hello Patient did this better than Assort. Assort did XYZ better than Hello Patient, and then now you're hearing that Assort is pulling away. We're very interested in learning about that company and frankly want to understand what the most up to date view is. If there's specifics on product advantages or product depth or features you alluded to multi-specialty, would love your perspective there.

**Expert:** Yeah. Bottom line, what does Assort Health do better than Hello Patient? The one thing that they definitely do better is that they cater to different service lines, different multi-specialties. When you look at the core product and you say, "Hey do you do appointment scheduling?" Yes, both of them do that. The difference is that I can actually build AI rules into Hello Patient and have it handle scheduling, reminders, as well as appointment management entirely within an AI structure.

If it calls a patient doesn't get a particular time, then it will actually look through other times and actually get that put into place. With Assort Health, there isn't too much of an AI component that can say, "Hey, okay, let's see these times are available, this time let's put you in at this time." It's actually going to reroute that call to a live agent. That's the appointment and the scheduling because that's the very first thing that you do on the front end.

**Client:** Just to clarify, what you described, it sounded like a strength for Hello Patient rather than Assort. Is that correct?

**Expert:** That is correct, yes.

**Client:** Okay. Now you're telling me what Assort does better than Hello Patient?

**Expert:** No, not really.

**Client:** What Hello Patient would be better than?

# Expert Discussion on Assort Health vs. Hello Patient

## Expert Insights
Yeah. The other front-end piece, which is the insurance verification, the benefits verification, that Hello Patient does a little bit better. It's much faster, it's much more complete, it's much more thorough. Now, where things get a little bit different is actually, in my opinion, where Assort Health stands out most. When a new patient calls in and they're going through that whole triage process and entering the patient in, that is where Assort Health differentiates the most. It will actually create a patient within the system and flow into the EHR system.

Does somebody need to speak to this new patient? No. They can basically grab everything for the patient and then enter everything into the application. That piece is a very strong piece for new patients coming into the environment. There's an AI component to that which is very smart and it's very comprehensive. If it hasn't completed something, then it's going to put it in front of the dashboard for the clerk sitting at the front and then basically they can go back and either have Assort go and pull that information or go and source that information on their own. That is pretty good.

The other piece which is pretty good is the automation. There's a lot of automation, like underlying automation that you can build into the application. Let's just say there's a particular referral that comes back and that referral comes back with 10 pages. I can build automation to say, "Hey, pull out all this relevant information and summarize it for me." I can do that in Assort Health. I cannot do that in Hello Patient.

Besides that, I think they're neck and neck with everything else. The other big piece that physicians always look at is ordering and prescriptions and refills and stuff like that. Can an AI system automatically refill this based upon rules within your EMR system? I think both of them do that very well.

## Client Feedback
Yeah. It sounds like Assort Health has maybe deeper workflows that are a bit chunkier. There's pieces also getting the scheduling to be more automated or end-to-end that Hello Patient does better and instead of maybe some things on eligibility that they have fine-tuned, but Assort seems much broader and have a few more health center real administrative workflows.

### Sean Doolan
**Expert**
Yes. The other thing that I didn't mention with Assort Health is that they don't have very much of a reporting and analytics. It's there but it's very bare bones compared to Hello Patient. It's pretty robust like it's day and night difference.

## Client Inquiry
How's your deployment with Hello Patient gone so far and what's been the value or the ROI?

### Expert Response
It's very interesting because a lot of the peers that we had communicated with and we asked that three-month and 12-month mark, but we came to notice that we should have done that more of a six-month and 12-month mark. The first six months you're putting in a system, you're getting acquainted with the system, you're getting comfortable, if the end users are getting comfortable. There's really not much value in the first six months, you're still configuring, optimizing the product, but it's that 10th, 11th, 12-month, that's where you start seeing the value from the product. We're actually seeing value now, but in the first six months, don't expect any value, like ROI from the product itself.

## Client Clarification
I see. That's because it just takes so long to implement and get it up and running?

### Expert Clarification
No. It's more of implementation is not a problem. Implementation takes a mere two months, most building and configuring the system. Once you go live, there's a lot of these tweaks that you need to make to the system. There's a lot of these optimizations that you need to do. You never come to that feeling, oh, I'm utilizing this product to its 100% capacity and it's giving me that utmost value. I'm creating efficiencies now.

You will never get that feeling the first six months, just because it's a change process.

You're reviewing what is being sent out. You're reviewing what AI is doing. You don't have trust in the first six months, but then after that, so your stuff starts actually getting processed correctly, then you start gaining confidence in the system. First six months, there's no confidence.

## Client
Got it. Fast forwarding a year, now you've had them in place, do you think you'd ever switch vendors? Do you have any regret over choosing Hello Patient over Assort or you're happy with your decision?

## Expert
No. We're pretty happy with our decision and for the reason why is because the main thing is I have a reporting and analytics system built into my Hello Patient. I can look at the metrics and identify, hey, where were we six months ago, where are we now? Or where were we 12 months ago and where are we now? You can actually see significant difference in the number of patients coming in, number of patients calling in, number of patients being 100% routed via AI, handled into 100% via AI.

We're seeing value from it. We're seeing more patients. Now, the thing for us is how do we roll it out into our orthopedic services? It's currently being used in pediatrics and our OB-GYN environment. It's now about rolling it out more to more specialties and less about replacing it.

## Client
How are they priced today?

## Expert
Fairly competitive. There's really not that big of a difference between Hello Patient and Assort Health to be honest with you.

## Client                                      Sean Doolan
DO NOT COPY
Could you tell me maybe how Assort          sd@virtuevc.com
is priced then?

## Expert
Yeah. It's subscription based.

## Client
Maybe just give me a range. I just want to understand for an organization your size, what rough spend is there, just broadly.

## Expert
Let me put it this way, if I had an FTE that was doing this job and I let that FTE go and I was paying let's say FTE about $50,000 a year. This system is well under that for the whole year, probably even half of that.

## Client
That's just across pediatrics and one other?

## Expert
Orthopedics.

## Client
Orthopedics. This is one location in Texas?

**Client**
If you extrapolated across like the system across other departments, what do you think that can become?
Let's say you expanded and you used Hello Patient across all addressable use cases or providers. Is it a 5X?
Is it a 10X? Is it a 20X? What is it?

**Expert**
Number one, we wouldn't go all out. It would take some time and I can tell you that the goal two years from now is to actually get to more than 5X with wherever we have it implemented. We're going into family practice and we're going into a few of the areas where we're going to be implementing it, so we definitely want more than 5X.

**Client**
In two years you want more than 5X, what would that represent in terms of percentage of percent penetration essentially?

**Expert**
Into what though?

**Client**
Into all theoretical offices or all types of providers who you could schedule with.

**Expert**
That's probably 30%, 40% penetration. There's still another 50%, 60% that's out there that we could tap into.

**Client**
**Sean Doolan**
**DO NOT COPY**
sd@virtuevc.com

Why be so deliberate or slow with it?

**Expert**
We take it one step at a time. Everything is per department, so we can't look at it as the whole RHC and the multiservices that we provide. Each one of these implementations are very multi-specialty selective. If I'm implementing it in pediatrics, I'm looking at the value and the ROI specifically to pediatrics and the revenue that's generating from there. I can't say that I've implemented it all across my multi-specialties and this is the value I'm getting because guess what, that value is going to not be as well as it should be. I'm going to get more of a better value or number when I look at it individually per multi-specialty.

**Client**
Help me understand why the value would be lower for some specialty groups or some folks versus others. Maybe it's just context on your organization, CortiCare?

**Expert**
No. It's not CortiCare. The logic behind that is that some specialties or some practice areas have more volume of patients coming through. Some do not. For example pediatrics, OB-GYN, that's constantly revolving, constantly new patients coming in. It's actually they work in tandem but orthopedics, that's pretty flatline. We don't see very much over there. Family medicine, primary care, the volume and the growth opportunities there are not as big, I should say. The opportunity is there but unless we do something extremely different, only then we'll see that growth there. It hurts some areas and it's good for other areas, so that's just how it works.

**Client-Expert Conversation**

**Client:** What you're saying is there's a decent number of new patient or patient volume coming through pediatrics and family care, which is why you would put something like this out there. Orthopedics, that is flat. It's fairly consistent, but guys have put them in orthopedics too?

**Expert:** Yes.

**Client:** I'm trying to understand are there certain specialties that just wouldn't find this to be valuable at all?

**Expert:** That's hard to say. We don't have all the specialties, but we have some.

**Client:** Yeah. I think maybe just taking a step back, the question I'm trying to answer is, is this technology something that inevitably will be adopted by all specialties, all physician groups, all hospitals, and what are the bottlenecks to that?

**Expert:** Yeah. It could be, but I guarantee you it's not going to be implemented across all multi-specialty. Why? Because some just operate much more leaner, better off with a human element and don't need a solution like this. I just don't see that happening at least in the next even three years. I just don't see that happening.

**Client:** In the Medical Center, all the IT decisions are central. It sounds like there are different specialties within the medical center, but the IT purchasing is an enterprise-wide decision. Correct?

**Expert:** Correct.

**Client:** It sounds like to me yes, some specialties might have a lower scheduling burden, but if it's part of a broader enterprise solution anyway, why not take care and reduce that admin burden for that specialty?

**Expert:** Yes, you're right, but we don't have admin personnel for those particular areas. It's more of an overlap in their working responsibilities. Somebody's doing this job because it's a low volume versus having an FTE there. Let me put it this way, if there's no FTE actually managing this, then we're not going to be putting it over there.

**Client:** Got it. Who manages their schedule then? How do patients schedule with them?

**Expert:** There's a scheduling team.

**Client:** Do you see over time that this could take over the scheduling team?

**Expert:** Not 100%, but to a certain degree, yes. Probably 50%, maybe yeah.
