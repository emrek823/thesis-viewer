## Slide 4: Why Now
### Three market forces driving healthcare data transformation

**Explosion in Data Access**
The 21st Century Cures Act has unleashed unprecedented access to healthcare data, while value-based care partnerships continue to expand available data sources. Organizations now regularly manage 10+ distinct data sources, including multiple streams of claims, EHR, and HIE data. This explosion in data access creates both opportunity and complexity.

**Shift to Modern Data Infrastructure**
Healthcare organizations are abandoning traditional black-box vendor solutions in favor of building their own data platforms on modern infrastructure like Snowflake and Databricks. This shift reflects a growing demand for data control and transparency, as internal data platforms become the industry standard for leading healthcare organizations.

**AI Demands Quality Data**
The AI revolution in healthcare depends critically on high-quality, normalized data foundations. Organizations are discovering that AI applications can only be as good as their underlying data. Tuva provides the essential data layer that transforms raw healthcare data into AI-ready assets, enabling reliable and trusted AI outcomes across the enterprise.

## Slide 5: Problem
### Healthcare data teams waste $1M+ annually wrestling with fragmented, low-quality data

**Healthcare data pain points:**
1.  Multiple sources: Claims, EHR, HIE, Labs
2.  Multiple formats: CSV, JSON, XML, DB, PDF
3.  Persistent quality issues: Missing, invalid, duplicate, referential, implausible values
4.  Missing analytics-ready features

**Result:** Teams spend **80% of time** cleaning vs. analyzing while wasting **$1M+ per year** in resources.

## Slide 6: Problem
### How do you go from 1 million+ codes to analytics-ready concepts?

**Codes (Examples):**
*   SNOMED-CT
*   ICD-10
*   LOINC
*   NDC
*   RxNorm
*   HCPCS
*   Place of Service
*   Revenue Center
*   Bill Type
*   Etc...

**Analytics-Ready Concepts (Examples):**
*   Care Settings
*   Provider Specialties
*   Services
*   Conditions
*   Procedures
*   Encounters
*   Episodes
*   Preventable Events
*   Care Transitions
*   Etc...

## Slide 7: Solution
### Tuva: An open-source platform that transforms raw data into analytics-ready insights

**Normalized**
Common schema unifies claims, EHR, HIE, and lab data

**Quality-tested**
100+ automated atomic and analytic quality tests

**Enriched**
1000+ pre-built clinical concepts enrich raw data for analytics

**Data Flow:**
Raw data sources

Tuva Data Model
⬇️
Advanced analytics

## Slide 8: Data Platform
### Under the hood, we're building an entire data transformation platform that sits on top of our customers' existing data platforms

**Tuva Open-source Data Model Components:**
*   **MapAI:** Structure and normalize data formats and vocabularies
*   **EMPI:** De-duplicate and merge patients across data sources
*   **OntologyAI:** Define and customize clinical and operational concepts
*   **DQI:** Identify atomic and analytic-level data quality problems

**Components above the Data Model:**
*   **AI Apps + Agents:** Build applications and agents to power workflows
*   **Data Network:** Access benchmarking and comparative datasets
*   **Ecosystem:** Access third-party applications and algorithms

**Underlying Infrastructure:**
*   **Cloud:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
*   **Data Warehouse:** snowflake, databricks
*   **Cloud:** dbt, dagster
*   **Business Intelligence:** tableau

## Slide 13: Why Open-source
### Open-source unlocks alternative to build vs. buy paradigm

**Build**
*   **Complex:** Internal teams struggle to hire and retain necessary domain experts to build internally.
*   **Slow:** Can take years (we've spent 30,000+ hours building Tuva so far).

**Hybrid**
*   **Fast:** Advanced analytics in 1-2 weeks.
*   **Full Control:** All inside the customer's cloud so they control their data and infrastructure.
*   **Transparent:** All code is public and is reviewed and improved by the largest healthcare data and analytics community in the world (1500+ members and counting).
*   *Associated Logo:* TUVAHealth

**Buy**
*   **Black-box:** Limited documentation or transparency into the code or methods used to transform data.
*   **No Control:** Customer sends their data to vendor, giving up control of their data and the infrastructure it runs on.
