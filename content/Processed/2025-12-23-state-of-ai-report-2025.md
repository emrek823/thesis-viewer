# STATE OF AI REPORT 2025.

The **State of AI Report** is the most widely read and trusted analysis of key developments in AI. Published annually since 2018, the open-access report aims to spark informed conversation about the state of AI and what it means for the future. Produced by AI investor **[Nathan Benaich](https://www.twitter.com/nathanbenaich)** and **[Air Street Capital](https://www.airstreet.com/portfolio)**.

Now in its eighth year, the **State of AI Report 2025** is reviewed by leading AI practitioners in industry and research. It considers the following key dimensions, including a new large-scale AI usage survey section:1. **Research:** Technology breakthroughs and their capabilities.
2. **Industry:** Areas of commercial application for AI and its business impact.
3. **Politics:** Regulation of AI, its economic implications and the evolving geopolitics of AI.
4. **Safety:** Identifying and mitigating catastrophic risks that highly-capable future AI systems could pose to us.
5. **Survey:** The largest open-access survey of 1,200 AI practitioners and their AI usage patterns. You can  **[participate here](https://www.stateof.ai/survey)**.
6. **Predictions:** What we believe will happen in the next 12 months and a performance review of last year's predictions to keep us honest.

**Key takeways from the 2025 Report include:**:1. **OpenAI retains a narrow lead at the frontier**, but competition has intensified as Meta reliquinshes the mantle to China’s DeepSeek, Qwen, and Kimi close the gap on reasoning and coding tasks, establishing China as a credible #2.
2. **Reasoning defined the year**, as frontier labs combined reinforcement learning, rubric-based rewards, and verifiable reasoning with novel environments to create models that can plan, reflect, self-correct, and work over increasingly long time horizons.
3. **AI is becoming a scientific collaborator**, with systems like DeepMind’s Co-Scientist and Stanford’s Virtual Lab autonomously generating, testing, and validating hypotheses. In biology, Profluent’s ProGen3 showed that scaling laws now apply to proteins too.
4. **Structured reasoning entered the physical world** through “Chain-of-Action” planning, as embodied AI systems such as AI2’s Molmo-Act and Google’s Gemini Robotics 1.5 began to reason step-by-step before acting.
5. **Commercial traction accelerated sharply.** Forty-four percent of U.S. businesses now pay for AI tools (up from 5% in 2023), average contracts reached $530,000, and AI-first startups grew 1.5× faster than peers, according to Ramp and Standard Metrics.
6. **Our inaugural AI Practitioner Survey**, with over 1,200 respondents, shows that 95% of professionals now use AI at work or home, 76% pay for AI tools out of pocket, and most report sustained productivity gains, evidence that real adoption has gone mainstream.
7. **The industrial era of AI has begun.** Multi-GW data centers like Stargate signal a new wave of compute infrastructure backed by sovereign funds from the U.S., UAE, and China, with power supply emerging as the new constraint.
8. **AI politics hardened further.** The U.S. leaned into “America-first AI,” Europe’s AI Act stumbled, and China expanded its open-weights ecosystem and domestic silicon ambitions.
9. **Safety research entered a new, more pragmatic phase.** Models can now imitate alignment under supervision, forcing a debate about transparency versus capability. External safety organizations, meanwhile, operate on budgets smaller than a frontier lab’s daily burn.
10. **The existential risk debate has cooled**, giving way to concrete questions about reliability, cyber resilience, and the long-term governance of increasingly autonomous systems.
