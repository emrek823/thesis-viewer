# Physician Enablement
## Value-Based Care Primer: The Largest ‘Growth’ Sector in Healthcare
### Industry Overview

**World-class companies investing aggressively in the space**
Some of the largest companies in the world, including AMZN and WMT, as well as healthcare giants like UNH, HUM, CVS and WBA (collectively >$2T in enterprise value) will now all share one thing in common: Direct ownership of ‘value-based’ primary care groups. What was once a quiet part of the healthcare system has transformed into the hottest M&A sector in our coverage, with tens of billions spent on acquisitions annually in recent years. Despite strong demand from the corporate side for more deals and expansion of platforms, investors remain skeptical, with standalone public valuations down 40%-80%. While some skepticism is justified, we see a wide spread between corporate and investor expectations. These should narrow as the industry grows, presenting an opportunity in our view. In this 140-page primer we cover the value-based physician sector and explain the dynamics behind what could eventually be the next $2T ‘growth’ industry to emerge from US healthcare and why M&A in the space should continue to increase.

**Rapid growth in spending; potential expansion beyond MA**
Value-based care has been talked about for decades, so why is this time different? 1) The ACA has led to a rise in government-sponsored insurance, which brings standardized reimbursement structures such as a fee schedule (no surprise bills), benchmarking, risk adjustment and MLR caps (pricing floor for providers). 2) Significant advancements in HealthIT infrastructure. 3) Greater focus, particularly on the sickest slice of Medicare patients, full value-based clinics, incorporation of social factors 4) Federal government pushing for 100% value-based care penetration in Medicare by 2030. We estimate $420b of spending is in capitation-like models in 2021, which should grow to $1.9T by 2030 (of which $1.2T is in Medicare alone), representing growth of 21% per year.

**UNH suggests model can generate 15% EBITDA at scale**
While most of the standalone public companies don’t make money on a consolidated basis today, the most compelling demonstration of long-term viability is UNH (see our OptumHealth Primer report) in our view. In 2023, the company will be taking full risk on ~$60b of MA premiums while still operating at ~9% EBITDA margins. UNH acknowledges that mature assets are already generating 15-20% type margins, but growing capitated revenue 25% a year is a drag on earnings. The path to mid-teens EBITDA margins for the standalone companies will be driven by increasing the average maturity of a clinic, as MLR takes 3-4 years to meaningfully ramp from ~100%, dropping to 70-80%, while G&A leverage comes from filling clinics and covering fixed costs.

**Why you should read this report; major themes covered**
We cover the history of the FFS versus VBC, size the opportunity and growth, explain the nuances of reimbursement (including risk adjustment) and why Medicare works best. We also bridge how companies lower MLR and reach target margin, detail cash flow mechanics, provide an overview of key companies in the sector (AGL, CANO, OSH, PRVA and UNH’s OptumHealth), examine transactions and public valuations, discuss possible points of strategic differentiation, and explain insurance accounting.

## Biggest Healthcare Shift in Generations
Capitation models have received significantly more attention from public investors in recent years as a result of accelerating momentum, demand from payers, high profile IPOs within the space and an embrace from the federal government. At its core, these models are about changing provider incentives to focus on cost and quality over quantity of services.

**The problem: Healthcare costs, are growing too quickly**
The portion of US GDP dedicated to health spending has increased dramatically over the past few decades at a pace well above comparable developed countries. In 1970, approximately 6% of the GDP (versus 5% for comparable countries) was dedicated to total health spending through public and private funds. This figure has nearly tripled to 20% in the US for 2020, while comparable countries ‘only’ doubled to 11%.

**The solution: Enabling physicians to drive better outcomes**
From the outside observer, it is clear the current approach to healthcare in the US is unsustainable. At the heart of the recent trend in the physician enablement sector is the idea that healthcare costs can be better managed by providing actionable health information at the point of care through technology and financially incentivizing providers to take better care of patients, allowing them to be more invested in patient outcomes. In particular, recognizing that the primary care physician is the ‘front door’ and as ‘quarterback’ can play a huge role in controlling nearly 100% of downstream healthcare spending of a patient, despite representing just 6% of actual spend.

In this section we will detail the history of healthcare reimbursement models in the US, what led us to this point and the potential path forward. In one sentence, the best possible argument for value-based care can be summarized with a famous Charlie Munger quote (of Berkshire Hathaway):

“Show me the incentive, I’ll show you the outcome” – Charlie Munger.

**Largest healthcare company in the world is focused on capitation**
By far the largest proof point of the value in physician enablement is UNH, the most valuable healthcare company in the world. In fact, UNH’s nearly $500b in enterprise value just surpassed FAANG companies like META’s Facebook for the first time. UNH has been quietly but aggressively building a capitated physician business for over a decade within its OptumHealth segment and at its most recent investor day, it was highlighted as the key growth engine for the overall company (see report). Meanwhile its competitors such as HUM, CVS, WBA and ELV have collectively deployed >$20b annually in acquisitions as they scramble to narrow the lead UNH has created.

**Silicon Valley beginning to enter the market in a bigger way**
Finally, the sector has caught the attention of Silicon Valley, with Amazon entering through its third-largest ever acquisition (behind Whole Foods/MGM Studios) for ONEM Iora and prompted Andersson Horowitz (the largest venture capital firm) to author a report saying that it expects a company in this sector to eventually be the most valuable company in the world, which signals a high likelihood of more venture backed companies coming to market over the next decade.

**Key players span upstarts to $500b companies**
Below we outline the key companies with exposure to physician-based value-based care. Notably, large established insurers such as UNH and HUM already have meaningfully scaled assets within them, but are a relatively small piece of the overall enterprise (although are increasingly important to enterprise growth). Meanwhile, companies such as AGL, CANO and OSH are much smaller in terms of total revenue and market cap but are much more exposed to the theme (nearly 100% of revenue). Finally, we note that companies like CLOV and OSCR have fundamentally different approaches to driving down healthcare costs, either through more targeted incentive payments to physicians or by engaging the consumer directly.

| % Exposure to VBC | 11% | 60% | 4% | 100% | 99% | 95% | 37% | 40% | 4% | 0% |

**Retail pharmacies also getting deeper into the sector**
We note that in addition to the companies outlined above, large retailers such as CVS (through pending acquisition of OSH), WBA (majority stake in VillageMD), Amazon (recently closed the acquisition of ONEM), and Walmart (organically building out clinics in partnership with UNH) have entered the space, all directly employing physicians and actively pushing volumes into value-based care. Interestingly, all four of these companies have a retail pharmacy operation in common and to some degree likely see the value in controlling downstream healthcare costs to help divert volumes back towards owned assets.

**What we’ll cover in this report**
In this report we cover the history of the FFS system, why VBC could work this time, size the opportunity and growth, explain the nuances of reimbursement (including risk adjustment) and why Medicare works best, bridge how companies lower MLR and reach target margin, detail cash flow mechanics, provide an overview of key companies in the sector, examine transactions and public valuations, discuss possible points of strategic differentiation, as well as explain insurance accounting.

**Additionally, we address the most commonly asked questions from investors**
Why focus on Medicare Advantage? Why not Commercial or Medicaid? How exactly do these companies save money? How can they earn a margin on 85% of premium? Why would a Managed Care plan work with them? Why not start their own MCO? Which model is better, owned versus affiliate? Aren’t they just gaming risk codes? How differentiated is the technology? How much regulatory risk is there? What if regulators look to cap profits? What long term competitive advantages / economic moats are there? At what point do we shift from “everyone wins on industry growth” to “these companies start taking share from each other”? Why are the stocks so volatile?

## Fee-for-service history
Part of the increases in healthcare spending across the world can be attributed to aging populations and expensive medical advances, but the US relative underperformance can probably also be explained the excess capacity built into the system to ensure that people who want care, can get it quickly. But a potentially larger explanation is due to the inherent misaligned incentives for providers in the historical “fee for service” reimbursement model.

In a fee for service model, providers earn a fee for every service they perform, creating an incentive to perform more services to maximize revenue. Fee for service neither effectively promotes the elimination of waste nor does it incentivize cost control or quality outcomes. Despite its widely acknowledged deficiencies, it remains the most common payment method in the United States.

**Government originally operated on cost-plus basis**
By way of background, in 1965 the US first established the Medicare and Medicaid programs to care for the elderly and the poor. Interestingly, the primary method for reimbursing providers followed the philosophy of paying the ‘cost’ of delivering each unit of care plus some markup, known as cost-plus. This method was inherently flawed and created the incentive for providers to spend as much as possible, knowing they would get a return on any spending, regardless of the outcome.

**Fee-for-service model created unintended consequences**
While costs under the cost-plus system were audited by the government to ensure they were medically appropriate, the incentive problem it created was too difficult to overcome and costs began to both increase and vary widely across different provider groups for the same services. As a response, in the 1980s the Medicare program began to create standardized fee categories of billing codes and reimbursement rates. Instead of billing for the cost of care provided, providers could now only get reimbursed for “the average cost of an efficient provider” to provide the service. This was an improvement, in that it created an incentive for providers to become more efficient in order to capture a spread between the payment and their costs. However, it did nothing to eliminate the incentive to provide more services.

**Emphasis on volumes to maximize billable events**
Under FFS, physicians and other providers are paid more money if they provide more services, so they often look to provide the highest number of healthcare services. There is an incentive to run more tests and perform more expensive procedures than necessary.

**Over-service makes it hard to gauge ‘true’ costs**
Since providers are generally in the habit of over-prescribing services, the types and volumes of care being used to treat a given disease vary widely and make it difficult to gauge an appropriate cost for a patient or disease state.

**Overabundance of caution from legal threat**
This issue of focusing on volumes can be compounded by the current legal system, which leaves physicians liable for misdiagnosis and drives the practice of defensive medicine. If a provider gets more money to run a test to go from 98% confident in a diagnosis to 100% confident and reduce the likelihood of getting sued, why not order that test, regardless of the cost?

**A lack of focus on quality**
Although we believe that all healthcare providers want to do a good job, their main focus is on what happens at their site of care, with little attention paid to the longer-term clinical outcomes for the patient. In fact, most providers have little data on what happens to patients after they leave their doors. Without the time, resources, or financial incentives to follow patients, there is little reason for physicians to even try to do so. These gaps in care dramatically reduce the overall quality of care and can lead to significant increases in costs.

**A barrier to shifting care to the low-cost setting**
With the focus on quantity, not quality of care, many physician practices bought MRIs and other imaging equipment in an effort to capture more of the economics of the patients that they see. As a result, there is an incentive to use that machine, even if a freestanding imaging center might be a lower cost option. In the end, the patient can receive suboptimal care, pay a higher price, or both.

**Little focus on preventative care.**
The current model is based on treating people after they get sick, and there are few incentives to keep people healthy.

**Value-based care overview**
In response to the rapid growth in healthcare spending and the acknowledgement that it is unsustainable, there has been a move to shift away from fee for service toward fee for value (value-based care or value-based purchasing). There are many different value-based reimbursement models that can be implemented to link financial rewards with clinical performance and cost control. These models range from an FFS base with extra payments for providers who meet quality goals, to a shared-risk framework, all the way to full capitation (passing 100% of underwriting risk from the insurer to the doctor). The main thing they have in common is they incentivize providers to deliver not only top quality care, but also lower costs. Below we walk through what we see as the four major types of value-based care models.

**Exhibit 4: Value-based care is a spectrum of paying for performance and taking downside risk**
Spectrum of advanced payment models by order of risk taking
Source: BofA Global Research, Company Filings

*   **Small % of financial risk**
    *   Fee-for-Service
    *   Performance Contracting (Quality Payments)
*   **Moderate % of financial risk**
    *   Bundled and Episodic Payment
    *   Shared Savings
    *   Shared Risk
*   **Large % of financial risk**
    *   Capitation
    *   Capitation + Performance Contracting

**Quality-linked and bonus payments**
One incremental approach which has been tested has been quality-linked payments. Under these types of arrangements, providers continue to be paid through the FFS model. However, in addition to the base rate, providers would be paid an additional amount for hitting certain quality benchmarks such as completing annual wellness visits to document health status and would potentially be penalized if they do not. In cases where the providers assume some downside, the arrangements typically involve a ‘quality withhold’ payment where the original FFS rate is reduced by some amount (typically ~5%) and only repaid once quality measures are reached in addition to a potential quality bonus. The upside of this arrangement is that it starts to get providers to think about something beyond simply doing more.

**Bonus payments tend to focus on narrow measures, not holistic**
Providers have generally been receptive to quality-linked bonus payments as they are generally seen as upside to the existing contracting rates. While this method of reimbursement helps align incentives to some degree, the reality is that it focuses physicians on a very narrow set of measures which do not necessarily improve health outcomes or lower overall costs as much as more integrated models do.

**Bundled payments focus on the entire episode of care**
Another incremental approach to value-based reimbursement is the concept of bundled payments in which providers are reimbursed on a “pay for episode of care” basis. In a way, this payment method dates back to the 1983 when the Medicare program introduced ‘diagnosis-related group’ (DRG) payments to control costs. Under DRG, the Medicare program classifies certain hospital and surgical procedures into unique categories on the basis of the disease state, treatment, secondary chronic conditions and care intensity such as a lung transplant or treatment for pneumonia. Under DRG, Medicare reimburses a flat fee for each procedure which covers all of the associated billing codes. The main drawback of DRGs is that it still only covers the cost of care while the patient is in the hospital (costs pre and post discharge are covered separately) and only covers the hospital costs, not the related physician spending.

**Bundled-payments expands definition to episodic care**
Following the lead of some insurers in the private market, in 2016 the government introduced ‘bundled’ payments which extends payments to cover care episodes, defined to include all necessary inpatient and outpatient services required to treat a specific injury or illness from the time of diagnosis through recovery. The single fixed fee covers the costs of the physicians and other clinicians, drugs, devices, facilities, and any other resources dedicated to the episode of care.

**Approach encourages collaboration across continuum of care**
This approach incentivizes providers to collaborate across the continuum of care to deliver high-quality, low-cost healthcare. Unfortunately, there is no incentive to focus on preventative care, since the payment begins at the time that the episode starts (after there is already a healthcare issue). However, there is a real incentive to ensure that there are no gaps in care when a patient moves from one care setting to the next during recovery. The bundled payment rate is based on the average cost of an episode, so providers can make money by keeping spending below the bundled rate, but would be at risk if costs go above the rate.

**Ultimately, bundles still incentivize more volumes**
While the bundled payment approach does encourage more value-oriented care within a case bundle, it creates no durable incentive for the provider group to lower overall medical costs. Instead, it still encourages groups to push a greater number of bundles or procedures to maximize revenue even if it adds no value or even harms the patient.

**Shared savings/shared risk**
A more advanced form of value-based care approaches are called shared savings and risk arrangements. Shared savings and risk arrangements are more in-line with how people generally think about value-based care in that providers are assigned a number of enrollees and there is a benchmark spending target for that pool of members for which the provider must manage down costs.

**Providers still paid fee-for-service but reconcile savings at end of period**
Unlike full risk arrangements where providers are paid the full rate each month, in shared risk providers are usually paid on a fee for service basis during the period. However, at the end of the period, actual spending is compared against the benchmark level of spending and if there are savings, the providers share a percentage of the upside (net of any fee for service spending).

**Can be structured for different levels of risk, more risk more reward**
Shared savings can be structured as “one-way risk” models (where there is upside if costs are below the benchmark, but no penalties if costs are above the benchmark) or “two-way risk” models (where providers share in the upside if costs come in below the benchmark and the downside if costs come in above the benchmark). Two way risk models usually share a greater percentage of the upside in return for taking risk to the downside.

**Makes it easier for provider to join as it limits downside, offers ‘glide path’**
Given that shared savings are definitionally dividing risk among multiples parties, it can be seen as a way for a provider group to get on boarded to the concept of taking financial risk without being on the hook for outsized downside. Meanwhile, if the provider joins a shared risk arrangement with just minimal downside risk, as the provider gets comfortable in the results, the provider can slowly increase the amount of risk it is taking on as a ‘glide path’ into risk taking.

**Awkward middle ground of risk taking may not support investment**
One potential downside of shared savings / risk is that the portion of the upside may not justify additional investment into the infrastructure needed to make it work for the provider. Said another way, if a provider is willing to invest into the care management infrastructure and sophistication needed (which can involve shifting the entire way of operating the practice) to feel confident that it can control medical costs then having to share the upside it expects with another party reduces the return on investment and makes it harder to justify even if there is minimal downside.

**Full risk or “capitation”**
The most advanced form of value-based care a provider can enter into is a full risk, or capitation (derived from “per capita”) arrangement. Under capitation, providers are paid a fixed payment per each enrollee per month, regardless of the services that the enrollee receives. If the provider can keep the costs below the capitated rate, then it makes money, while if costs go above the capitated rate, it loses money. Essentially, the managed care payer is fully offloading risk onto the provider. There are various types of capitation arrangements:

*   **Global or full capitation:** A provider operates under a global capitation model if it is reimbursed on a per-member per-month basis (PMPM) to cover the entire range of healthcare services. In this model, historic data is used to project future costs and rates for services (eg paying the provider more for a patient with multiple chronic conditions than for a patient who is relatively healthy).
*   **Partial capitation:** A provider operates under a partial or blended capitation model if it receives capitated reimbursements only for certain types of services – eg, physician specialists.
*   **Sub capitation:** This is the process where one provider takes risk on a broad set of services and then pays a PMPM to another provider to provide a subset of services (eg a provider taking global cap might sub capitate to an orthopedic physician group through a partial capitation contract to cover orthopedic costs).

**A focus on number of enrollees, not number of services.**
A traditional fee for service (FFS) model incentivizes hospitals and other providers to provide more services or raise their prices in order to increase revenue and generate a profit. Under FFS, serving sick patients is in the strategic interest of for-profit providers since these patients require the most care. Capitation incentivizes providers to implement preventative measures to control healthcare utilization. Under this model, reducing costs for care and limiting unnecessary services is in the strategic interest of providers. By delivering care in the most efficient and cost-effective way, providers are able to attract enrollees and generate a consistent stream of revenue.

**Places the provider in the driver seat of care**
In a FFS model, the insurer serves as the primary risk-bearing entity. Under capitation, utilization risk shifts from payers to providers, because providers are paid a fixed reimbursement based on the number of enrollees, regardless of the cost of care. This framework encourages physicians and other healthcare professionals to carefully consider each dollar spent on patients, but it also encourages them to spend money on prevention, rather than simply treating patients after they get sick. The thought process is that the care giver is the person closest to the patient and therefore best able to make the correct call about the most cost-effective setting for care.

**Incentivizes cost controls, long term investment into preventative care**
All of the incentives under fee-for-service are directed toward the doctor performing more services. For example, the choice for the doctor about whether to perform another test becomes relatively simple: run an extra test, provide some protection against a potential malpractice liability, and bill additional revenue. Under integrated care models, the incentives are to control costs, so an incremental test is more likely to be run by the doctor if there is true diagnostic benefits from doing so. This model could incentivize a short-term reduction in services in order to hit a bonus target. However, if physicians are routinely denying care, eventually, the patient will have a healthcare issue that needs to be treated in a high-cost setting. As a result, although there is a short-term incentive to restrict care, there is a long-term incentive to focus on preventative medicine and to spend a modest amount of money today to avoid a costly health issue tomorrow.

**Lower institutional care the main driver of savings, therefore not a conflict**
Integrated care arrangements with doctors allow MCOs to incentivize keeping patients out of higher cost institutional care settings (eg hospitals, nursing homes, etc). Physicians represent about 30% of total healthcare spending, with primary care only about a fifth of that so they are essentially saying to physicians that they will pay them more if they help them lower the medical costs on the other 70% of medical costs. MCOs and physicians win under this relationship – medical costs are lower for MCOs and physicians earn more money without cannibalizing their own businesses. Notably, for dual eligible patients (the sickest slice of Medicare patients), physicians only represent 18% of spending, meaning they can drive down costs on the other 82%.

| Other Physicians (Non-PCP + Home Health) | 15%        |
| Primary Care               | 3%         |

**Adjusting payments based on demographic factors**
In most cases, the capitated amount will be risk adjusted to ensure that providers are not disincentivized from taking the high-risk patients. These payments are usually adjusted based on the demographic characteristics, such as age and gender, or the expected costs of the members based on the chronic conditions that these patients have.

The most common chronic conditions for the FFS Medicare population include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes. According to a county-level study conducted by USA Today, two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries have two or more chronic conditions. HHS defines a chronic condition as a physical, mental, or cognitive condition that lasts at least one year and requires ongoing medical attention and/or limits daily activities. According to CMS, people with multiple chronic conditions are more likely to require visits to the doctor, emergency room services, home health visits, post-acute services and other medical arrangements. CMS now pays clinicians more within the FFS program when they deal with patients with two or more chronic conditions.

As a result, in order to match payments with expected average costs, a capitated provider will be paid more to care for a patient that is sicker than average and would be paid less than average to care for a patient who is healthier than average. The key here is that the rate is based on expected average cost for a patient with those characteristics, creating a financial incentive for the provider to lower costs below average.

**Critics say providers are incentivized to reduce care**
Some healthcare leaders make the argument that physicians and other clinicians should be focused only on clinical outcomes. They raise concerns that pressure on the healthcare providers to make the right financial decisions could come at the expense of the health of their patients. For example, a doctor may forgo performing a certain necessary procedure or conducting a necessary test based on the costs. More generally, capitation could hurt the physician-patient relationship as they have competing interests in mind. However, we note that short-term thinking by a provider usually results in larger healthcare issues (and spending) down the road, so high performing providers understand that they need to avoid the temptation of short-term gains.

**Difficulty in penetrating new markets, shift behavior**
There is a wide variation in acceptance (and success) of capitation by geography, in general California, Florida and Texas are the most advanced in providers accepting capitation payments. Meanwhile, other regions such as the Northeast and Midwest are far less penetrated. This gets to the issue of being able to engage with a provider and truly shift their mindset away from fee for service to fee for value. As a market begins to embrace capitated models, the next generation of doctors grow up in that model and it becomes further solidified as a core payment mechanism. However, first getting to that point can be difficult.

**Past capitation efforts had mixed results**
In the past, a similar capitated payment model was implemented in the 1990s under the ‘HMO’ (Health Maintenance Organization) model which failed to sustainably improve care delivery and payment. Under the old system, some of the risk management responsibilities shifted from payers to providers. Meanwhile, insurers began to implement a ‘gatekeeper’ approach which required patients to see a primary care doctor first, to obtain a referral to see specialists, diagnostics, surgeries or even hospitalizations. Additionally, insurance companies implemented stringent prior authorization requirements, leading to delayed and denied care. Ultimately, patients accused doctors and insurers of rationing care.

Providers, especially small healthcare organizations, were ill-prepared and unable to take on the newfound financial risk, but signed the contracts in order to gain share and drive patients to their hospitals (still under the mindset of “do anything you can to fill your bed”). Even larger systems often failed to develop sustainable risk management practices. Meanwhile, other providers failed to change practice patterns, and running capitation with a fee for service mindset (ie the more you do, the better it is) will quickly lead to losses. As a result of the inability to predict risk and control costs, providers largely rejected the capitated model and returned to fee for service. The percentage of physician visits under capitation declined from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.

## Why should it work this time?
Despite past failures, capitation payment models as a way to pay for physicians have again accelerated in recent years. In our view, there are a number of key differences today which make the approach more sustainable.

**A focus on the sickest patients, better microeconomics**
Unlike the broad-based approach of the 1990’s HMO model, most of the new adoption of capitation arrangements today is on a more targeted basis towards the sickest patients with the greatest opportunity to drive savings. Since the savings are on a higher dollar amount of spending, the greater focus also drives better microeconomics by providing a meaningful gross dollar margin opportunity at the patient level, which is generally enough to shift behavior away from fee for service.

**The older, the costlier. Sickest patients represent most of the spending.**
MedPAC’s statistics show that older enrollees represent a disproportionate amount of spending. For example, beneficiaries >85 represent 15% of spend but just 11% of enrollment while 65-74 represents 37% of spend but 49% of enrollment. Older patients are more prone to injuries and illnesses and are more likely than others to require care for multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.

Meanwhile, setting aside age, the top 10% of costly beneficiaries represent 60% of Medicare program spending. Essentially this implies that in order to address healthcare spending, efforts should be focused on addressing the needs of the sickest members rather than an approach catered to the average.

| Next 5% | 5% | 18% |
| Next 4% | 4% | 27% |
| Most expensive 1% | 1% | 15% |

**Government programs have highest spending per member**
Unsurprisingly, members in government programs (Focused on seniors/low-income populations) have significantly higher spending per member. This is because qualifying for Medicare and Medicaid are based on age (older seniors are typically sicker) as well as acuity (persons with disabilities). Therefore, spending on a Medicaid/Medicare member can be 50%-100% higher than the average person on employer coverage. This is especially meaningful given that the unit cost rates in commercial are about 250% of Medicare, implying that utilization in Medicare is 4x+ higher than commercial.

| CHIP | $3,112 | $259 |
| Employer | $6,213 | $518 |
| Direct Purchase | $4,955 | $413 |

**Growth in government programs brings standardization**
Meanwhile, another key industry development over the last 30 years is the growth of government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid due to the Affordable Care Act and aging population, which together now cover about 1/2 of the population. Alongside the rise of the government programs, there has been a simultaneous growth in the rate at which those programs are outsourced to private industry. Today, nearly 1/2 of Medicare beneficiaries (Medicare Advantage) and more than 3/4 of Medicaid beneficiaries (Managed Medicaid) are served by private insurers (but ultimately paid for by the taxpayer).

**Private market plans (particularly in the 90s) had high variability**
This explosion in privately managed government programs plays a critical role in the success of value-based care for a variety of reasons, which we comb through in more detail throughout this report. At a high level, the most significant factor is the standardization of reimbursement. In private insurance markets, especially in the 90’s (before the Affordable Care Act), there was little standardization between plan designs. Benefit design, robustness of networks, and rates paid to providers varied wildly between insurers; meanwhile premiums for individuals were negotiated in private with little transparency. Because of this, premiums and healthcare costs for individuals had a very high degree of variability, even between beneficiaries with similar demographics. Since a provider’s patient panel would be comprised of patients across a variety of insurers, the variability in premiums and costs would be very difficult to manage. In contrast, today’s capitation largely happens in MA, where benefits and rates are much more standardized.

**Benchmarking approach in government smooths premiums**
Today however, most full-risk value-based care contracts are made within government program constructs. The premiums an insurer receives (and therefore the rate a provider would receive to manage risk) are determined by a transparent government calculation referred to as a benchmark. By having a benchmarking approach to reimbursement, there is much less variability year to year and between beneficiaries.

Of greater importance, these benchmarks are generally calculated by looking at average beneficiary costs within the unmanaged government fee for service program. This creates a relatively low bar against which to generate savings. This is in contrast to commercial capitation in the 90’s where premiums are based on HMO’s ability to manage costs, so doctors who receive 85% of those premiums have to further drive savings beyond what the MCO was able to generate in order to carve out a margin. While by no means impossible, the bar was higher, making it more difficult for physicians trying to change their model to create returns.

At the same time, plans can drive the same relative level of savings every year to maintain profitability. In the case of privately negotiated commercial plans, if an insurer drives down costs, the employer group would likely expect to pay the insurance company a lower amount of premiums in the following year to reflect that, meaning that the provider would have to find incremental savings every year just to maintain margins.

**Meanwhile, standardized benefits, networks, rates smooths costs**
In contrast to the commercial market, these programs have more government mandated guidelines with more standardized benefits, networks, and rates paid to providers, meaning there is also less variability in the costs associated with treating patients with the same demographics.

**Better mechanisms for risk adjustment further matches revenue to costs**
When insurance companies take risk, the aggregate spending averages to be a predictable amount due to the law of large numbers, as the sickest members are offset by relatively healthy members who each pay the same premiums. The larger the membership base, the more likely this is to be true. However, provider panels are significantly smaller than insurance company enrollment and are much more at risk of higher-than-expected costs due to adverse selection (the potential that you will high a disproportionately higher percentage of high cost patients).

To prevent providers from avoiding sick patients, government programs like Medicare Advantage have a mechanism called ‘risk adjustment’ to pay insurers and risk-taking providers more to treat sicker patients (since they have higher expected medical claims). These risk adjustment models are increasingly common in Medicaid programs but are much less prevalent in commercial.

**Quality measures act as guardrails for bad outcomes**
Aside from the direct financial incentive of generating savings, one additional mechanism that most value-based care programs have in place to ensure that providers don’t withhold necessary care is quality metrics. Essentially, programs such as MA codify specific quality metrics such as a percentage of annual wellness visits, medication adherence, cancer screenings, vaccinations and other leading indicators that providers need to manage towards in order to qualify for bonuses or receive full payment.

**Greater appreciation for social determinations of health**
In the past 30 years a greater appreciation for how the ‘social determinants of health’ influence healthcare spending. Essentially, the healthcare community is increasingly recognizing that healthcare outcomes are dynamic and not based solely on what is decided in a clinical setting (such as medications or medical history). For example, access to housing, nutritious meals, transportation to the doctor, financial assistance programs such as food stamps, a gym, or to mental health resources are all becoming recognized as important inputs to keeping a patient healthy.

**Government has begun to pay for more social services**
Additionally, government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are supporting the role of social determinants of health by paying for some of them, therefore allowing risk-taking providers to play the role of routing patients to these necessary and outcome changing services and gives the providers more tools at their disposal.

**By coordinating benefits, provider can increase adherence, patient satisfaction**
Finally, it’s worth noting that these perks and resources are generally available to many of the beneficiaries capitated providers treat, but the patients are often unaware that they exist. With value-based care, providers now have an incentive to ensure patients are receiving all of these available resources which increases medical adherence in general (As a patient cannot seek care without transportation or stable mental condition) as well as increases the perceived value of the service from a patient’s perspective (as the patient receives all of these additional benefits after visiting the provider even though the provider isn’t paying for the services).

**Advancement in healthcare technology**
Another issue with capitation in the 1990s, is that providers did not have the technology to fully understand their own costs and were unable to predict whether the capitated rate that they received would be enough. Meanwhile, providers in a fee for service world, sit in their office and wait for patients to come to them with health issues. They never built out the capabilities or technology to identify patients at high risk of a health issue in advance, because it was not necessary under a fee for service model. A lack of sophistication in understanding how to price risk and how to first identify and then engage with high risk populations, is one of the biggest gating factors to widespread capitation. Since then, there has been a proliferation of HealthIT technology and greater interoperability initiatives which give the provider greater access to the relevant data needed to manage risk.

**Dedicated models, physicians more focused**
A more straightforward reason practices may be more successful in value-based care this time around is the proliferation of groups focused exclusively on this opportunity. By remaining focused on a specific model of care and reimbursement the physician is going to be more effective at driving outcomes. Intuitively this makes sense, as it would be difficult for a physician on hand to treat a subsect of patients under fee-for-service (Where the incentive would be to bill for as many services as possible) and simultaneously treat other patients under value-based care (where the incentive is to bill for fewer services and prevent costly hospitalizations). Taking this even one step further, many companies are focusing exclusively on seniors, which makes it even easier for physicians to execute on a standardized treatment model than if the doctor were to pivot from an 18 year old male, to a 30 year old pregnant woman to an 85 year old male.

**“Field of dreams” model aligns financial incentives**
Finally, if we return to the concept of “incentives drive outcomes”, potentially the single biggest driver that supports this shift is the introduction of the Minimum Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirement as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA implemented minimum MLR of 80-85% for health plans depending on the product (individual and small group commercial at 80% and MA and large group commercial at 85%), essentially capping health insurance gross profits at 15-20%. Essentially, insurers are now required to spend 80-85% of all premium dollars on healthcare costs. If the MLR falls below this level, the MCO rebates the difference back to the customer.

**Minimum MLR aligns incentives of the MCO**
This minimum MLR creates a number of dynamics that encourages capitation to doctors. First, it creates an easy payment reference point for providers to assume risk. Second, it creates an incentive for the MCO to capitate at the minimum MLR as it maximizes their own gross profit while offloading all of its risk. Third, since payments are risk adjusted based on the health status of the patient, it ensures that the doctor will work to fully document the patient’s health, resulting in higher revenue to the MCO (and the doctor who gets 85% of that MA premium). Fourth, since MCOs receive bonus payments for high quality (and doctors get 85% of that amount), it incentivizes physicians to focus on hitting quality targets. From the point of view of the MCO, this maximizes revenue (through higher risk scoring and quality bonuses), while locking in maximum margins on that higher revenue and eliminates direct exposure to fluctuations in cost trend. As a result, if an insurer can build a physician network who can control costs, risk score and deliver quality, then membership will come.

**If the provider can manage costs, they can more than double profitability**
Normally a primary care provider would only get paid when they see the patient (1-2x per year), without any regard for what happens outside the walls of the clinic. However, under value-based care the provider gets paid as a percentage of premiums and can increase their earnings by focusing on controlling patient costs. If the provider is successful, shifting to value based care can increase revenue by more than 11x, and profitability by 2-4x+ (see Economic model, margins) Therefore, under value-based care when MCOs win, the physician business wins too.

## Sizing the growth and opportunity

## Sizing the opportunity to manage trillions
The US as of 2022 spent about $3.7T on delivering healthcare, and this is expected to continue growing 5-6% per year. Therefore, the theoretical opportunity for value-based care and physician enablement is to manage all of that spending and earn a margin on the savings. Given that fee-for-service is still the predominant form of payment for healthcare spending today, there is a large penetration opportunity in converting more physicians towards value-based care. Moving towards greater penetration, focusing on higher growth subsectors such as Medicare Advantage, alongside forecasted growth in healthcare spending gives us confidence the industry of value-based care / physician enablement can easily grow 20%+ for the next decade.

**Growth driven by large secular/demographic tailwinds**
In this section we will walk through the building blocks of how we think about the industry growth rate, which in general is driven by population growth, change in the number of people with insurance (for example the number of seniors is growing from aging demographics, while the number of seniors treated in Medicare Advantage as a % of the total is also growing, accelerating growth), growth in unit costs, and further penetration into value based care.

((Population Growth * Change in number of people with insurance) * (Growth in unit costs)) * Penetration in value-based models = Industry Growth Rates

**Focus on MA, seniors power growth**
**Baby boomers drive MA membership CAGR to 5%+**
While overall population growth in the US is <1% today, modern day capitated physician models are generally more focused on a specific subset of the population where the model works best, specifically Medicare Advantage (MA). Driven by the Baby Boomers, Medicare enrollment will be growing about 2-3% over the next 10 years. The people now turning 65 have a long history of getting their healthcare through managed care, and this should increasingly contribute to higher penetration of MA within the Medicare program. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) now sees penetration going to 56% by 2031, driving a 7.3% membership CAGR over the next 5 years and 5.4% through 2031.

**CBO projects 6% membership CAGR through 2031, higher in near term**

**Pricing pushes total MA spending growth to 9%**
On top of enrollment growth, the rate update that MA plans receive is based on cost growth in the Medicare FFS program. Cost trend in the overall Medicare program has averaged about 3.7% since 2005 and has been as high as 5.0% in recent years. Coupling 5% Medicare Advantage enrollment CAGR that the government expects through 2031 with 4% annual pricing (unit cost) updates, bridges to a roughly 9% MA spending CAGR.

**Increasing penetration pushes CAGR to 20%**
As noted above, there are a number of reasons that MCOs would like to push a greater number of members into capitation arrangements. Therefore, as the number of Medicare Advantage enrollees grow, and spending grows, the percentage of MA members in these arrangements also continues to expand, pushing growth even higher.

**~24% MA penetration today could go to >50% by 2030**
While this data is not centrally reported, we built a bottom-up analysis on 12 of the largest, most well-known companies in the space to back into the minimum current penetration rate in MA and prospects for future growth. Based on actual disclosures today (summing all the reported and estimated membership) we estimate that at least 24% of Medicare Advantage is in fully capitated arrangements as of 2022. Taking this further, we also leveraged our models (for the companies we cover) and LT company guidance to bridge enrollment to 2030. Based on our analysis of these 12 companies, we estimate the total penetration to grow to >50% by 2030.

**HUM disclosures provide reasonable sanity check, 33% upper bound**
As a sanity check, HUM discloses some interesting metrics around the proliferation of value based care in Medicare Advantage. As the 2nd largest MA plan, its own membership experience is somewhat representative of overall industry trends. Since 2016 the penetration of its individual MA members in some form of shared risk is roughly 33% however MA itself has grown significantly during that time and so the membership in shared risk has grown at a 10% CAGR for HUM. Notably, HUM is one of the most advanced at shifting members into capitation we’d expect less sophisticated peers to follow more aggressively and off a lower base. Meanwhile, this broad definition of shared risk is not necessarily full capitation arrangements, leaving more room for HUM to expand. Therefore the 33% HUM talks about it likely above the higher end of where the industry penetration rate is today, making our 24% estimate feel about right.

**Key Assumptions:**
It’s worth outlining the key assumptions in our bottom-up model. 1) Numbers in blue have been explicitly given by the company 2) Black numbers are our estimates 3) UNH’s forward estimates are based on the guidance that they expect to eventually grow to cover 50% of their insured UnitedHealthcare lives from ~20% today, and we assume external lives grow at 2/3 that rate. In that, we assume UnitedHealthcare’s Medicare Advantage business grows in-line with the industry 4) We assume all of Kaiser’s Medicare Advantage enrollment is self-capitated, given that is the focus of the company, and that they grow in line with the MA industry. 5) For HUM, AGL, OSH, CANO, PRVA and VillageMD we use previously published BofA estimates based on company LT guidance 6) For CMAX, ONEM, PIII, and Aledade we use company commentary as well as the blended average growth rates of other companies mentioned here to model forward enrollment. 7) Finally, we assume that the 12 companies mentioned here represent 80% of capitated MA enrollment, meaning that the ‘other’ line covers the remaining 20%.

**Plenty of room (for now) for every company here to achieve long-term growth targets**
Even at seemingly aggressive growth rates for some companies outlined above, the ending penetration rate is still only about 50% by 2030 because MA is also growing well during this time. Therefore, there is room for all of these companies to achieve their long-term growth targets without necessarily needing to out compete each other for market share.

**All-in this would take $111b of 2022 MA spending in capitation to $470b**
Therefore, this expanding penetration rate more than doubles the 9% MA spending growth CAGR to 20% through 2030, taking $111b of MA spending in capitation in 2022 to $470b by 2030 (if penetration reached 51%).

**UNH by far largest, but competition is increasing**
By far the largest company in the sector is UNH serving 3.2m MA lives in capitated arrangements as of 2022 (expecting to grow to 4m in 2023), which on our calculation implies 44% market share. The only other company approaching anywhere near the scale of UNH is Kaiser (17% share), a non-profit healthcare system focused on vertically integrated care. Given Kaiser’s vertically integrated approach, it essentially already has 100% penetration in value-based care on its insured Medicare Advantage membership (both UNH and Kaiser are also insurance companies in addition to being provider groups). From there, public companies like AGL (4%), HUM (3%), OSH (2%), CANO (2%) ONEM (1%), CMAX (1%), PIII (1%), have just single digit market share, while we would expect the 20% ‘other bucket’ to comprise of dozens if not hundreds of smaller entities.

**Penetration in VBC varies widely by geography**
Given that most capitated risk models are focused on the Medicare Advantage population today and there is an uneven split of MA patients throughout the country (due to demographics within each state and the adoption of MA plans), we thought it made sense to show capitated provider payments as a % of MA spending (as opposed to total spending). When looking at things this way it is clear CA and MI are capitating more than just MA spending (as the percentages are over 100%). However, other states such as FL begin to appear as further along the spectrum than they initially screened when looking at total payments.

**Original Medicare expands opportunity**
Most publicly traded capitation models today talk about treating senior patients through Medicare Advantage, but the physicians that work with also tend to treat large amounts of seniors covered under Original Medicare or Medicare FFS (directly by the government). The shift of these patients from Medicare FFS to MA is part of the growth algorithm, but there is the potential for this to accelerate as the government is increasingly looking to bring value-based care concepts into the FFS program. These new payment models materially broaden the total addressable market for capitated physicians’ groups and allows them to have a single value-based care strategy for all of its senior patients.

**MSSP a glide path to risk on Medicare FFS**
The Affordable Care Act created a way for providers to take some form of risk on Medicare FFS patients. At a high level, in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP), a provider contracts directly with the government on Original Medicare beneficiaries with the goal of lowering medical expenses by improving outcomes, treating patients more holistically and sharing in the savings. Providers are paid on their ability to save money versus an established historical spending benchmark, with various levels of upside/downside risk depending on the track the provider wants to take. In general a provider would start by taking no downside but with the opportunity to earn 40% of shared savings as upside, from there the provider can progress until they are taking 75% upside/downside risk.

| E | 75% | 75% | 15% | 2% | 8% |
| Enhanced | 75% | 75% | 20% | 4% | 8% |

**ACO REACH opportunity is similar to MA**
CMS’s latest initiative to move providers towards value-based care is a demonstration program initially called Direct Contracting but since rebranded to ACO REACH. In essence, the demonstration program, which launched in early 2021 is much more similar to Medicare Advantage in design than MSSP, but instead of using an MCO, the federal government directly capitates risk to providers. This new opportunity helps make the Medicare FFS opportunity more attractive for a wider range of physicians.

**Bi-partisan support adds to longer-term visibility**
Interestingly, the Direct Contracting demonstration was started under the Republican Trump administration meaning that the Democrat Biden administration which inherited it had to decide if they wanted to continue running it. After a couple months of uncertainty and calls from far left of the party to dismantle the program, the Biden administration decided to largely maintain most of the architecture of the program and renamed it ‘ACO REACH’. To us, this signals the bi-partisan nature of finding solutions to lower costs in the healthcare system and seeing capitated physicians specifically as a viable means to that end. Much of healthcare services in the US hinges on the regulatory environment being supportive, and therefore the stamp of approval from both sides of the aisle adds significant longer-term visibility.

**CMS wants 100% of Medicare FFS lives in risk by 2030**
Recently, CMS (the main regulatory body in healthcare services) has doubled down on its commitment to value-based care, setting a goal of having almost all Medicare members in ‘accountable’ arrangements by 2030, as well as majority of Medicaid members. To do this, CMS will streamline its portfolio of payment models and benchmarking strategies as they are overlapping and overly complicated, will support and invest in less sophisticated provider groups, and give more transparency, all to ‘maximize participation’ from providers. Additionally, there is a particular focus on total cost of care models, which are essentially full capitation or shared risk arrangements.

**Government sees 9% enrollment CAGR in value-based Original Medicare**
Unlike Medicare Advantage, for Original Medicare,the government has already quantified the penetration of value-based care models today (44% of enrollment in 2021) and has outlined the expected trajectory (60% by 2024, 65% by 2025, 100% by 2030). Using this data, and disclosures on ACO REACH / Medicare Shared Savings specifically, we try to forecast what enrollment in Original Medicare models could look like in the coming decade. Essentially, we assume ACO REACH will grow to a similar scale of MSSP and ‘other’ arrangements will grow relatively slowly as ACO REACH/MSSP are the type of ‘full risk’ models the government is pushing most aggressively. We note that despite the growth in the senior population, we have Original Medicare members flat as MA continues to gain share versus Original Medicare.

**Trajectory implies 14% CAGR on $249b of Original Medicare spending**
Using the estimates outlined above on enrollment penetration, and overlaying government estimates for Original Medicare spending growth, the trajectory implies a 14% CAGR on spending on Original Medicare accountable care models (10% enrollment, 4% cost trend). To help put this in context, it represents growth from $249b in spending in 2022 to $690b in 2030.

**In aggregate, value-based Medicare growing 16% CAGR**
When combining both the Medicare Advantage (20%) and Original Medicare (14%) growth opportunities, in aggregate Medicare capitated and value-based models should grow at a 16% CAGR through 2030. Although together MA/Original Medicare are growing more slowly, the aggregate value of spending is much larger, representing just $361b in spending in 2022 which could grow to $1.2T in 2030. This would imply a penetration rate of 38% in 2022 shifting to 72%.

To be clear, in this analysis, we do not assume that all of MA moves to a capitated model by 2030, resulting in 28% of spending in Medicare being paid to doctors on a fee for service basis, with all of that amount in the MA program. To the extent that Traditional Medicare moves 100% of payments in this direction, adoption within MA could be even faster than this base case.

At the same time, today’s Original Medicare value-based models are largely hospital driven, whereas the growth in new programs appears more likely to be physician driven. If we look purely at the projected growth in the physician component, the CAGR would be higher.

**Could eventually expand beyond Medicare**
While the Medicare market is already a large, fast-growing industry, it is still only about 26% of overall healthcare spending. In many ways, the Medicare market is the most attractive due to its demographic tailwinds, greater opportunity to medically manage patients, and positive reimbursement dynamics. However, once physicians are able to accept and manage capitated risk and see the value in the model it would follow that the eventual opportunity is to cover 100% of total healthcare spending, starting with Medicaid (another 21% of spend) and Commercial insurance (another 32%+).

**Medicaid the most likely ‘next step’, after Medicare**
Medicaid (another 21% of healthcare spending) would be the next most logical target market for capitated physician groups to go after. In particular managing the higher acuity, higher cost patients within Medicaid (those in the Aged, Blind Disabled and Long-term Support Services categories) which would have a similar chronic condition profile to Medicare. Meanwhile, many of the reimbursement dynamics from Medicare Advantage is also somewhat true for Managed Medicaid in certain states.

**Dual eligible already being capitated at scale**
The criteria for Medicare coverage is based on age and disability while Medicaid is based on income and disability and so people can be eligible for both programs (these people are known as dual eligibiles). These members tend to be the sickest patients with the highest costs and are therefore the best target demographic for capitated physician models (higher medical spending to manage means more revenue, more cost save opportunities.) CANO and OSH, two of the largest independent publicly traded physician companies focused on seniors have disclosed that as much as 40% of their membership are dually eligible members (versus only ~20% of the total Medicare population is dual eligible).

**Overall penetration (<14%) in capitation today**
Given that the nature of value-based arrangements are private dealings between insurance companies and providers, there isn’t much publicly available data on the extent of capitation. However, the statutory filings that insurers are legally required to file in each state does provide some insight. Deep within those filings, insurers categorize payments made to providers into various buckets ranging from fee-for-service to full capitation. Overall, we analyzed nearly $800b of claims data which we estimate covers 70-75% of all payments insurers would be required to file. Notably, the data would exclude self-insured employers (covered by ERISA and do not file reports) as well as payments made directly by the federal government to providers.

**14% of payments currently in capitation-like arrangement, stable over time**
Based on our analysis combing through the various categories of claims, we estimate just 14% of total private spending in 2021 was in a capitation-style arrangement. Of note, that percentage dropped from 19% in 2001 to 11% by 2008 as the capitation arrangements of the 1990’s unwound. It remained relatively flat at 11% for the next 7 years, but went from 11% of spending in 2015 to 14% in 2021. Over this same time period, bonus payments went from 4% of spending to 11%, demonstrating how new payment models have started to accelerate.

**Since data excludes self-insured employers, penetration likely lower than 14%**
Given the fact that this data does not include self-insured employers, which represent more than 1/3 of all covered lives in the US, the actual penetration rate is likely even lower than 14% and we estimate is likely closer to 11% of spending. The lower penetration in commercial is because the payment mechanisms in commercial make it harder to do value-based care (no standardized benchmark, no risk adjustment, low acuity population, wider networks).

**Data implies just $34b in spend in Commercial/Medicaid**
Using the data from our analysis above, we estimate that just $112b of private market spending is in a capitated arrangement in 2021. We note that in the Medicare section we estimated that $78b of capitated payments was related to Medicare Advantage (the $213b related to Original Medicare would not get captured in statutory capital filings), implying that the remainder ($112b - $78b) or $34b are capitation payments in Commercial/Medicaid. If we assign the $34b equally to both Commercial and Medicaid, it implies that just 1% of commercial spending and 2% of Medicaid spending were in capitated physician arrangements in 2021.

Taking this a step further, below we show a scenario that highlights our Medicare estimates from earlier while also assuming both Commercial and Medicaid slowly ramp their penetration rates to 25% by 2030. For all ‘other’ spending (other smaller government programs like veteran’s programs) and standalone Part D we assume 0% penetration.

**$420b industry could grow to $1.9T, 21% CAGR**
Altogether, based on our statutory capital analysis and Medicare penetration assumptions, we estimate that in aggregate capitation represents just 11% of healthcare spending in 2022 which we could see ramping to 34% in 2030. In absolute dollar terms this would shift $420b worth of capitation payments to $1.9T, growing at a 21% CAGR.

**Strong demand from MCOs and patients**
**‘Field of dreams’ model, if they build it, MCOs will come**
Patients have little insight into the cost/benefit of healthcare services and managed care companies are one step removed from the patient’s bed side, so incentivizing doctors, who have the best understanding of the patient’s needs, to think about the most cost-effective services while also incentivizing quality has the greatest potential to reduce costs and improve outcomes. Additionally, capitating away the risk of a member to a provider aligns most of the key incentives insurers have with the physician.

1.  **Maximize Gross Profit** By passing risk to a provider an MCO is able to maximize its own gross profit by paying the doctor 85% of premiums which is the minimum medical loss ratio mandated by the government.
2.  **Incentivize better coding** Now that the provider is getting paid as a % of premiums, the doctor has more incentive to document health status and risk code which now gets splits 15% to the MCO and 85% to the provider.
3.  **Rewards higher quality scores** Since quality scores in Medicare Advantage are also tied to premiums and the provider is getting paid a % of premiums, they are now incentivized to achieve higher quality scores.
4.  **Improves plan retention** Finally, if a patient is truly engaged by a key provider (such as a PCP) that patient is less likely to switch health insurers and risk losing their network, increasing retention.

**HUM highlights value of shifting to risk, MCOs demanding it**
At their investor day in 2021 HUM helped quantify the impact on three of these four critical outcomes. In full risk arrangements (Owned, JV and Alliance) HUM saw 20% higher underwriting profit, 33% higher quality (stars) scores, 24% higher Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and -21% reduction in avoidable hospital admissions per thousands (APT) which each drive higher member retention. Essentially, by capitating away premiums an MCO such as HUM maximizes financial outcomes while almost entirely offloading risk. Therefore, MCOs are aggressively seeking to partner with providers who are able to accept full capitation arrangements, driving higher penetration in the sector.

**Working with more capitated physicians gives cost advantage, drives growth**
To make a finer point, MCOs generally will set the capitated rate such that they split the savings between the MCO and the provider. The MCO, in turn, would use those savings to cut pricing on its product to drive membership. Given minimum MLR restrictions, MCO margins are capped, so the most reliable way to grow earnings is through membership growth.

**Capitation reduces MCO’s utilization risk, improves ability to price**
Capitated arrangements shift risk from the MCO to the provider, so regardless of whether costs rise or fall unexpectedly, MCOs earnings are stable. Managed care companies price their MA contracts in May/June for the following year (commercial contracts are priced in the August/September timeframe), based upon expected utilization. In a fee for service world, if utilization rises after the product has been priced, MCOs will be less profitable. Under capitated arrangements MCOs have locked in a profit margin and the provider now bears utilization risk. Conversely, there would be less upside for MCOs if utilization comes in lower than expected, but this is a trade-off that MCOs are usually willing to make in return for earnings visibility. We highlight that this should theoretically be a short-term dynamic since the capitated contracts should be “marked-to-market” when they come up for renewal the following year, but managed care companies are happy to pay doctors more if costs rise unexpectedly, because they have to pay doctors a fair price for their services and MCOs are usually able to raise rates to their customers at the same time and pass that cost through.

**Aligned on pricing, want doctors to make as much as possible**
Meanwhile, our conversations with payers indicated that they do not want doctors to be losing money on capitated contracts, because doing so is likely to end in the physicians leaving the payer’s network and creating disruption for members. In fact, payers generally seemed more worried about doctors making too little than too much, as no payers indicated that high provider margins would be a reason to cut rates as long as they were delivering on the quality and cost targets outlined in the contract. In fact, some indicated that with minimum Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirements (which require that a plan has to spend 80% of its premiums on medical costs for individual and small group products and 85% for large group products and Medicare Advantage), they would prefer to bonus the money back to the doctor rather than pay a rebate to the customer to strengthen their network and incentivize physicians to control utilization.

**Help acquire new beneficiaries, convert into Medicare Advantage**
Another aligned incentive between capitated physicians and insurers is that the physician group is naturally going to prefer working with MA companies where it can capitate the patients over traditional Medicare where it has low margin fee for service arrangements. In many cases, capitated physician groups actually have insurance brokers on premise, ready to convert patients from Medicare FFS to a Medicare Advantage plan. Although there are rules that preclude doctors from steering a patient to a specific managed care plan, most patients of a doctor would look to use a plan where the doctor is in network, thus increasing the potential pool of capitated patients for the doctor and membership for the MCO.

**Patients get better service & benefits, high retention**
While much of the focus from investors on the value proposition of capitated providers groups is related to financial innovation for the benefit of MCOs, there is generally added value for patients as well. Beyond filling the health plan requirement to select a PCP, better management of chronic conditions not only saves money but improves the quality of life of the patient. Meanwhile, a portion of the savings the PCP helps generate get put back into additional benefits (such as lower copays/deductibles, free gym memberships or a free Part D plan).

For example, CenterWell (HUM’s capitated physician business) is able to move a patient into capitation, it immediately begins offering a wide range of services at no cost to the patient. For example, within the clinic CenterWell offers a one stop shop for patients to receive core medical service such as primary care alongside things like social services, advanced care planning, home care, in clinic lab tests and 24/7 virtual access.

**Capitation gives patient holistic rather than episodic care…**
The other main benefit a patient gets from being a member of capitated physician groups is having a doctor and care team who are incentivized to help the patient navigate the system. Healthcare can be an incredibly fragmented experience particularly for seniors who have to navigate multiple chronic conditions. Under FFS, or unmanaged health insurance plans, it can become onerous for the patient to find doctors they trust, and many times doctors give conflicting advice or prescribe medications that could have an adverse interaction with other drugs the patient is taking. Under the capitated model, each patient spends more time with the primary care doctor or care team and is being managed proactively and holistically rather than on an episodic basis.

**…Critics argue it creates the incentive to decrease care**
The goal of capitation is that it incentivizes doctors to reduce the cost of care as opposed to maximizing volumes under fee for service. Critics argue that this prioritizes financial profit over what is best for the patient. This dynamic is actually true to some extent (particularly in the short term), but for a doctor managing a patient with a heart condition, saving some money now by not prescribing heart medication, will cost much more down the road when that patient shows up in the hospital. Therefore, the incentive is to provide more of the right type of care and less of the low-value-added care. Meanwhile, since payments to MA plans (and therefore capitated doctors) are higher for high quality, there are financial incentives not to forgo care.

**>80 NPS scores versus 17 industry average imply patients are satisfied**
The data we have seen shows that NPS scores are higher than average for capitated physicians than for the physician industry broadly. In general, these companies claim that patients are reporting >80 NPS scores on the experiences in value-based clinics versus the primary care average of 17. If providers were truly suppressing utilization, it would be hard to sustain high NPS scores as patients would simply seek care elsewhere.

**Value-based care penetration varies by MCO**
Another interesting way of looking at our capitation payment data is to look at each of the public MCO’s (as well as Kaiser) penetration in capitation arrangements. Of the largest MCOs HUM, Kaiser, CI and UNH have the highest penetration in capitation.

**Of large MCOs HUM, Kaiser, UNH, CI have highest penetration in capitation**
We analyzed statutory filings of MCOs to determine how much of their risk-based insurance is capitated to providers. Notably, HUM has the highest concentration of business in Medicare Advantage (where capitation is most common) and has been pushing value-based care for more than a decade. UNH has also been pushing value-based care and actually owns the largest physician group in the country, but has a broader insurance business beyond Medicare Advantage. Kaiser is unique in that it also owns a physician business and capitates much of its insurance business to its own providers. The most surprising MCO to show up with high ranking is CI, but CI has talked about using ‘high performing’ (value-based networks) as a core strategy in key geographies, meaning that the little MA business it does have is highly penetrated.

Additionally, we note that for the major national insurers (CI, CVS, ELV, UNH) the actual percentage of business in capitation is much lower than initially screens due to the sizable ASO (self-insured) business not getting captured in this data. However, this data is still instructive because risk premiums are likely the first place MCOs would look to capitate to providers as it would not require as much buy-in from employer customers.

| ALHC | 38% | 62% |
| BHG | 80% | 20% |
| CLOV | 2% | 98% |
| CI | 70% | 30% |

| Industry | 82% | 18% |

**Meanwhile, ELV, CNC, CVS, MOH are lagging much further behind**
Meanwhile, ELV, CNC, CVS and MOH are all much further behind in terms of capitating spending. We also note that these four companies generally have a smaller MA footprint as a percentage of total risk premiums than the companies noted above (except CI). All four of these MCOs have historically taken the view that owning capital intensive physician assets such as physician groups was not a part of the core strategy. CVS and to a lesser extent ELV have now begun shifting their businesses towards these types of assets and into greater risk sharing arraignments, but are still in early innings.

| MOH | 76% | 13% | 11% |
| OSCR | 94% | 6% | 0% |
| UNH | 47% | 28% | 25% |

**Of disruptive MCOs, ALHC/BHG furthest on risk spectrum versus OSCR/CLOV**
Finally of the smaller more disruptive (tech enabled, recent IPOs) MCOs, ALHC has the highest penetration in capitation arrangements due to its focus on Medicare Advantage and value-based care as a core strategy and geographic concentration in California (a market that has high capitation). ALHC is followed by BHG which has started building out its own capitated physician business. Finally, OSCR and CLOV have the least penetration in value based care as they had taken philosophically different approaches to managing costs.

**However, bonuses (quality) have increased penetration**
Meanwhile, the proportion of payments categorized as bonuses have been increasing meaningfully in recent years, jumping from 5% in 2016 to 11% in 2021. We note that the amount of payments tied to bonuses is likely materially higher as the bonus typically only represents 5-20% of the actual amount insurers are paying to a provider. This acceleration in bonus linked payments highlights the increasing demand from insurers to move away from fee-for-service. These increases in bonus payments could be viewed as a leading indicator towards near term growth in capitation arrangements as providers interested in practicing value-based care generally dip their toes in the water by testing simpler arrangements such as these.

**Capitation and bonus payments growing faster than FFS**
On a three-year rolling average basis (to smooth out large year to year contract fluctuations) capitation arrangements have been growing in the low to mid-teens range, meanwhile bonus payments have grown low to high teens, and fee for service has grown in the single digits. Finally, the delta between FFS and other arrangements has been more pronounced in the past five years.

**CA and other states already far along in capitation models**
Despite relatively low penetration in the national data today, capitation did not disappear entirely in the 90’s and remained a common form of payment in many markets. In particular, CA is largely viewed as the most advanced state at taking capitation, which the data here supports (implying 31% of all payments). Meanwhile, FL and the southwestern region are also well-known capitation markets, as well as markets which have gravitated towards narrower HMO networks.

**However, most of the country still lags in adoption**
Overall, the capitation model has proved successful in some markets, which have held their penetration rates relatively steady for much of the past decade or two, but only 13 states and territories have more >5% penetration today and most states in the US still have close to 0%, leaving plenty of white space for new entrants to expand. However, payments have lagged for a reason, and shifting existing physician behavior is more difficult than operating in states with momentum where most providers are familiar with the model of reimbursement.

**Patient recruitment, attribution, retention**
We’ve spent a lot of time discussing the underlying growth of the target market for capitated physician companies, but it’s worth taking a moment to discuss how these groups find and onboard customers.

**Similar to retail, patient recruitment relies on marketing**
We don’t generally think about doctor practices the same way we think about retail stores, but both need to drive customers into the office or store to provide a service. In order to drive volumes, provider groups engage in similar types of outreach. Marketing efforts include traditional advertising such as TV, radio, newspapers, mobile etc. Additionally, some practices will enter a cobranded relationship with a reputable brand such as AARP in the case of OSH. Finally, many physician groups which are looking to fill clinics with seniors and other targeted populations will host in person community events (in churches or community outreach centers), which can be tailored to specific cultures such as a Cinco de Mayo event in markets with a high Hispanic population.

**Additionally, physicians need buy-in from insurers**
For most physician practices in fee-for-service,the goal is to work with various large insurance companies in your geography and negotiate an in-network rate for each service provided. However, in the case of capitation the contract terms are more sophisticated and takes more time to negotiate. The general premise however is similar, the physician group enters the network of the insurer and the insurer agrees to reimburse for each patient engaged in the model. Generally, in the case of full-risk arrangements the insurer will agree to pay the provider group around 85% of premiums (higher percentage is better for the provider, worse for the insurer), leaving the provider at risk for the costs of the patient.

**Regional insurers may not have sophistication to capitate risk**
Despite the fact that for the most part, transferring risk to a provider group is in the best interest of the insurance company, it may not always be a given. The actual mechanics of transferring risk from the insurance company to the provider group are relatively complicated and a regional insurance company may not have the will, technology, or sophistication to get involved. For example, which costs count to the physician versus the health plan? How do you calculate copays/deductibles to the patient in a capitated arrangement?

**National insurers generally want to work with physicians**
The consolidation within the managed care industry is usually seen as a negative by providers, but in the case of shifting business to capitation, it likely is a positive. In MA the largest 4 payers represent ~61% of individual enrollment (HUM/UNH alone being 46%). All four of these insurers are sophisticated in value-based care and generally willing and able to capitate to any physician group able to manage risk effectively while maintaining quality. In many cases, provider groups may even be able to obtain national contracts, allowing them to expand into new geographies knowing that at least a high proportion of insurers will support the model.

| ELV         | 7%               |
| Other       | 39%              |

**Patient attribution varies by program, plan design**
In a practical sense, getting a specific patient assigned to a specific provider group may be more complicated than it seems. In the real world, patients have no idea how their doctor is paid by the MCO (capitated or FFS) and could choose to see a number of different doctors in a year. Given that these contracts can represent a material amount of revenue (and risk), it is important to have specific mechanism in place so that everyone understands who is responsible for a patient’s costs.

**HMO plans (2/3 of enrollment) require patients to designate primary care doctor**
Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are structured in a way where the network is very narrow, and a patient is required to select a specific provider as their ‘gatekeeper’ in order to receive referrals to specialists and other downstream healthcare providers. In that case it is very clear to the insurer where to assign the risk, because the patients specifically selects a primary care provider. As a result, capitated arrangements tend to be more focused on HMO products. HMO plans represent roughly 2/3 of Individual MA enrollment, creating a relatively straightforward attribution method for the majority or MA membership.

**PPO plans may rely on claims data or verbal commitment from patients**
Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) on the other hand, have larger and wider networks where patients do not have to explicitly select a primary care provider. In that case, insurers can analyze their own claims data and see where a patient has been getting treated the most and assign risk to that provider. In some cases,though, an insurer will require verbal confirmation from a patient by calling them. This can create some potential issues for a provider who hasn’t seen a patient in a year and doesn’t know if they are still the PCP at risk, or if the patient has moved to another provider. There have been instances where capitated companies will adjust their membership from quarter to quarter based on the most recent attribution data from the MCO.

**Government programs use similar mechanisms**
As discussed earlier, there are government programs whereby providers contract directly with the Medicare to take capitated risk. In those cases, the government generally follows similar principles in assigning beneficiaries. Essentially, Medicare also either relies on claims data (assigning beneficiaries to the provider they used most in the past year of data) or will require patients to fill out a voluntary alignment form. We note however that some companies have complained that the assignment process can take longer than expected in government programs versus private insurance markets, and sometimes a patient may even be enrolled in a separate government program through claims alignment which preempts the patients from being assigned to a provider which is actually treating the patient in the near term (as government claims alignment can happen on yearslong lag).

**Patient churn can be significant, likely 15-20% range**
One dynamic worth considering is that patient churn can be significant. About half of patient churn is driven by attrition, or switching provider groups (because a patient prefers another provider, or they switch health plans and the current provider is not in network with the new plan), or moving to another city or state. The other half of patient churn is driven by patient mortality, as currently the model focuses on the sickest patients, so mortality is expected to be above average.

In general, companies have not quantified expected patient churn. However, as a reference point, dialysis companies like DVA see 20-25% churn from patients dying each year. Given dialysis patients are one of the sickest cohort of patients, the 20-25% likely would be an upper bound of actual patient churn for a capitated physician group servicing a broader population. As an additional datapoint OSH mentioned their churn was ‘well below 30%’ on a public earnings call in response to an investor question, while HUM has highlighted churn at CenterWell is ‘surprisingly’ higher than the core insurance business. Taken together, a reasonable estimate could be 15-20% annual patient churn for a capitated provider. As a result, a provider would need to bring in a significant amount of new patients to remain flat, much less grow.

## Pricing and reimbursement

**Coverage is widely fragmented by payer**
There are three main buckets of healthcare coverage in the US (commercial, Medicare and Medicaid), but within those, there are dozens of different plan and network designs (eg AET Commercial PPO, versus UNH Medicare Advantage HMO versus Medicaid FFS, etc).

From the perspective of the provider, this means that the weighted average patient panel would be 57% commercial, 24% Medicaid and 19% Medicare, and each of those major buckets could have potentially dozens of different payers and each of those payers could have multiple plan designs.

**The rise of Managed Care in government programs**
One pocket of enrollment which has seen a dramatic shift in the past decade has been from traditionally run government sponsored insurance (such as Medicare and Medicaid) to Managed Care run programs (Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid). Due to the Affordable Care Act (Medicaid) and an aging population (Medicare), the programs themselves have expanded in size. However, the programs have also increasingly become outsourced to the private industry. From 2010 to 2021, Medicaid and Medicaid together shifted from 38% private insurance coverage to 63%.

This has implications for providers because Managed Care companies often create narrow networked HMO plans which only include a smaller subset of provider groups. Therefore, to drive volumes from government programs (which are becoming larger in scope) the providers must work closely with insurance companies, potentially sacrificing on rates, and agreeing to manage to specific quality or value-based metrics.

**Variety makes it more difficult to change behavior**
By having such a fragmented mix of payers across the average provider patient panel it makes it more difficult to shift provider behavior. For example, two different Medicare Advantage plans may have two different protocols for medically managing a certain type of patient or have different quality metrics that they judge providers on, while commercial may have no risk scoring or quality metrics at all. Asking providers to shift how they engage and interact with their patient based upon that patient’s coverage (rather than that patient’s medical needs), can make it difficult for providers to standardize care and uniformly provide good outcomes.

**Fragmentation makes it harder to have a sizable risk pool**
A typical small primary care practice may employ just a handful of doctors and therefore only treat a few thousand patients annually. However, because of the fact that coverage is split widely across payer types and plans a small provider group may only have a few hundred members in any particular plan such as a HUM Medicare Advantage plan or CNC Managed Medicaid plan.

If the provider is interested in moving to value-based care and taking financial risk it may be difficult to create an adequate risk pool with one health plan, which can require thousands of patients per contract to adequately spread risk. Otherwise, the primary care doctor may be exposed to outsized downside if one or two patients develop high cost diseases such as cancer or ESRD. Therefore, in order to take risk, a small provider group may need to seek an external ‘enablement’ partner to aggregate risk into larger pools and spread costs across a larger population.

**Three major types of insurance coverage**
In the section below we provide a brief overview on the major forms of insurance. At a high level, the insurance market is fragmented into three buckets: 1) Medicare, the federally run government program for the elderly. 2) Medicaid, the state-run government program for the low income population. 3) Commercial, the non-government private insurance market. Within each bucket the are many subgroups of insurance types, many of which we touch on as well.

**Medicare – Government insurance for the elderly**
Medicare is the federal reimbursement system that pays for healthcare services for the elderly which covers about 67 million people. Those that qualify for Medicare are: 1) people 65 and older; 2) people under 65 with certain disabilities; and 3) people of any age with end-stage renal disease. There are four main components of Medicare:

**Part A – Hospital Insurance** is often referred to as Hospital Insurance (HI) and is the base benefit provided under Medicare. It covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing, home health and hospice services.

**Part B – Supplementary Medical Insurance** is often called Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) and is optional for beneficiaries. Part B covers hospital outpatient services, physician services, home health and durable medical equipment as well as certain physician administered drugs.

**Part C – Medicare Advantage** is the privatized version of Medicare where CMS pays a certain amount per member per month to an MCO who then offers a managed care plan to seniors. Plans are required to cover the services in Parts A and B but can also include additional benefits such as a free Part D plan, lower coinsurance/copays or things like dental vision and hearing. The MCO is responsible for paying for all medical care that the individual receives during the month.

**Part D – Outpatient prescription drugs for seniors** is structured in a similar way to Part C, where the government will make a payment per member per month to an MCO, who will then structure a prescription drug plan to market to seniors. These plans compete against each other based upon the types of drugs that are covered as well as the premiums and copays that are charged. Notably, outpatient drugs are not covered by Original Medicare, so seniors’ only option to avoid paying out of pocket is to seek private coverage such as Part D plans.

**Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) Medicare Parts A and B** (often called Original Medicare or Medicare FFS) covers about 80% of the cost of covered services, but seniors can incur significant out of pocket expense on the remaining 20% as well as costs related to non-covered services. As a result, the majority of seniors who choose Medicare FFS also have some form of supplemental coverage. Medicare Supplement Insurance (also called Medigap) is sold by managed care and general insurance companies. Medigap policies help pay for out-of-pocket expenses (coinsurance, copayments, or deductibles) and some plans also cover benefits that Medicare FFS does not cover. Medigap premiums are significantly higher than MA, but the key advantage of Medigap is that Medigap does not require a network, which could appeal to people who expect to use the system heavily and/or can afford to spend more on premiums.

**Seniors do not need to enroll in every part of Medicare**
There are a number of options and coverage combinations that a senior can choose from which have implications for total premiums, out of pocket costs and benefits. For example, a senior can choose to stay on Part A + Part B alone, or add a Part D plan for drugs, as well as Medicare Supplemental to prevent high out of pocket costs. Alternatively, the senior could exclusively seek a Part C (Medicare Advantage) plan, which can include Part D.

**Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) & ACO REACH** are not coverage options in the traditional sense as, from the patient’s perspective, they wouldn’t really see the difference versus being enrolled in Original Medicare. However, these programs allow capitated providers to enter into risk taking arrangements on Original Medicare beneficiaries (without an insurance company intermediary). These programs operate with similar conceptual frameworks to Medicare Advantage, such that the government pays providers (instead of insurers) a benchmark rate to treat beneficiaries and that profits are generated by generating savings versus that benchmark. Aside from focusing on providers instead of insurers, the key difference is that those programs do not generally offer beneficiaries many extra benefits, nor do they restrict network sizes. A large portion of the savings conceptually are retained by the federal government over time, while the rest is retained as profit by the providers.

**Medicaid – state-run insurance for the poor**
Medicaid is the state-run healthcare program for the low-income population, covering roughly 83 million people (including the Children’s Health Insurance Plan or CHIP). The federal government contributes about 2/3 of Medicaid funding and sets broad criteria for states to follow, but the program is run by the states, resulting in 50 different Medicaid programs. States used to run their own FFS programs, but are increasingly outsourcing them to private insurers, who now represent >3/4 of Medicaid members and >1/2 of Medicaid spending. In these cases, states pay private insurers a premium per member per month to furnish the benefit on their behalf, in a program known as Managed Medicaid. The MCO is responsible for paying for all medical care that the individual receives during the month.

**Wide range of eligibility, demographics**
There are federal minimum levels of eligibility for Medicaid, but states have the discretion to cover broader populations. Eligibility depends on the person’s category (eg, child or senior), age, and income and resources (including bank accounts, real estate, and other liquid assets). In addition to meeting certain low-income thresholds, in order to be covered by Medicaid, you must also fall into one of the four coverage categories. There are three mandatory categories for coverage: 1) children/ pregnant women (aka TANF or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), 2) the aged, blind, or disabled (ABD), and 3) people receiving long-term support services (LTSS). The ACA created a fourth category when it expanded the program to everyone under 138% of the federal poverty level, but states have to opt-in to expansion.

*   **Children ages 6-18:** Up to 100% of Federal Poverty Level
*   **Parent with Medicaid child:** Up to 14% of Federal Poverty Level

*   **Long term care (require nursing home or home healthcare):** Up to 74% of Federal Poverty Level
*   **Childless adults:** Not currently required to be covered.

**MCOs have had more success outsourcing low acuity versus high acuity lives**
In general, Managed care has high penetration of the Temporary Assistance for Need Family (TANF) program and the Medicaid expansion population which tend to be the lower acuity portion of the population (though it is the vast majority of membership) . However, there is lower penetration of the disabled and elderly eligibility classes which are higher acuity and tend to have higher rates.

|---|---|---|
| Children | 78% | 88% |
| Expansion Adult | 77% | 89% |
| Aged & Disabled | 73% | 69% |
| All Other Adults | 78% | 83% |

**Dual eligible – members in both Medicare/Medicaid**
Dual eligible beneficiaries are low-income seniors enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid. There are over 12 million duals in the US – these beneficiaries receive the same Medicare Part A/B benefits as non-dual seniors, but also receive extra financial assistance as Medicaid picks up the tab for monthly premiums, out of pocket expenses as well as benefits that are not covered in Medicare, such as long-term care. We note that total dual eligibles are growing slightly faster than the overall Medicare population, but MCO penetration is slightly lower than overall MA and therefore MA dual growth is growing faster than MA overall.

**Duals represent disproportionate portion of spend, highly acute**
Duals represent 20% of Medicare enrollment but 34% of spending and represent 15% of Medicaid enrollment but 32% of Medicaid spending. Meanwhile, most duals qualify for Medicare due to disability, highlighting the high acuity nature of these patients.

| ESRD               | 1%         |
| Disability & ESRD  | 1%         |

**Commercial – Private insurance, mostly employment based**
The final and largest bucket of major insurance coverage in the US (covering about 193 million people) is the commercial market. Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, the government does not directly pay for beneficiary coverage, or set prices for providers. Instead, insurers create their own networks of providers, cost sharing, benefit designs and determine a fair price (monthly premiums) based on their own forecasts of expected costs. Competition from other insurers helps regulate down premiums towards an amount that more closely reflects expected costs.

**Employer commercial risk – generally smaller employers**
The most straightforward example of what most people think when they hear about health insurance is employer based commercial risk coverage, which covers about 54 million people in the US. Under employer-sponsored commercial risk insurance, the MCO directly negotiates a price with the employer for a monthly premium to cover its employees (typically runs at approximately $550 per month). The employer has historically contributed about 70%-75% of the premium and the employee contributes the rest plus out of pocket expenses (co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles). The product is called “risk” because the insurer is at risk of loss if costs exceed the premiums collected.

**Individual commercial risk – generally low income or self employed**
People without employer sponsored insurance that do not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid (ie, self-employed or employer does not provide insurance) can purchase insurance coverage through the individual market for themselves and their families. This type of coverage is often referred to as IFP or “Individual and Family Plans” and covers roughly 16 million people through what is known as the “Exchanges” or “Marketplace” regulated by the Affordable Care Act or ACA. Unlike employer coverage, the exchanges are more regulated with a standardized benefit package that insurers must offer. Additionally, the government provides substantial subsidies for people with income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level to purchase insurance on the exchanges (with premiums capped at 8.5% of income above 400%). The subsidies are based on a sliding scale that caps premiums as a percentage of income depending on income levels. The federal government is responsible for the amount of the premium above the income cap.

**Employer based commercial “ASO” – generally larger employers**
The largest single form of health coverage in the US is employer-based commercial “ASO” which stands for Administrative Services Only and covers about 124 million people. For the commercial ASO product, the MCO collects a fee from the employer (approximately $30 per member per month) and is responsible for administering health insurance for the employer’s employees and dependents. The MCO does not take on underwriting risk with ASO products as the employer is responsible for medical costs net of out-of-pocket costs required to be paid the by employee.

**MCOs help the employer operate as an insurer**
Similar to the risk business, the MCO negotiates the unit costs for the medical care with providers (eg, hospitals, labs, physicians, drug costs). However, these costs are essentially a pass through from the MCO to the customer and, as such, the MCO does not book either revenue or costs associated with these medical expenses, as it does not impact their economics.

**Large employers sophisticated enough to take risk**
The customers in the ASO business are typically large employers that have large enough employee populations across which to spread the underwriting risk and are willing to accept the potential volatility in claims on a year-to-year basis in return for keeping the risk premium that is imbedded in the price of a risk contract (i.e. it is significantly cheaper than a full risk product). Despite bearing the risk themselves, these large employers still need managed care companies to administer claims, create a benefit design and contract with providers.

**Economics to the provider are the same in risk or ASO**
Although the funding mechanism to the employer varies between risk and ASO, to the provider, overall rates from the MCOs are largely the same between a risk and ASO contract. As a result, from the provider perspective, we tend to view commercial as one market.

## Pricing and reimbursement
Physician reimbursement is dramatically different from FFS and looks more like insurance accounting than traditional provider accounting. As a result, it is important to understand the various incentives and mechanisms by which health insurance operates, in order to understand how it flows through to the provider. In the sections below we walk through the key concepts with a particular focus on Medicare Advantage (MA) as it is the type of insurance with the highest penetration of value-based care. Meanwhile we review insurance pricing and reimbursement implications for value-based care and at the end we compare other forms of coverage and why they haven’t yet seen similar penetration yet.

In this section we will break down the individual components which determine how provider capitation revenue is determined which we outline at a high level in the formula below.

((Program benchmark/premiums + Risk Adjustment + Quality Bonus) – Benefit Design) * Capitation Rate = Net Capitation Revenue.

**Benchmark.** is initially set by program level factors. For example, in Medicare Advantage, the starting point of reimbursement for an insurer is based on the average spending for a patient in Original Medicare in that county. However, in the commercial market premiums are set directly by the insurer based on their estimate of costs.

**Risk Adjustment.** From there, the benchmark is adjusted up or down at the individual level based on that patient’s health status (since it costs more to treat sicker patients and less to treat healthier patients).

**Quality Bonuses.** The benchmark is again adjusted based on quality metrics (the higher the quality the more the insurer gets paid).

**Capitation Rate.** That reimbursement level is then capitated to a provider (generally at the minimum MLR or 85%) which is what providers book as revenue.

**Benefit Design.** Finally, the benefit design of the insurer will ultimately impact the dollars that a provider has to manage. In MA, MCOs can bid below the benchmark and use those savings to provider extra services not covered by traditional Medicare. For example, if an insurer offers supplemental benefits like a gym membership, the capitated provider will have to pay out those claims, without any real opportunity to manage down those costs. Therefore, the capitation rate net of supplemental benefits is the more relevant indication of reimbursement, since it represents the dollars a provider can actually earn a margin on. MCOs always have to balance their margins versus their growth objectives when they set the benefit design (all else equal an MCO can earn a higher margin with fewer benefits but growth will be slower, and vice versa). Since the capitated provider gets paid a percentage of the MCO revenue and has to cover the MCO’s benefit design, the higher the margin the MCO is bidding to, the easier it is for the capitated physician to make a margin too.

## Benchmarks and premium setting
To many consumers the price of a health insurance plan may feel arbitrarily high at times, but unsurprisingly the guiding core philosophy of rate setting is essentially to match expected costs with premiums (plus a small % cushion for margins).

In the commercial market, insurers and beneficiaries/plan sponsors (employers) negotiate premiums based on their own expected costs which are paid for by beneficiaries. However, in a government program like Medicare Advantage the government sets and pays the premiums to insurers on behalf of beneficiaries. Below we walk through the multi-step process by which MCOs get paid to offer MA plans.

**Plan payments hinge on FFS Benchmark, the government’s own costs**
The guiding principle for Medicare Advantage plan reimbursement is that plans should be paid what it costs for the federal government to offer Original Medicare coverage to the beneficiary. The way this is implemented is that CMS creates a local benchmark (similar to an index) at the county level of costs based on actual expenditures from the average Original Medicare beneficiaries. Using this historical data, CMS then forecasts its own cost growth to determine the starting point for Medicare Advantage plan reimbursement, built up from the average beneficiary level.

**If MA plans keep costs below benchmark, they can offer extra benefits**
Since MA in theory costs the same as it does to operate Original Medicare and seniors have the option to join either one, MA providers have to provide seniors a compelling reason to choose their plan. The program is structured such that MA plans are incentivized to save money versus the benchmark then use those savings to fund additional benefits it can offer to seniors that are not covered in traditional Medicare. Plans bid below the benchmark level spending in a country and receive most of the delta between their bid and the benchmark in what are called rebate dollars (plan bids must cover Part A and Part B covered services as well as the MCO’s G&A and target profit margin). The plan uses these dollars to fund extra benefits, and if it wants to provide more benefits than it can fund with rebates, it would have to charge a premium to the individual to cover the delta. As a result, the better the MCO is at controlling costs, the more benefits it can provide, helping it drive more membership growth.

Given the way that the program is structured, the savings MA plans generate aren’t retained by the government, and instead go to the senior in the form of additional benefits (such as dental/vision/hearing).

**Conversely, MA plans can cut benefits in response to rate cuts**
Unlike other insurance sectors where cuts to reimbursement automatically lead to margin compression, MCOs and Medicare Advantage plans have the ability to maintain margins despite rate pressures by adjusting their benefits (raising copays/deductibles, cutting optional services like vision, dental, etc.). However, the elimination of the extra benefits could create a headwind to enrollment growth if seniors determine that the remaining extra benefits are not worth the tradeoff of accepting network restrictions typical of MA (Original Medicare has completely open networks).

**Benchmarks can vary widely by geography**
Its worth reiterating the point above that benchmarks are calculated at the local, county level as there are significant variations in costs across geographies due to cost of living, acuity of the population and consumer habits. Since the benchmark is the starting point for reimbursement, companies that can achieve the most cost savings relative to FFS can provide the most value to seniors through extra benefits. Geographies that have the highest FFS spending rates (such as Miami, Florida) are usually the best areas for Medicare Advantage companies to operate since there is the most ‘fat’ to cut.

**MA cost trend has averaged ~4%, additional adjustments to the benchmark**
Cost trend in the overall Medicare program has averaged about 3.7% since 2005. Notably there is a significant difference between forecasted cost trend and the rates MA plans end up getting as there are other adjustments to the benchmark which can have a material impact on reimbursement such as star ratings, coding adjustments, y/y changes to the risk model, and a normalization factor (see our note on the final 2023 rate notice for more detail here). Notably, rate increases don’t really impact margins for MCOs or capitated providers over the long term, because the MCOs generally add or subtract benefits to maintain the same percentage margin in any given year.

**Medicaid closer to 1-2% while commercial 5-6%**
Meanwhile in Medicaid, states (which have tighter budgets because they have to balance their budgets annual) often mandate something closer to 1-2% cost trend updates annually. As a result of Medicare/Medicaid mandating costs, providers and in particular hospitals require stronger rate updates from commercial plans which hover closer to 5-6%.

**Risk Adjustment**
Importantly (as mentioned in the introduction) to sustainably take risk, revenues must exceed costs over time. When insurance companies take risk on large portions of the population (such as the employer market), the aggregate spending averages to be a predictable amount due to the law of large numbers, as the sickest members are offset by relatively healthy members who all pay similar premiums. However, if an insurer takes risk on a specific beneficiary, simply getting paid the average premium may not justify the costs if that patient has a high-cost condition such as cancer or diabetes. To prevent insurers from avoiding sick patients, government programs like Medicare Advantage have a mechanism called ‘risk adjustment’ to pay insurers more to treat sicker patients (since they have higher medical claims).

**CMS pays more for patients with more medical conditions**
In Medicare Advantage, CMS pays health plans more than average to treat patients with chronic conditions/medical complications and will pay plans less than average for a patient that is relatively healthy, through what is known as a ‘risk adjustment’. This model aligns payments with expected costs and removes the incentive of MCOs to only target healthy patients.

The way this is functionally calculated at a high level is that the government looks at diagnoses codes submitted by doctors in the Original Medicare program and compares those codes against the actual costs incurred by patients in the following year. For example, the government looks at all patients with a submitted diabetes diagnoses codes and how their costs have trended versus the average beneficiary, and assigns the excess spending as the value of risk codes submitted in Medicare Advantage.

**Capitation gives providers incentive to risk code more**
Since most doctors don’t get paid more to treat a patient with flu who has a heart condition than one who doesn’t, there is no financial incentive to add additional administrative burden and spend additional time with a patient. However, since capitated providers get paid as a percentage of premiums, any risk coding benefit would be shared with the provider. Below we illustrate these dynamics, in a hypothetical example where a 7% increase in risk coding leads to a 21% increase in net income for an MCO despite paying out higher rates to the capitated provider (who receive 85% of any revenue increase), boosting the provider’s EBITDA margins by 70% without any incremental cost savings.

**MCOs are accused of ‘gaming the system’**
The risk adjustment payment is based on the data that MCOs collect on the patients, creating the incentive for MCOs to fully document and code their members in order to get paid more. MedPAC, an industry watchdog within the government, estimates that MA plans are overpaid by $12b annually (as of 2020) based on these incentives and lack of enforcement actions.

Based on MedPAC’s findings, MA plans are getting 8.9% higher payments versus FFS due to risk adjustment however CMS already accounts for this through a 5.9% coding intensity adjustment (the minimum required by law) meaning that CMS already attempts to normalize for these factors to some extent. MedPAC argues that the adjustment should be 3.0% higher. However, this approach is somewhat flawed because it adjusts rates at an industry level and therefore plans who are under coding get punished and those over coding continue to have a relative advantage and are actually incentivized to code more to overcome the adjustment.

**Auditing MA plans seen as one solution**
One of the actions the government is taking to solve the incentive problem is auditing MA plan codes more rigorously. RADV (Risk Adjustment Data Validation) is what CMS describes as the ‘primary corrective action taken to reduce improper payment rates in the Medicare Advantage program’. Since there is an incentive for MA organizations to potentially over-report diagnoses so that they can increase their payment, CMS audits plan-submitted diagnosis data a few years later to ensure they are supported by medical record documentation.

During a RADV audit CMS annually selects ~30 MA contracts to review / ensure that plans have medical documentation to support the risk codes they submitted, including a review of hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician/practitioner provider medical records.

The advantage of a RADV audit versus an industry wide normalization factor is that the RADV audit will punish specific plans which are over coding and actually does shift incentives away from over coding. However, it is limited in scope (30 plans a year) and audits happen on a lag (2014 audits have not been released yet). See our note on RADV here.

**Meanwhile DOJ/OIG conducting investigations into most large insurers**
Meanwhile, There have been a number of DOJ lawsuits against large MA players such as CI, ELV, and UNH (see reports) which allege that companies are over coding and gaming the system to squeeze more reimbursement from the government.

Additionally, the OIG (Office of Inspector General) engages in separate RADV and MA audits which has led to recommendations of >$300m in recoupments from the industry (including a number of large non-profits), of which CMS is now requiring MA plans to remit amounts based upon OIG audits.

None of these lawsuits or inquiries have resulted in serious enforcement actions yet, but there has been some anxiety in the industry around the potential for increased scrutiny around risk adjustment in the coming years, especially under a relatively new Democratic administration.

**Accusations of physician ‘coding shops’ aren’t so simple**
Given that capitated providers have a direct financial incentive to risk code while most other providers do not, many industry watchers have accused capitated providers of being ‘coding shops’ and argue they are helping MCOs game the system and would not be able to sustain the same margins without aggressive coding practices.

In general, there are three different types of behavior which can lead to greater than average risk coding 1) Submitting risk codes fraudulently, 2) Submitting risk codes without all of the required documentation, 3) Fully risk coding every condition. 4) Targeting the sickest patients.

**1) Fraudulent coding at scale is unlikely, would get caught in audits**
Fraudulently submitting risk codes, which is the first thing investors think of when they hear about over coding practices, is likely the smallest contributor towards over coding in our view. Companies like AGL/OSH/CANO and especially UNH/HUM are subject to a high degree of scrutiny through public company reporting standards and are being regularly audited. Not only are physicians and MA plans being audited, but since MA plans become at risk based on physician coding, MA plans are also doing some amount of supervision of the codes that the doctors send them. Although it is a risk that cannot be 100% disregarded, overt fraud of scaled players would likely be found at some point and leaves the management team potentially liable for criminal charges.

**2) Submitting codes without full documentation a potential big contributor**
As mentioned above, CMS has started auditing Medicare Advantage plan risk adjustment practices to find examples of submitted codes without full documentation. Based on CMS’s findings and DoJ public court cases it appears that to some degree, plans are operating in a gray area. For example, the government has found instances of plans submitting condition codes for diabetes without having a supporting lab confirmed test result, instead relying on the patient to disclose the information, or using some less reliable indicator like a nurse diagnosis. If these types of practices are widespread, we believe they are due to the fact that the government has not been enforcing more stringent requirements for the past decade (government has been slow to react).

**MA plans could target recoupment based on errors of other providers**
The government has now released regulations (RADV) targeted at recouping these unsupported risk codes as of early 2023. However, the extrapolated recoupments will only begin in 2025 starting with payment year 2018, before companies like AGL/OSH/CANO really operated at scale and are therefore unlikely to be impacted in the near term. Over time though,these capitated providers could be targeted by MA plans for part of the recoupments related to risk coding if those providers failed to document patients appropriately.

To the extent that an MA plan has to pay money back to the government, it is unclear how that might flow through to the physician practice. The CMS sample size for a given contract is just 201 enrollees and any provider would be a small fraction of that potentially making extrapolating from that sample difficult. Meanwhile, applying the error rate used by CMS means hitting a capitated physician based on errors from other providers, which could lead to conflict. Additionally, these capitated providers are generally more sophisticated than average and given the importance of risk scoring to their model, are likely much more compliant in providing supporting documentation. Arguably, in an environment where plans are audited more consistently and the penalty for lack of documentation grows, the value of the capitated model will only increase as those doctors have technology platforms built for compliant risk adjustment.

**3) Full coding likely the largest contributor**
Another piece of why MA plans/capitated providers code more than the original Medicare program is simply because there is an incentive to do so. Even if there is no wrongdoing, fraud or unsupported documentation, simply paying someone to complete a task is enough to lead to a behavior change. One of the more controversial examples of this, was that the DoJ found some plans were reviewing old patient record data to find instances where doctors could submit a code, but did not, and were not spending the same amount of effort to review patient records to find codes that are no longer applicable. While not technically illegal, it highlights the challenges the regulator faces in a system like this and creates some overhang for potential adjustments.

It is important to note that the government generally believes “the coding issue” is driven more by the incentives in the system rather than the fraud. Most fee-for-service providers groups have the incentive to rush through patient visits in order to maximize the number of billable events. However, in value-based care, providers have the same incentives as the insurers, which get rewarded for ensuring adequate reimbursement (through risk adjustment) and medical management, both of which require understanding and documenting every condition a patient has.

In fact, the government already accounts for this incentive dynamic in MA rates by providing an across-the-board ‘coding intensity’ adjustment of 5.9% (the minimum required by law). However, this ‘punishes’ all plans equally, regardless of coding performance, and therefore doesn’t change the incentive of any individual company to code as much as possible. We don’t view full coding as a bad practice, as most companies, particularly capitated providers such as AGL/OSH/CANO are likely following the letter of the law. However, there is a risk the government makes changes to the system which could have outsized impacts on providers who are better than average at coding.

**4) Targeting sick patients raises average risk scores**
The incentive structure of value-based care is inherently different from fee for service, such that providers would gravitate towards geographies with patients with higher medical spending (generally low-income population) in order to more easily drive savings (more gaps in care to close). In contrast, FFS providers gravitate towards higher income areas to maximize reimbursement (better payer mix since commercial is the best payer). As a result, capitated providers are likely to have above average (>1.0) risk scores. However, that fact alone does not mean that they are illegally inflating risk scores, rather the risk scores would reflect the acuity of the patients the groups are seeking to treat.

Again, the MA program already has a mechanism in place to address this dynamic called normalization, which annually readjusted the overall MA program weighted risk adjustment score back to 1.0, another program-wide, rather than provider specific mechanism.

**Risk coding criticisms largely contained to Medicare Advantage**
It’s worth noting there is no standardized risk adjustment system in the commercial employer market. Meanwhile, on the exchanges risk coding is a zero-sum game so the industry as a whole cannot increase reimbursement from coding (though plans can outcompete each other).

In Medicaid, states have significant flexibility to set county benchmarks and have the authority to adjust up or down rates based on acuity data available to them. Therefore if any state were to find examples of elevated risk coding, it would likely adjust down the revenue weightings. Additionally, since states are ultimately basing rates on an average target margin across plans, they could make an across-the-board adjustment to cut rates if it is found plans are over coding or over earning in any way.

Finally, in Original Medicare Programs like MSSP / ACO REACH, there are more mechanisms in place to limit over coding such as provider level risk score growth caps, program-wide risk score growth caps, and more aggressive normalization factors.

**Quality bonuses**
In addition to getting paid more to treat sicker patients, insurers and providers often get paid more to achieve certain quality metrics, through quality bonuses. Quality bonuses are an important guard rail in private health insurance and value-based care because paying a company on the basis of lowering costs creates an incentive to deny care. To offset this dynamic, most government programs have an element of reimbursement tied to achieving certain quality metrics.

**Star ratings have material reimbursement implications**
In Medicare Advantage, the quality program is called ‘stars’. Broadly, there are three major types of measures that Medicare tracks to award quality bonuses 1) Health outcomes tracked through HEDIS measure outputs such as medication adherence or number of annual flu vaccines, 2) Customer satisfaction as measured by a survey of beneficiaries (CAHPS) such as member ratings of the plan, and 3) Service levels on administrative functions such as number of complaints submitted, or time to settle appeals. By measuring these outcomes and only rewarding plans that achieve them, the government is able to create important guardrails that ensure quality isn’t compromised.

**Large incumbent plans such as UNH/HUM have become very savvy at raising their quality metrics, which leads to better reimbursement and more flexibility to improve the benefit design. Today, having high (4+ star) quality scores have become table stakes in offering a competitive plan design. Below we show the various milestones of star ratings.**

| 5 stars         | 5%                     | 70%     |

**The big prize: 5% bonus payment**
The biggest milestone to reach for stars scores is 4 stars, as these plans receive a 5% boost to the benchmark. To put this in context, 5% is the entire expected margin of an MA plan. Therefore plans with most members in 4+ star contracts can offer benefit designs that plans below 4 stars could not compete with without having a 0% margin or materially better G&A/medical management structure.

**Rebates (and extra benefits) are also impacted**
In addition to the quality bonus payments, the star reimbursement system also adjusts the rebates by your quality score. Without going into to much detail, at a high level MA plans submit a bid to the government based on their costs for providing Medicare Part A and Part B services. This bid amount also covers the MA plan’s G&A expense as well as their target profit margin. Plans get to keep a portion of the delta between their bids and the benchmark spending by Medicare in that county to use to offer additional benefits to seniors. If a plan wants to offer more benefits than the rebate would fund, then the MCO would have to charge a premium to the member to fund the difference.

Rebates for high quality plans (4.5 quality stars or more out of 5) get to keep 70% of the bid versus the benchmark (with the remaining 30% going back to the government as savings). Rebates for medium quality plans (3.5-4.0 stars) are 65% and rebates for low quality plans (3.0 stars or less) are 50%.

**Higher stars plans can spend more on benefits**
Tying these concepts together, below we show the effects of an MA plan moving from 3 stars to 4 stars and vice versa. In the first example, moving from 3 to 4 stars increases the $1,000 benchmark by 5% to $1,050. Additionally, if we assume the plan bids $900, the amount the plan receives in rebates (to spend on extra benefits beyond what’s covered in Part A + Part B) increases from 50% to 65% ($50 -> $98) or $48. Therefore, the reported revenue of the plan increases from $950 to $998 when accounting for both the 5% benchmark increase and higher rebate.

Since the plan is required to spend away the extra rebates ($48 here) on extra benefits, the actual $ profits are the same, but the plan is able to offer a more compelling product and gain membership at the expense of lower rated peers. Additionally, with a higher benchmark and rebate capture rate, the plan could raise its bid from $900 -> $902.25 to maintain its 4.5% margins while still offering the same level of benefits. In that event, a small net reimbursement increase is passed to the capitated providers.

**Capitated providers drive higher stars**
HUM (the 2nd largest MA plan) has disclosed that providers in value-based care have been able to increase stars ratings from 3.3 -> 4.5, with higher amounts of risk taking leading to better results. These outcomes are not surprising to us, as value based providers are getting paid on a basis of performance rather than volume, and therefore the providers incentives begin to align with the insurer (such as submitting risk codes, focusing on quality metrics etc).

**Providers often earn performance specific bonuses**
Star ratings in Medicare Advantage are earned at the contract level, meaning that it incorporates the performance of dozens if not hundreds of providers. To have a high performing contract, most of those providers need to be focused on improving quality. However, this dynamic removes individual accountability as no single provider group is responsible for the overall results. To help encourage greater focus on quality metrics, MCOs often include performance specific quality bonuses which are paid out to providers for their specific performance against certain quality measures (which large match the same metrics for MA stars).

**Networks and provider rates**
For investors new to healthcare services, one dynamic which isn’t immediately apparent is that prices in healthcare for the same service, delivered in the same hospital, by the same physician can vary wildly based on the type of insurance a patient has. For example, commercial pricing for hospitals is about 250% of the Medicare fee schedule on average. These price differences can have significant implications for the cost of beneficiary premiums, benchmarks in value-based care as well as implications in controlling costs.

In the commercial market, rates for each service are negotiated between insurers and providers meaning there is no cap or floor to where rates can go. However, on the government businesses such as Medicare (as well as Medicaid) the government sets the fixed rate which all providers must accept. Even though Managed Care companies operating in government programs (such as Medicare Advantage or Managed Medicaid) can negotiate rates outside of the government mandated rate schedule, the rates tend to hover around what the government is willing to pay given that the government pays the health plan a rate that assumes their fee schedule is the MCO’s unit cost.

**Provider FFS Rates**
Each year, CMS updates rates for providers through an annual rule making process. Generally the rates are grown by CMS’s ‘market basket’ (CPI-like) forecast and adjusted for other dynamics CMS sees as relevant. While CMS solicits feedback, it can finalize proposals as it sees fit. As a result, providers are often unsatisfied with rate updates from CMS but have no choice but to accept them.

**Provider rates influence behavior, Commercial pays the most, Medicaid least**
According to Kaiser, Commercial rates for primary care are 143% of the Medicare reimbursement, while Medicaid would be just 72%.

If the fixed/variable costs associated with a patient visit are the same for each type of patient (generally true) then the reimbursement itself can dramatically impact margins. In this hypothetical example presented below, the cost of the provider’s salary to furnish the visit are $67 (average salary is $250,000 and we estimate ~3,700 visits per year in a later section), therefore if Medicare reimburses the visit at $120, there is only $53 in contribution margin (44% margins, before clinic overhead such as rent and support staff salaries). However, if Commercial rates are 143% of Medicare, and the $67 visit salary cost is constant, the provider’s margin would be $104 or 61%. For Medicaid however, if rates were just 72% of Medicare, the contribution margin to the doctor could be as low as 22%.

**Providers don’t need a ‘solution’ for commercial, as much as government**
As a result of the disparity between commercial and government rates, providers aren’t as interested in value-based care solutions for the commercial business since it is already the most profitable part of its patient panel. However, the provider may be more open to value-based arrangements on Medicare/Medicaid which not only are slim to flat net margin businesses, but given demographics, are likely the fastest growing part of their patient panel.

**Fee schedule acts as a ‘guard rail’ to outsized unit costs**
For providers taking risk, the fee schedule in government programs also acts as a guard rail’ to outsized unit costs. Because the provider can be responsible for all healthcare costs associated with the member, if the member goes to a specialist or hospital with outsized unit costs (which can be as high as 300%-600% of Medicare costs) the provider taking the risk is on the hook. Therefore in commercial, this lack of consistent rates between providers can lower visibility into effectively managing down MLR. For government programs, even in wider networks like PPOs the unit costs are more consistent and therefore easier to manage/predict.

**Capitated providers get paid as a percentage of premiums**
Unlike FFS rate negotiations between insurers and FFS providers, pricing for capitated providers is generally done as a percentage of premiums rather than on a negotiated rate per service. This is because the provider is guaranteeing to keep costs below a certain level and, just like an insurer, it requires the premiums paid in to cover those costs. Of course, the insurer cannot pass on all the premiums (or else it would earn no margin and not be able to cover it G&A), and therefore there is a negotiation process to determine the amount.

**Insurance companies are regulated to spend a minimum amount on claims**
An important ratio to watch is the medical loss ratio (MLR, also sometimes referred to as the medical cost ratio or MCR, or the Medical Benefits Ratio or MBR), which represents the percent of the premium that the company spends on medical costs. Insurance companies must comply with a minimum MLR requirement (85% in Medicare Advantage), by spending at least 85% of premiums on benefits. If the MLR falls below this level, the MCO rebates the difference back to the government.

**However, capitated providers are unregulated with no profit cap**
Notably, capitated providers are not regulated the same way that insurance companies are and therefore have no minimum required spending on medical claims or profit cap, even if that provider group is owned by the insurance company capitating claims to itself (hence the widespread interest in insurers acquiring capitated providers).

**Minimum MLR acts as partial floor to capitation pricing**
Essentially, the minimum MLR acts as a gross profit margin cap for insurers. Therefore, it also acts as a strong reference point in negotiating capitated contracts with providers because capitation payments are included as medical costs in the MLR calculation. Therefore, if an MCO delegates all its medical costs to a capitated provider, the lowest it can capitate that risk out to is 85%. However, it’s a little more complicated because minimum MLR is calculated at the contract level for insurers, therefore insurance companies can capitate membership at lower than 85% if there are other members still in fee for service arrangements with higher MLR to offset it. For example, a health plan with half of its members in FFS arrangements at 87% MLR could capitate the other half of its membership at 83% and still be operating at the 85% MLR floor.

**In the short term, physicians hold the cards, but MCOs still have pricing power**
Due to the very short supply of sophisticated provider groups willing to take risk, MCOs are happy to pay 85% MLR, since there are very few alternatives in most markets. Given the nascent capitation market, this is likely to remain true for the next several years. However, over the longer term there is a risk that if there are multiple risk-taking groups in a market, an MCO would have pricing power to be able to go lower than the 85% rate to 84% or 80% etc. Regardless the minimum MLR still acts as a partial price floor and helps align incentives between insurers/capitated providers, as otherwise insurers would continually seek to push capitated rates lower every time a physician demonstrated that they can generate savings (85% -> 80% -> 75% etc.)

**Provider networks**
One of the key levers to control costs that MCOs have is the ability to construct provider networks. To be clear, when we refer to networks, we are referring to a large group of providers (eg, hospitals, labs, physicians, drug costs) which insurers contract with to provide care to its members at a negotiated rate or ‘unit costs’. Insurers use their scale to negotiate discounts in return for steering patients to providers. In addition, MCOs can save money by tailoring their networks to prioritize high quality providers and exclude low quality providers. Finally, the more patients you send to a provider, the more likely the provider is to follow your medical management protocols (because you are a key client), which can further help reduce costs.

In general, insurer contracts with providers last for about three years with built in increases. This increases visibility for the insurers and makes it easier for them to price their policies each year, while shifting risk to providers in years when inflation accelerates faster than expected.

**Networks, “unit costs” are a key differentiator for insurers**
Networks are often the biggest point of differentiation for insurers, since all else equal, the insurer with the lowest unit costs can charge the lowest premiums and take market share. This becomes a virtuous cycle as plans that gain share, can then use that scale to negotiate even bigger discounts and gain more share. It’s worth noting that national scale isn’t as important as local scale, as healthcare delivery is generally localized and a provider in New York City won’t give a discount if you are big in California. Meanwhile, since beneficiaries typically seek care within 10-30 miles of their home, in order for an insurer to offer a competitive plan that is attractive to the consumer, they will need to have the largest nearby hospital in-network at the lowest possible rate.

**Network size influences the costs**
Below we walk through two of the most common, broad categories of plan designs, which are differentiated based on the size of provider networks.

**PPO = Preferred Provider Organization.** A health benefits plan that allows an individual to choose any provider without designating a primary care physician (PCP), but offers higher levels of coverage to those who choose participating or preferred physicians or hospitals. In today’s market, when people have a health issue, they prefer to see whatever provider they want, whenever they want and as a result employers ask MCOs to design benefit structures that have broad network access, making PPOs increasingly popular, especially among commercial employers. MCOs have responded to market demands, and today many managed care companies boast of having networks that cover over 90% of providers. However, in providing broad networks, MCOs have given up their best tool for managing costs and are left trying to rein in costs with one hand tied behind their back. With a PPO plan, the provider can negotiate more aggressively since it knows that managed care cannot effectively steer patients away (the whole point of a PPO is that the patient has choice) so it is less willing to give up price in return for an uncertain volume benefit. Meanwhile, as providers align with multiple carriers, getting buy-in on one MCO’s medical management initiatives becomes incrementally more difficult.

**HMO = Health Maintenance Organization.** Covered members are required to use only the providers in the network. Members are also assigned primary care physicians (PCP) who manage the member’s overall care and issue referrals for specialized care that they do not provide. A tightly managed HMO network can be as much as 30%+ cheaper than a broad network PPO. Medicaid HMOs (where states empower plans to medically manage patients) routinely save 10-20% versus fee for service spending. All of the evidence indicates that tight networks that limit choice are required for effective cost management and we are starting to see MCOs offer plans with narrower networks, although this remains easier to do for small group employers (whose employees all live around a central location) than for a national employer (who would require a nation-wide network of numerous localized narrow networks).

**Medicare Advantage introduces provider networks to Medicare**
While the original Medicare program is entirely run by the federal government, Medicare Advantage is operated by private health insurers, but paid for and heavily regulated by the government. Essentially the key difference is that MA plans bring the concept of provider network from the commercial market into Medicare. Instead of being able to see virtually any doctor in the country, seniors in MA have a much narrower set of providers to choose from. MCOs then use the cost savings that they generate to fund additional benefits that traditional Medicare doesn’t cover, to encourage people to switch into their plan.

**MCOs negotiate rates with providers based on government fee schedule**
As mentioned above, Medicare Advantage plans can base rates relative to what the government has decided to pay under Original Medicare. Therefore, often providers agree to accept rates +/- 1-25% of the Original Medicare rate schedule for a Medicare Advantage plan. In most cases the providers accept rates slightly lower than the Original Medicare fee schedule in exchange for the higher volumes an MA plan can send to the provider.

**Network adequacy can give providers more leverage**
In some cases, however, the MA plan will agree to pay more than what a provider would receive under Original Medicare. A common reason that a provider might be able to get better rates would be in order for the MA plan to fulfil its network adequacy requirements. While MA plans are able to create narrow networks, one of the regulatory requirements an MA plan must meet is that its networks must be deemed ‘adequate’ by the regulator, which essentially means it must have enough providers of each specialty within each geography for the member to access. Therefore, if there are only one or two providers of a specialty in a geography such as a dialysis clinic, or even primary care group, the MA plan might need the provider in network to be able to offer an MA plan, giving that provider more leverage to negotiate higher rates.

**‘High Value’ providers may be able to secure higher rates**
Another scenario where a provider might secure higher than Medicare rates is if the MA plan deems the provider to be ‘high value’. Ultimately, providers are treating seniors who often have complex health conditions. Therefore the true ‘cost’ of a provider may be higher than the cost of paying for the provider visit. For example a ‘low value’ provider may refer patients’ additional unnecessary services to boost its own revenue, or simply misdiagnose patients which can lead to a deterioration in patient health and eventual expensive hospital admissions. Therefore, insurers track outcomes of their patients among various providers and may be willing to pay more for visits to ‘high value’ providers in order to generate other cost savings.

A corollary to this would be that providers who have the market perception of high quality might also be able to negotiate higher prices. For example, a teaching hospital might be viewed by local residents as a “must have” provider in network, so the MCO may have to include a provider for commercial/marketing reasons, even if their own data doesn’t indicate there is particular value.

**Benefit design**
In Medicare Advantage, based on the benchmark, risk adjustment payments and quality scores an insurer can decide to adjust its benefit design as it sees necessary to cover its forecasted costs and tweak its benefit offerings based on whether rates match trend (higher revenue can cover more benefits). In this section we walk through the types of benefits insurance plans offer enrollees and the downstream implications for margins at capitated providers.

**MA plans able to offer more benefits at lower cost**
Despite the additional network restrictions under Medicare Advantage, seniors choose these plans because of extra benefits provided relative to Medicare FFS. Potentially the biggest benefit provided by MA is that there is an out-of-pocket maximum ($7,550 in 2022 for in-network expenses), while in traditional FFS, there is no limit to how much cost sharing a member could be subject to – since most seniors are on a fixed budget, this certainty is incredibly valuable. In addition, about 89% of MA enrollment are in plans that offer prescription drug coverage, providing a one stop shop for seniors so that they do not have to purchase a separate prescription drug plan. Other extra benefits include reduced cost sharing, lower premiums and other benefits such as dental and vision insurance coverage.

**…while also offering additional supplemental benefits**
The analysis above does not even take into account the additional benefits that Medicare Advantage plans typically cover which are not included under original Medicare. For example, 97% of plans offer vision, 94% offer hearing, 94% offer fitness, and 91% offer dental benefits. Therefore, not only is MA cheaper on a same-benefit basis, but MA also gives the seniors these additional benefits which make the economics to the individual that much more compelling.

**Benefit improvements a headwind to physician pricing**
One thing that is not intuitive about capitated providers is the fact that as benefits get more and more generous, physicians are generally less likely to manage these supplemental benefits (laid out in the chart above) for an MCO. It would be very difficult for a provider to ‘manage down’ the cost of a gym membership or OTC benefit, therefore these benefits are typically structured as a pass-through payment. For example, a capitated provider would be responsible for paying out the gym membership, but would be charged the same amount that the MCO bid, so the provider would earn essentially 0% margin on that revenue.

Over time, MCOs have increased the rebate dollars given to MA beneficiaries as a percentage of the benchmark, in order to attract and retain membership. However, this means that the percentage of total spending flowing into core medical expenses is declining. This implies MCOs are getting increasingly confident in their ability to manage down core medical costs, baking those savings into actuarial bids and passing those savings to consumers to differentiate their offerings.

In the exhibit below, we highlight these dynamics by showing the differences in economics between an average HMO plan rebating $158 of the benchmark as benefits and a hypothetically more aggressive plan rebating 25% more benefits. Notably, since rebates are funded by plans bidding below the benchmark (eg saying they can cover the core medical benefits at a lower cost), as the rebates (extra benefits for beneficiaries) increases, the core medical benefit revenue dollars decreases. Therefore, a provider in this example getting 85% capitation on an average HMO plan would be getting 82% of the core bid, whereas a more aggressive MCO benefit structure would drop the medical portion to just 81%. This has the effect of shrinking gross margins from 40% to 35% on the same base of medical costs because the MCO is essentially passing a portion of the provider margin to the beneficiary.

**Providers negotiate net rates to reflect benefit designs**
Of course, capitated providers are aware of this dynamic and generally negotiate contracts with each insurer to reflect net reimbursement inclusive of changes in benefit designs. Therefore, capitated provider rate negotiations are really no different from how any typical FFS provider would negotiate rates with Managed Care in that the negotiations are driven by which party has more leverage.

**MA industry rate headwinds don’t automatically flow to providers**
Having a stake in benefit design can also be a positive. Since negotiated rates between capitated providers and insurers are effectively discussed net of certain rebates, if there are fluctuations in industry MA reimbursement rates one way or the other, capitated provider MLR’s are not materially impacted. This is because in a strong rate environment, insurers will expand benefits, offsetting rate tailwinds. Meanwhile, in periods of weak rates (such as the proposed 2024 MA rate), insurers will slow or cut benefits, which mitigates the actual rate headwind.

After the MA industry got a stronger than expected 2023 rate, OSH confirmed this dynamic by reiterating its per patient economics would likely not be impacted. In general, the benefits dynamic prevents any adverse MLR impact from rate headwinds (which comprise 60-90% of a capitated provider’s revenue) but there could be some modest G&A leverage gained or lost if rates continue to fluctuate, particularly over an extended period.

**Question (Industry Analyst):** For fiscal '23, the Medicare Advantage advance rate notice looked pretty good in terms of expected change in revenue for MA plans, coming in well above 2022. Just any thoughts around that?

**Answer (Oak Street):** I think one thing to always keep in mind is that we are one step removed from kind of the benchmark and rate changes because the health plans is in the middle. And the health plan actually provides a buffering mechanism when you think about Oak Street economics.

And so, to the extent that rates go up, generally plans will take some of that increase and invest it in better benefits for patients, which obviously to the conversation we had earlier in the calls is in our benefit, right, because it will drive more MA penetration and more patients on risk for Oak Street. But from an economic Oak Street perspective, we view that our revenue goes up, so our medical costs will largely offset.

And so, maybe it happens if there's a worse rate increase notice. It wouldn't have necessarily a negative impact on our per patient economics, because the same buffering mechanism exists. And so, again, I think we are less sensitive to those types of things let's say a health plan. – 4Q21 Earnings Call Transcript (Bloomberg)

**PPO plans outgrowing HMO**
Another dynamic worth mentioning is that PPO plans have been outgrowing HMO plans in recent years. The shift from more tightly managed HMO plans to broader network PPO plans makes it somewhat more difficult for the physician group to manage utilization and keep downstream referrals within their preferred networks (since patients can choose other providers who they might not realize are inefficient or lower quality). We note that capitated providers as a whole have indicated that they make the same money on HMO and PPO members and it appears that part of the way that they do this is that the rate is higher (since PPO plans offer fewer supplemental benefits than HMOs, but offers more provider choice), allowing for a lower margin to get to the same dollar profitability. In addition, it’s worth noting that although technically patients have access to a broader network in a PPO plan, a capitated provider’s higher patient engagement and outreach means that the patients would largely use the system the same way whether in an HMO or PPO network, but clearly this requires more work and has greater potential variability in cost. Meanwhile, member growth could be impacted by PPO growth, as all HMO plans require the patient to have a primary care doctor, while not only do PPO plans have more providers to choose from, but most do not even require a member to have a PCP, meaning that patients would have to proactively choose a capitated doctor group more often.

## Comparing reimbursement types
To summarize, below we review how each of the concepts we reviewed in this section ‘rank’ in terms of attractiveness to the physician by program to highlight the key reasons why one program would make more sense for value-based care adoption. In particular we look at 10 key variables of program design: 1) High Spending per beneficiary 2) Generous Benchmarks 3) Generous Risk Adjustment 4) Quality bonuses 5) Narrow Networks 6) Low Variability of Fee Schedule 7) Low Churn 8) National Standardization 9) Alignment with Providers 10) Alignment with MCO.

**Legend:** Most Favorable, Semi-favorable, Least Favorable, N/A

**1) High spending per beneficiary**
The higher the amount of spending, the more opportunity there is to close gaps in care and drive cost savings. Medicare patients are generally the sickest, followed by high acuity Medicaid. However, a large portion of Medicaid patients (TANF, Expansion) are young patients with low levels of spending.

**2) Generous benchmark**
From the provider perspective,tying the benchmark spending level to regional expenditures or the performance of external actors is preferable because that means that reimbursement isn’t driven down when the provider lowers costs, i.e. less ‘suffering from success’.

**Regional versus historical benchmarking**
As outlined in the benchmarking methodology section above, Medicare Advantage plans are paid based on what it costs the federal government to treat similar patients in each geography. This approach is referred to as a ‘regional benchmark’. A critical component of this approach is that the regional benchmark is calculated using an average across a group of beneficiaries rather than the specific beneficiaries of an insurer. The significance of this nuance is that if an insurer or capitated provider is successful in doing its job at lowering medical costs, that lower spending level is not immediately reflected in a lower benchmark as the benchmark is based on the performance of others, which in this case is the federal government itself.

Essentially, the main alternative to the regional benchmark, is one based on historical expenditures. Under a historical expenditure approach, benchmarks are set using actual medical spending of covered beneficiaries. Therefore if an insurer or capitated provider is successful in lowering medical costs, the benchmark is adjusted downward based on savings generated, and it does eventually become more difficult to consistently generate additional savings / profit. These programs are still profitable for provider groups, but are structurally not as attractive capitation in Medicare Advantage.

**Historical benchmarks and ‘suffering from success’**
To drive this point home, below we walk through two illustrative P&L examples of capitation under commercial and Medicare Advantage. In the first example, we show a hypothetical and simplified P&L under commercial capitation, which essentially utilizes a historical expenditures benchmarking approach. In year 1, the insurance company’s premiums are $6,300 on average for a commercial patient. That insurer turns around and capitates the premiums at 85% (minimum MLR) to the capitated provider. That provider is able to manage down costs 30% and generate $1,607 of annual cost savings / gross margin. After a 15% G&A load, the provider earns a 15% EBITDA margin.

However, because the provider successfully lowered the medical spending of a patient, and commercial premiums are set based on historical experience of actual covered beneficiaries, the insurer would no longer want to pay the capitated provider a rate higher than actual costs and would need to realize some of those savings itself to pass savings to the employer. If we assume the insurer cuts rates by 25% of the savings, the provider will see a 6% rate cut year over year. Even if that provider is able to find further savings, it will lose fixed cost leverage and compress EBITDA margins down to 13%. By year 5 this cycle of rate cutting will compress capitated provider margins down to just 7%.

**MA benchmark is unaffected by beneficiary experience**
Meanwhile, in Medicare Advantage, because plans are paid by the government based on a regional benchmark of unmanaged Original Medicare beneficiaries, the savings they generate don’t impact reimbursement. In this example, regardless of how well capitated providers manage down costs, CMS will still pay the MA plan the ever increasing benchmark rate. Additionally, since MA plans have a minimum MLR of 85% they are happy to continue capitating the provider at the same % rate as they continue to earn their maximum gross profit and maintain the same relative advantage versus other plans, whereas in commercial there is no floor to lowering costs which allows the insurer to offer a more competitive cost structure versus competitors.

**Real world example shows differences in profitability**
Interestingly, CMS released performance data from the first year of Direct Contracting in 2021 (now called ACO REACH). Within the data, CMS broke out individual company performance as well as the categorization for program reimbursement. ‘New Entrant’ participants were paid on a benchmark based entirely on a regional benchmark, meanwhile ‘Standard’ participants were paid mostly on historical expenditures (65% historical/35% regional on existing members, but regional on any new members added in year).

As expected, partially due to the more generous benchmark, New Entrant participants materially outperformed on Medical Margin or gross profit ($54) versus Standard DCEs ($10). This is true despite the fact that average per member per month costs at Standard DCEs is 19% lower than at New Entrant DCEs.

This dynamic is likely driven by the fact that standard DCEs have been better at engaging patients for some time now and therefore have been able to lower medical costs further. However, these lower costs are also reflected in a much lower revenue benchmark, leading to lower gross profitability even though technically standard DCEs appear to have been more successful in lowering medical costs.

**3) Generous risk adjustment**
Risk adjustment is critical to value-based care as otherwise it becomes difficult to treat sick patients with abnormally high expenses. Government programs generally have programs that account for these dynamics, but the commercial employer market has no standardized process.

**Risk adjustment varies by program**
Risk adjustment mechanisms work best when there is central authority such as the government to standardize the estimated cost of treating a diabetes patient for example. Otherwise, private market insurers and providers would struggle to agree on individually adjusted rates. Therefore, in the commercial employer market there essentially is no widely used standard of risk adjustment. We note that in the commercial individual markets, Medicaid, and Original Medicare programs (MSSP / DCE / ACO REACH) there are similar mechanisms for risk adjustment but have more limitations and guardrails in place versus what exists in Medicare Advantage.

**4) Benchmark increase, versus quality withhold**
The Medicare Advantage stars program establishes quality payments as a bonus, meaning that it raises the benchmark. However, most other government programs structure quality payments as a ‘withhold’ meaning that the benchmark is discounted upfront by some amount (usually low single digits) and must be earned back subject to certain quality metrics. For the most part this is the same end result (high payments for quality), however the withhold payments impact performance within the same year whereas in Medicare Advantage quality bonuses from the government to insurers are paid out on a three-year lag.

As mentioned above, even if a program such as commercial employer risk does not have a standardized quality program, it is common for insurers to pay providers quality bonuses based on individual performance, though it could vary dramatically by specific contract terms.

**5) Narrow networks**
By having provider networks, particularly HMOs, it clearly defines member attribution (To the PCP) and helps control volumes by requiring patients to visit the PCP for referrals to providers, while also keeping utilization away from low value/high cost providers. In Original Medicare programs like MSSP/ACO REACH there is no network at all, while in the employer market open access products are common.

**Rates/networks vary widely by program**
To review, Commercial rates paid to providers can be multiple times that of the Medicare fee schedule, while Medicaid rates are typically even further below that. Meanwhile, network sizes are a key tool for MCOs to control costs and range from literally no networks at all in Original Medicare (patients can see any hospital) to tightly managed HMOs in private insurance plans (MA, Medicaid, Commercial), though Medicaid tends to have the tightest HMO networks, followed by Medicare Advantage and Commercial Individual Risk as commercial employers generally offer PPOs or wider HMOs.

As noted above these dynamics have implications for value-based providers as it is easier to manage risk when there is a rate schedule from the government (keeping costs between providers consistent) and narrower networks (preventing patients from seeking out higher cost providers).

|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Medicare Shared Savings Program | Government mandated FFS rates, completely open networks.                                                                        |
| ACO REACH                 | Government mandated FFS rates, completely open networks.                                                                        |
| Managed Medicaid          | Insurer negotiated rates, deep discount to Medicare Fee Schedule, MCO based networks. largely HMO based.                        |
| Commercial Employer Risk  | Insurer negotiated rates, large premium to Medicare Fee Schedule, MCO based networks. PPO majority, some HMO.                   |
| Commercial Individual Risk | Insurer negotiated rates, large premium to Medicare Fee Schedule. MCO based networks, largely HMO based.                        |
| Commercial ASO            | Insurer negotiated rates, large premium to Medicare Fee Schedule. MCO based networks, PPO majority, some HMO.                   |

**6) Low variability of fee schedule**
Because the provider can be responsible for all healthcare costs associated with the member, if the member goes to a specialist or hospital with outsized unit costs (which can be as high as 300%-600% of Medicare costs) the provider taking the risk is on the hook. Therefore in commercial, this lack of consistent rates between providers can lower visibility into effectively managing down MLR.

**7) Low churn**
Value based care requires a high degree of upfront investment (time to document conditions, set up care management programs) which can take 6-18 months to pay off. Therefore, programs with patient low churn have a greater opportunity to see those investments realized. Interestingly, Medicare Advantage has the lowest churn rate of any major insurance product.

**Exhibit 75: Medicare Advantage has the lowest churn of any insurance product, allowing longer term investments in value based care**

| Insurance Product          | Estimated Annual Churn Rate (%) |
|:---------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| Commercial Employer Based  | 20%                             |
| Individual ACA             | 43%                             |
| Medicare Advantage         | 12%                             |
| Medicaid                   | 21%                             |

**8) National standardization**
National standardization is important in value-based care as it allows for national contracting with MCOs and simplified operating standards for risk taking providers. In Medicaid, each state can have wildly different standards while the employer market is particularly fragmented in terms of market share.

**9) Alignment with providers**
Commercial FFS rates are materially higher than Medicare and are the area of the business that already is categorically profitable. Therefore, most providers are less willing to take risk on commercial than they would on Medicare or Medicaid which are more breakeven margins and would make sense to have a new ‘solution’ for. Meanwhile, building a profitable business on Medicaid is difficult, so physicians often don’t put practices in lower income areas. As a result, often Medicaid patients utilize ‘Federally Qualified Health Centers’ which are partially funded by the federal government and more mission driven, less sophisticated on technology, and less focused on profit.

**10) Alignment with MCOs**
In Medicare Advantage, capitating to a physician at 85% MLR locks in the MCO’s maximum profit margin. Meanwhile, since physicians get paid 85% of premium, they are also incentivized to maximize revenue per member through driving higher risk codes and quality scores (5% bonus for high quality health plans). Physicians are incentivized to do this while maintaining high consumer satisfaction, further reducing churn in their and the MCO’s membership. The key here is that the rate that MCOs get paid (and physicians get 85% of), is tied to unmanaged government FFS, allowing for efficient providers to control costs and maintain a consistent spread of profits over time. In contrast, in the commercial employer risk business, there is a ‘suffering from success’ dynamic of lowering costs leading to a lower benchmark the following year. Meanwhile, in commercial ASO, the MCO is not actually on the hook for costs and it can be difficult to work on such a sophisticated concept such as VBC across a range of self-insured employers.

## Economic model, margins
Scale always matters, but (in contrast to fee for service) in value-based care, reimbursement is not as tied to how much market share a physician has in a market or even the fee-schedule itself. Instead, reimbursement is tied to how much of total spending a physician is willing to manage and how much risk that physician is willing to take. Therefore, the bigger drivers to profitability are maximizing the percentage of spend under management (increasing number of patients and percent of their spending under management), driving savings off that base, while managing operating costs at the clinic and corporate level.

Net Capitation Revenue – Third Party Medical Costs – Costs of operating clinic – Sales and marketing expense - Corporate G&A = EBITDA

**Capitated providers can earn a mid-teens EBITDA margin**
Full-capitation risk arrangements delegate financial risk from the health plans to the clinics, leaving the capitated provider fully responsible for healthcare costs associated with their patients, including the cost of care delivered by non-affiliated doctors, hospitals and other providers. In other words, a capitated provider group in many ways ‘becomes’ the health insurer from an economic perspective. To fund these new medical expense obligations, the MCO effectively passes through the majority of a patient’s premiums (typically 85% capitation rate in MA) to the capitated provider, locking in the remaining 15% of premium as gross profit. The capitated provider then uses its clinical staff, technology and corporate resources to engage patients to close gaps in care, redirect patients to lower cost of care settings and books the difference between premiums and costs as profit. Below we show an illustrative example of how a capitated provider could generate 12-23% EBITDA margins.

## Third Party Medical Costs, MLR
**Bridging to mid-teens EBITDA margins**
Below we show how OSH, the largest standalone public capitated provider, thinks about bridging to its long-term target margin range of 12-23%. First, it expects to spend 60-65% of premiums on third party medical expense, with 7-10% on running the clinic itself. From there, the company expects to spend 5-6% on sales and marketing, and 5-7% on corporate G&A.

**Peer companies have similar margin targets to OSH**
CANO (OSH’s closest standalone peer) sees a similar margin target of ~15%, while AGL (the largest standalone affiliate model company) sees margins in the 10-13% range. This makes sense because AGL’s affiliate model inherently has lower margins because of how it splits the savings with its physician partners (which we explain in a later section). Meanwhile, CANO’s business mix is split 50/50 between the clinic/affiliate model. Therefore, CANO’s clinic margin target definitionally must be similar to OSH, since 50% of its revenue should have margins closer to 10-13%.

**Mature companies like UNH/HUM have proven margins at scale**
For companies like AGL, CANO, and OSH it can be easy for investors discount the long-term margin targets as none of them have achieved them on a consolidated basis at scale. However, to some degree the margins have already been proven as achievable by UNH, the largest capitated physician group in the country (by far). Greater than 70% of UNH’s OptumHealth segment is driven by capitated revenue and the segment has consistently operated within UNH’s 8-10% EBIT margin guidance for the segment (9-11% EBITDA). This is true even though UNH is still growing overall segment revenue in the 25-30% range and similar to peers, UNH acknowledges that new revenue comes in at a negative margin and takes time to ramp to target margin.

Meanwhile, HUM (the 2nd largest Medicare Advantage insurer) is also aggressively building out a capitated physician business and talks about generating similar margins to the targets laid out by CANO/OSH (although it is currently operating closer to break even today).

**Clinics needs to manage costs better than the health plan**
Underpinning the economic model of capitated arrangements is the fact that capitated physician groups can manage down healthcare costs more efficiently than just the health plan. For example the public capitated providers (AGL, CANO, CMAX, and OSH) which don’t own insurance plans,talk about savings versus the Original Medicare benchmark and report -42% and -52% reductions in hospital admissions/ER visits on average, though we note this is an easier benchmark to compare against since MA plans actively manage down utilization as well, so their savings what UNH might generate in its fee for service pool would be lower.

| CMAX | -52% | -74% |

| ONEM (Iora) | -35% | -33% |
| PIII | -36% | -52% |
| Average | -42% | -52% |

**Value-based physicians engage members more heavily in primary care**
To achieve these outcomes, clinic models invest significantly more into their primary care platform than the average fee for service physician, utilizing a proprietary IT platform, larger care teams, smaller patient panels (more time spent with patients) and back office staff to coordinate and close gaps in care for the patient. According to a report from HUM, the average MA patient spends about 6.4% of premiums on primary care, while patients engaged in value-based care spend about 14.3%.

**JAMA study points to improvement in clinical outcomes**
Optum has published a more scientific study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), on the clinical value of two-sided risk arrangements. In the study Optum compared results across 316,312 individuals, half of which were enrolled in Original Medicare, the other half of which were enrolled in a two-sided accountable MA arrangement. Based on the study, Optum found an -18% reduction in inpatient admissions and -14% reduction in avoidable emergency department visits. These results point to less dramatic changes versus what some of the startup companies report, but are impressive nonetheless. Additionally, we note that the study acknowledges some or all of the benefit may be due to the Medicare Advantage network structure, rather than intervention by incented providers.

**How exactly do capitated providers lower MLR?**
At times it can sound like the capitation model is too good to be true. If MCOs sometimes struggle to manage costs down to 85% how are capitated models able to earn a margin when their reimbursement only starts after the MCO takes a 15% margin? In the sections above we touched on some of the key drivers such as risk coding and keeping members out of the hospital. Taking this a step further, we explain the types of things that capitated physician execute on to achieve ~61% clinic level MLR on a lower premium base in an illustrative example (below). We note we are comparing the clinic performance to the FFS Medicare program instead of the MA benchmark as the data is publicly available, therefore the cost saves include MA unit discounts and other actions MCOs are taking on their own, but still reflect the savings needed.

**Lower Benchmark.** First, we assume Original Medicare benchmark is equal to Medicare Advantage (in theory the reimbursement philosophy of the program) but then adjust down that benchmark (excluding hospice as MA does not pay for hospice) 15% to account for the 85% provider capitation rate. This is a headwind to MLR as it lowers the denominator.

**Increase risk coding/Stars bonus.** From there, we assume the capitated provider is able to increase premiums through risk coding by 7% and that the clinic model is able to engage patients, better capture quality metrics to increase MA plan scores, and reimbursement (another +5%). Importantly, the capitated provider retains 85% of these premium increases. These are large MLR tailwinds as they raise the denominator.

**Reducing hospital spending.** The largest source of potential medical cost savings comes from keeping patients out of the hospital. The public companies (AGL, AMEH, CANO, CMAX, OSH, ONEM, PIII) report that on average they are able to lower hospital admissions -42% and ER visits by -52%. We use these as a proxy for inpatient/outpatient volume declines and further assume the capitated provider is able to get a 5% discount on unit costs from the MA plan network design.

**PCP spending is effectively near $0.** Since clinic model MLR is calculated using third party medical expenses, it doesn’t include the cost of running the clinic and PCP services. Therefore we assume a 100% reduction in primary care volumes since the capitated provider members would use the capitated provider for PCP services and is accounted for outside of MLR (instead included in the costs of running the clinic). This means that the MLR metrics at capitated providers are not directly comparable to the way MCOs report since MCOs include the cost of delivering primary care.

**Provide more ‘specialist’ services, direct to high value docs where needed.** Aside from furnishing traditional primary care, a capitated provider clinic could provide many ‘specialist services’ in-house. For example, patients with a heart problem often seek out care at expensive cardiologists only to be told to take easily accessible medications to manage their condition. Capitated providers are able to utilize the same heart diagnostic equipment to manage many of the low acuity cardiology patients and redirect to lower cost outside specialists when needed. In this example we assume the capitated provider is able to reduce Physician visits by 10% (since many of the external services would be redundant) as well as get 10% better unit costs from steering patients towards high value specialists when patients do need external care.

**Engage patients in home health, while getting lower unit costs.** The capitated provider groups generally furnish their own version of home health services by sending nurses and doctors into the home, which is also not accounted for as a third-party medical expense, therefore we assume the capitated provider can reduce home health volumes by 20%. Meanwhile in cases where home health is needed, home health companies are willing to take steep discounts (~20%) versus FFS in exchange for volumes.

**Lower utilization and get better rates at SNFs.** By avoiding acute inpatient admissions, and proactively engaging patients, the capitated provider is able to reduce need for SNFs (we assume -15%) and get better MA rate versus FFS (-20%). MA plans are also able to move patients out of SNFs earlier and into home care setting (typically can reduce length of stay in a SNF by up to 1/3).

**Prescribing drugs a key tool, switching to generics.** Switching patients from a branded drug to a low-cost generic can typically save 85% on costs with similar outcomes. We assume the doctor would be able to replace 33% of a patient’s drug use to generics, resulting in 28% savings (85%*33%). Conversely, doctors who manage the whole cost of care can balance the high cost of a drug versus potential cost savings in medical expenses by prescribing patients a slightly more expensive but more effective drugs that help a patient better manage chronic conditions and stay out of the hospital, resulting in net cost savings. Additionally, providers often have on-site pharmacies or relationships with mail order pharmacies to deliver drugs directly to the patient and increase medication adherence.

**Capitated provider needs to drive ~42% medical cost saving versus FFS**
Altogether, using the assumptions outlined above, the capitated provider would be able to raise its premium slightly from risk coding and quality metrics (but still have a lower benchmark than FFS/MCO) and lower medical expenses 42% resulting in a 61% MLR. We note a decent chunk of the savings comes from things an MA plan should already be doing such as getting better unit costs and running site of care shift initiatives. However, the provider is still adding value to the MA plan by removing medical cost volatility, and by having a more direct relationship with the patient, which improves the level of adherence / reimbursement, and keeps patients out of the hospital, which is the largest source of savings.

**MCO is driving a large chunk of savings**
We note our analysis above talks about capitated providers earnings a 61% MLR versus the Original Medicare benchmark, and those required savings (40%+) screen as difficult to achieve. However, that analysis does not take into account the savings that MCOs are already generating (and would be within the 40%+) through network design, unit cost discounts, prior authorization, medical management initiatives etc. While this amount is impossible to separate from what the doctor is generating, we can find some indications by analyzing the amount of rebates MCOs receive in the MA plan. This is because rebates are earned only when an MCO bids below the benchmark, and is therefore confident it can save enough money to do so and earn a reasonable return. If we divide those rebates by average Medicare beneficiary spending in a given year and adjust it for CMS’s average rebate take-rate of 35%, it implies that MCOs are bidding 7-22% below the benchmark depending on the plan type. Unsurprisingly, MCOs are more confident generating savings in closed HMO networks versus completely open PFFS networks. In fact, there is a clear correlation between how narrow the network is, and the amount of savings the MCO can generate (and therefore the amount of benefits it can provide). The 7-9% savings in the Private FFS and Regional PPO plans (largely unnetworked and not capitated) would be the floor for the savings that the MCO itself can generate, with the true number likely closer to the 20% average range.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2016 | 12% | 15% | 7% | 4% | 3% |
| 2017 | 13% | 16% | 9% | 6% | 2% |

| 2022 | 20% | 22% | 19% | 7% | 2% |

**Capitated providers competing versus MCO bid rather than benchmark**
Given that a large portion of membership is still not in a capitated arrangement today, it means that much of these savings are being driven by the MCO itself, without any help from value-based physicians. Therefore, the capitation rate paid to providers on a dollar basis will likely hover around the level by which MCOs can control their own costs to confidently bid versus the benchmark. Said otherwise, if an MCO can generate 20% savings on its FFS members, it will bid 20% below the benchmark, and offer that price (net of rebates) to the capitated provider, which must then manage costs lower. If the MCO eventually generates 25% savings on its own, it would lower its bid, and the capitated provider would see a rate cut (still earnings 85% capitation rate but now on a lower bid). Therefore, there will always be some conflict between capitated provider’s wanting MCOs to keep benefits more stable, and MCOs wanting to flow through savings to beneficiaries (at the expense of capitated providers) to grow membership.

**MLR takes years to ramp down, 60-70% LT target**
We note that lowering MLR at the clinic level can take years as new members often get onboarded with minimal risk adjustment documentation (which impacts the denominator, premiums) and largely unmanaged chronic conditions (which impacts the numerator, medical costs) which both take time to change. Meanwhile, filling newly built clinics or provider group panels with new patients also takes time to ramp. The rapid growth in new members (who come in at high MLR) can mask the underlying improvement in MLR at members who have been in the system for the past couple of years.

**Public companies have disclosed MLR unit economics**
A couple of public companies have disclosed enough public data to help illustrate quantitatively how MLRs can progress over time. For example, Iora (a subsidiary of ONEM which has been acquired by Amazon) has disclosed that across four cohorts in 2017-2020 MLR has progressed down from an average of 102% in year one to 76% by year four. Meanwhile, AGL discloses contribution margin PMPM (revenue – medical costs) by cohort from 2018-2021, which we translate into MLR by assuming a capitation rate (based on regional benchmarks * 85%). This data implies AGL can ramp down MLR from 96% on average in year one down to 77%/81% in YR3/YR4 (year four data skewed by COVID impact). At CMAX, the company talks about patients coming online at 107% MLR, which decline to 65%/85% by year four depending on the relationship with the patient (clinic versus affiliate model). Finally, CANO disclosed an expected MLR ramp (not clear how closely tied it is to actual performance) of an MA member over time which we model against center membership ramp/churn assumptions to imply a clinic level MLR over time, which we estimate to be 81% in year one down to 67% in year five.

**Less underwriting risk than MCOs from diversification**
Given that capitated providers are getting paid a percentage of premiums, and MCOs are estimating those premiums (or net benefits in the case of MA), capitated providers are technically exposed to the same underwriting risk that MCOs are. If the MCO mis-estimates cost trend, its possible net reimbursement will be too low for the capitated provider to cover its costs. However, the good news is that capitated providers are much more diversified versus any single MCO as they generally have contracts with many MCOs in many different markets, lowering the likelihood that in aggregate, reimbursement would be too low to cover costs. This also means that its patient TAM grows with the industry growth rate and isn’t tied to one particular MCO growing. Finally, when asked about broader industry utilization trends (a key driver of MCO earnings), management teams of capitated providers groups often respond by saying they are more in control of costs versus an insurance company and that utilization doesn’t just ‘happen’ to them (since patients/doctors are highly engaged).

**Sicker/lower income population is more profitable**
One of the less intuitive concepts for investors new to the space is the fact that the sicker and less engaged a patient is prior to joining a clinic, the better it is for long term profitability. Essentially this is due to risk adjustment. The Medicare Advantage program is set up in a way to properly reimburse plans (and therefore capitated providers) to take risk on every kind of Medicare patient, including very sick ones, which requires more premium dollars to cover higher claims.

**Wider opportunity to close risk adjustment gap rewards provider**
This is done by submitting health documentation codes to the government, and in turn receiving higher payments for every incremental documentation code. For the sickest, least engaged patients, there is a wider delta of codes needed to be submitted which rewards a provider who can find the patients and close that gap, particularly in geographies with other high cost, unengaged patients (because the benchmark is set based on costs of other beneficiaries in a region).

**Sicker patients have more costs, greater opportunity to close gaps in care**
Additionally, the sicker a patient is, the more touchpoints of care there are, and therefore there are more opportunities to close potential gaps in care and save money. For example, a high-cost patient may regularly go to the hospital to receive non-emergent care such as infusions, or specialist visits. Instead, the capitated provider can re-direct care to home or outpatient settings. Even a simple example such as switching a patient from a high-cost specialty drug to a generic drug could drive meaningful cost savings.

**Value based providers often breaking healthcare ‘deserts’**
It’s worth noting that providers in value-based care are uniquely positioned to serve members in low-income areas. Often, these new clinics being built are the only primary care offices to be located in low-income urban areas (aside from federally qualified ‘community’ health centers which are generally underfunded). This is because under fee-for-service, serving the affluent higher income population with commercial insurance is significantly (3-4x) more profitable, and therefore most of the existing primary care capacity has been built in affluent areas outside of urban centers. This leaves room for capitated physician groups to build capacity in underserved areas and relatively easily onboard new patients who previously had no comparable nearby options (versus trying to get a patient in a more affluent area to switch doctors from their long-term provider). Those low-income areas also tend to be in urban centers, which are population dense which makes it easier to ramp clinic capacity.

**Criticisms about risk score ‘coding shops’**
As we touched on in the reimbursement section, there has been a criticism lobbed against the capitated provider industry that the groups are generating most of the MLR improvement through risk adjustment rather than medical cost savings. In our view, the criticisms are somewhat exaggerated, though higher risk adjustment is clearly a critical piece of the model, and changes to the risk adjustment model could negative impact company margins.

Below we show a sensitivity table showing how much revenue and medical cost savings would be required to achieve the 61% MLR target we laid out. To be clear we are using $8,371 as the base of capitated premiums $9,848 ((Original Benchmark ex-hospice) * 85% (Capitation Rate)). Additionally, we are removing 6% or $591 to account for primary care costs which are not accounted for in MLR (would be recognized in operating expenses). To be clear in the example below, at 0% risk adjustment revenue increase, and 0% savings, MLR is 111% because the provider is capitated at 85%, but generating no incremental value, thus costs can be higher than reimbursement.

We note that programs like ACO REACH have a 3% annual risk adjustment growth cap and therefore implies that MA is higher than that. Meanwhile, CANO discloses that their MA PMPM at the member level has grown at a 7% CAGR, though that includes underlying growth in benchmark. If we take the midpoint and assume that capitated MA clinics do actually grow risk adjustment revenue at 5% a year over the first three years (where most risk adjustment codes are documented) would imply 15% revenue growth. That implies that capitated providers need to be saving at least 35% versus the benchmark to achieve 61% MLR.

**MSSP data highlights performance with minimal risk coding, weaker benchmark**
Interestingly, CMS annually publishes detailed results from the Medicare Shared Savings Program at the participant level. We looked at the data over the past 8 years and found that the top quartile of participants have consistently been able to deliver 7-9% savings versus the CMS benchmark. Companies like PRVA/OSH/VillageMD (now owned by WBA) have been able to perform within this range as well.

These 7-9% savings found in MSSP can be viewed as relatively ‘pure’ results, which have a very minimal contribution from risk score gaming. While 7-9% may pale in comparison to the 41% savings we outlined in our example of how a capitated provider can drive 61% MLR, we note that these are program wide results not individual results (mature patients are likely in the double digits). Additionally, the MSSP program has wide open networks as opposed to the narrow networks in Medicare Advantage which drive material cost savings on their own (and allow MCOs to offer richer benefits versus FFS – earlier we estimated that MCO actions can save 7-22% by themselves on a gross basis). Finally, the benchmarks in MSSP are materially less generous than MA as MSSP benchmark account for historical expenditures whereas MA is entirely based on a regional benchmark. Therefore, every year it becomes harder to generate savings in MSSP (as savings bring down historical expenditures over time) whereas in MA the core benchmark is not impacted by any
