**Client**
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about Ambience Healthcare. To kick things off, could you provide a little bit of background on yourself and your usage of Ambience and Abridge?

**Expert**
Yeah. I am the enterprise AI product manager, and so I cover a wide range of things across our network. Primarily, I'm responsible with the overall AI strategy, particularly as it relates to tools that have a generative AI component. I'm also the product manager for our Versa platform, which is our alternative to ChatGPT but within our network. I am a product management consultant to the AI health oversight and steering group. I have helped them scale their AI scribing program with Abridge.

I assume that you're relatively well-versed on the AI scribing category, so I won't go over the benefits of AI scribes. We have a long-standing mission in terms of supporting our very top-tier clinician workforce with whatever tools they're most desiring and effective. We pioneered the earlier human scribe program, and then we've also begun to work with a number of different building out and scaling the AI scribe.

We have a very relatively unique hospital system in that we're tertiary and quaternary care. Our clinicians tend to operate very high in their licenses and we tend to see a number of scenarios and diseases and treatment modalities that are, let's just say, rarer and have more complicated terms and terminology and things like that. We've worked with. particularly around how they can branch out of not just, say, internal medicine or like that, but the other areas, especially as it relates to the higher complexity of care categories.

**Client**
Also, could you walk us through why do you guys use Abridge and Ambience instead of just one?

**Expert**
Yeah. We have a multi-vendor approach and I'm going to try to parse what I say in terms of public information. I think as everybody knows, there's a variety of pricing structures that these companies have. One of the core criteria that we have in evaluating any of these is that they're more cost effective than alternative approaches, for example, human scribes, which are much more expensive. One of them is cost.

Another is each of these vendors is taking a different approach as it relates to how they build up their foundational AI models. We don't think that anything has gelled right now. We want to make sure that we're taking advantage of a very dynamic environment. The other thing I can't get into a lot of details about, but there are different operational complexities to go with each. These are not tools that are the easiest things to scale in the sense of you have to get them installed on devices that the clinicians are using in their workflows.

Each vendor takes somewhat different approaches about how they support those users. We also see that as being relatively dynamic. We like to be cutting edge in terms of innovation. We don't see that any of these vendors have clearly pulled ahead of each other yet.

**Client**
Got it. Could you maybe just walk us through the timeline? Which one did you adopt first? Did you evaluate them in a competitive RFP? Which sectors are using each now?

**Expert**
Yeah. We have started out with Ambience. It was a locally developed company that we've been with a little bit longer than Abridge. I'm trying to remember what our public information is about dates of these. We've been with Ambience a little bit longer than Abridge. We did do competitive and even head-to-head with some users who have used both and we've looked at satisfaction with them. We've done a lot of research around other products as well for like, say, Nuance and based on a matrix criteria including price and user satisfaction, feature capabilities.

We're continuing Abridge right now, but we're not ruling out going to another provider if they were to meet the right set of criteria. In terms of rollout, I can't say exactly which products we're using at what percentages across different parts because of our relationship with those two vendors. I can say that we looked at both Ambience and Abridge. I can say that we've identified that they're both capable for a wide degree of spread, particularly amongst our ambulatory physicians. Today, all of our ambulatory physicians are eligible for using an AI scribe. I have to parse because we're talking about a current employer. I have to carefully parse that.

**Client**
Got it. It's our understanding that Ambience is used in more of the specialties, whereas Abridge is used in more of the primary care. Are there significant differences in quality between the two? Are there any product differences that we should be keeping in mind, given you guys did a head-to-head?

**Expert**
If you're thinking about it in terms of spread, we have tertiary and coronary care. Even in our internal medicine, you might see a level of complexity that's higher than at other non-academic. We have not seen, I'd say, sizable differences in the satisfaction of the providers where we've implemented it. I would not say that one is pulling ahead of the other in terms of usability or we get ratings from the physicians about their likelihood to use the note or not, likelihood to continue using the app or not the service, as well as their self-report.

Their ratings, did this save me time? Did it reduce my burden of documentation? Do I get to go home? Am I leaving my shift earlier than I would have if I was not using this? We collect data on all of those things internally and study them quite rigorously. Where we've implemented it, we've seen significant improvement in all of those metrics for both of those products. I can't get into exactly where we spread each within our network but I will say across our network, we do have a high degree of complexity. You can infer from that.

The other thing I would say about Ambience versus Abridge, if you're trying to tease those apart, Ambience has worked from the outset. Their founders have a deeper background in the Silicon Valley AI groups. Some of them were at Google with me back when I was at Google. There's a very strong intention that they have around. Ambience is going to have models that are specific to different specialties. They've been early leader in rolling those out.

I would say in certain areas, we're likely to see that as we continue to spread the companies that are investing in model, specifically AI models that are tailored towards the specialty language. I would say those are going to probably outperform as we go spread. That being said, today, we haven't.

**Client**
I see. Does Abridge not take different models approach? Do they just have one model for everything?

**Expert**
They have a couple of different models. I'm trying to remember the way they pose it, but they don't. They're not as oriented around as much fine-tuning for each specialty, or I would say the degree of fine-tuning that they have per specialty. That being said, I do also lead our program from a strategic point of view around generative AI.

Speaking from a subject matter expert on the generative AI front, I don't think that it is settled within the field, whether the general models are going to supersede fine-tuning. We've seen ChatGPT 4.0 wildly exceed a fine-tuned model from a year and a half ago. It's very much a horse race in terms of where we think they're going to shake out as, really, the general purpose model gets so high performing. Again, the field is quite dynamic.

The strategy that Ambience has is that they're going to fine-tune and other companies, I believe, especially as you go down to other companies like a Nabla or others. They're thinking that the base models are going to get better and better and that strategy won't be as important.

**Client**
You talked about these three dimensions, price, user satisfaction. It sounds like, today, definitively, user satisfaction, it's plus minus, depending who you ask. You've alluded to some of these differences on the capabilities, but can you dig into the different dimensions around capabilities where one player is winning versus the other, and then maybe even beyond that where one player is a different point of view? One dimension of that is Abridge has this point of view that seems to be more general model novelist, certainly more base model, whereas Ambience is taking this point of view of fine-tuning is imperative to differentiate from a capability standpoint.

**Expert**
Yeah. Let me put it a couple of different ways. One, it would be general usability. That's going to be UI/UX. That's practically a commodity now with modern coding tools and whatnot. We're not going to see differentiation on that, assuming that these companies don't just mess up and hire bad designers or product, so that usability aside. Usability from, "I like the quality of this note. It was tailored to my dot phrases. It was structured in the way I like. It has the templates that I like. I can edit those templates," both companies have good offerings in that category, but we've seen Ambience move. Let me just say that they have widened their use cases faster than Abridge for us.

They both have pretty aggressive roadmaps in terms of what they're going to be able to do. For example, Ambience has spread to the pre-charting and the post-visit dictation faster than Abridge has. They spread a little bit more towards some of the customization around, say, dot phrases a little faster than Abridge. They both have most of these things that we want on their roadmaps, particularly if you're looking at the roadmap they have for fiscal year 2026. We've seen Ambience hit some of those faster, and we've been able to spread some of those faster, scale some of those faster.

**Client**
Understood. If you just cut that across one other dimension, which is you talked about that for anybody in core ambulatory care they qualify, who's going to unlock more of the internal providers, whether physicians, people out of the ambulatory space, and/or nurses more quickly?

**Expert**
Can you parse that? I felt like there are two questions there. Who's going to reach a bigger scale eventually?

**Client**
Maybe we start there.

**Expert**
We haven't begun to include nurses, that we have included APP. I can't give you numbers for the industry, but within us, we have more specialty care providers than we have primary minus a little bit that we just acquired two hospitals and if you think of all our affiliates. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but our total ambulatory practice is a shade over 2,000, and we've set all of them as eligible. I wouldn't say that some product would. Sorry, I'm trying to parse it again. If we were to scale with either one, that wouldn't be limited right now.

**Client**
Sorry, it wouldn't be what?

**Expert**
If we were to abandon the approach of having multiple providers, if we were to pick one today, we would still be going to all of those ambulatory providers. It would not be limiting the way. Sorry, I am trying to word it the right way for your question.

**Client**
Good. Just as you think about these personas, who's been more innovative from a product velocity standpoint and is faster to unlock? It sounds like on the specialty side, Ambience might be, given their fine-tuned focus, ahead on there. That's what we've heard from the market. As you think about some of these other personas, nurses being a great example, is anybody ahead there?

**Expert**
We haven't evaluated the nursing side of it. We're in consideration on that phase. I would say the spread to other use cases, the coding aware functionality, for example, from Ambience, the other components of the note in an ambulatory setting that we've seen Ambience implement faster for us than Abridge, I would put Ambience a little ahead of Abridge.

**Client**
Got it. You alluded to this effect of potentially choosing one vendor consolidating. How do you think about that future? Is that the goal or the goal to always be on, to be multi-vendor and have a champion challenger type model?

**Expert**
For us, operationally, I think it's quite clear that it'd be easier to only have one. These are relatively expensive products, so cost will remain a factor. I wouldn't say that we would want to be on a multi-horse strategy for longer than we need to be, but I think it is very dynamic. Operationally, the integrations are not excessively difficult like they're not in the EMR, but they're not without overhead as well, especially as we have our own complicated implementation of Epic have acquired.

**Client**
Can you talk about pricing model and differences? Obviously, that's a huge consideration and you mentioned there are some differences here.

**Expert**
I can't get into the prices that we pay specifically.

**Client**
That's not what we need. Maybe just order, maybe just relatively speaking.

**Expert**
Relatively speaking. These are both quite a bit cheaper than Nuance, obviously, and we're getting relatively competitive prices. I wouldn't stack for that.

**Client**
Got it. It's not like one is between Ambience and Abridge is winning with pricing as a lever.

**Expert**
No, but they're both winning versus Nuance.

**Client**
Do they have the same pricing model for perceived basis per provider?

**Expert**
Broadly, yes.

**Client**
How much did the Epic integration play into your decision? I understand that Abridge is this Epic Workshop company, whereas Epic is opening it up and Ambience has their own integration. Does that matter significantly in your decision?

**Expert**
That component of it, not as much. It comes down to the nitty-gritty of the integration and getting the settings right on our side. It really has more to do with this. The ability to get time from the teams, our integrations, and then the structure team, security and all of that, that's a much bigger deal on our side. I wouldn't say either approach has made it significantly easier for us.

**Client**
Maybe just taking this very big step back because you have such an interesting perspective across AI, the entire system. As you just think of the right starting point and ability to compound value from an AI standpoint within a large system like yours broadly, would you say that that makes sense and this feels to be the most interesting and enduring place to start?

**Expert**
Let me start as a slightly different angle on that. One of the hardest things for any of these, these tools have relatively fast integrations compared to some others. We are not using the offerings from some of the previous round of these, Suki or Augmedix or things like that, who you might have thought would have already been entrants in that they have relationships. We were using Augmedix human scribe program.

It wasn't the sales cycle and it wasn't the integration. It was the competitiveness of the product that we ran with. The spread is non-trivial for these products. If you're the surface that a clinician is used to using, we've seen clinicians move between the different ones relatively easily. Once you're using one for a while, as it starts to do more and more for you, especially around pre-visits, post-visits, we're obviously not into clinical decision-making, but I think everyone's talking about it in the coming years, probably short number of years, that'll be on the table, depending on the FDA goes.

I could see this being a surface that every clinician who's thinking about where they want to be working is going to be expecting a tool like this in the sense of how it really pushes past what we've had that was wrong with the EMR workflow experience for clinicians for 30 years. My wife's an emergency medicine doctor. We talk about this all the time. I would say the ROI right now for us, the key ROI is physician satisfaction. That has ROI in terms of churn and there being the physician shortage, that's going to explode in the coming decade.

The partner that solves that is going to have a core place in any hospital system. The moat is what I wouldn't be able to comment on. Because if the models get way easier and the UI, the models get much more generalizable, as the AI partners are saying, and the UI/UX, all of that's relatively easy and integrations get easier because people can write code with AI bots now. The moat isn't necessarily as much there as you would think it would be because the underlying hard part of this is getting easier and coming monetized, i.e., the model.

I didn't give you a definitive answer there, but I will say that the space in the hospital system, in terms of being one of the biggest band-aids we've seen on the poor workflow created by EMRs, that's enduring. It will not go away that AI assistance are going to solve for the fact that the EMR has made giving patient care very difficult and low empathy and low relationships, given that people were typing instead of having eye contact. I would say it's a very enduring product category probably years to come.

**Client**
Yep. Maybe take that next step. I know it's very hard to understand where the moats are. If you look at the chips on the table today, realizing that there's a lot of uncertainty, what would be your view on how the game plays out? What questions would you be asking these vendors to inform your point of view around who might be the player that captures the most value over in the fullness of time? What would get you excited to hear where you'd say, "Oh, wow, they're thinking about it the right way," or "They have the right compounding and enduring advantage"?

**Expert**
I think any hospital system is going to continue to think of their workforce as their core capability. If they have a method of supporting a physician or clinician, any clinician, really, the degree of spread, if I could say that each one, when I'm talking to them, deeply understands the workflow of the XYZ person they're trying to put their app in front of, that would make me excited.

If they're saying, "Hey, we have a model and for this specialty," and then you ask questions about understanding that workflow and they don't have good answers, that's a red flag. The other thing we didn't talk about was more real time. We very much think of it as this is a tool that's going to assist the physician to write a better note. It's not going to submit the note for them because part of the looking over your note is part of your value add as a thinking person.

These clinicians have spent decades training to allow their working brain to process the text in front of them and add more value. It's not going to do that for them. If it can help them with the menial parts so that they can apply more of what they're uniquely qualified at, that's better. The reason that the workflow is so important, and I'm a product person, is it needs to sit cognitively at the right time points and the right surfaces in that. If it doesn't, and if it tries to alter their workflow too much, you lose the value add of each of those clinicians.

As I would be talking with any of them, I would be saying, from a product point of view, are you trying to change their workflows with this, or are you supercharging their workflows and taking the pain points out of it? My wife is always saying her human scribe goes to the hallway and retrieves stuff for her. None of these are going to do that for her. For people who are making the switch, this needs to supersede some of the things that the human scribe can do in order to make that switch. The way it does that is by aiding them at the frictional parts in their existing workflow.

Forcing changes in workflows is really tough operational and can break things much more quickly because if you change the workflow, you may lose a step you didn't know was actually super high value. That would be where I would like tease in to these. That's not easy. That's harder research with teachers. You could infer that by the variety of places.

If I was looking at a company and I was saying, "Oh, they're at academic medical centers at private hospitals in the South. They're at family practices in the suburbs." If you could see that they were getting good penetration at a variety of places, you might have a better idea that they are more adaptable. A variety of workflows. That'll be a good bellwether.

**Client**
One thing that, depending on the perspective you have, feels a little important is this seems to be an industry where it's insular in the thinking and people want to pick the best vendor. The kind of sentiment we've heard is that Abridge has been ahead with the Epic branding partnership and early access integration. Wondering if you think that narrative is real.

Is there this idea of this compounding advantage from a distribution standpoint even if the products are either the same or maybe even Ambience is a marginally better product, but it's not 5X better or 2X better that Abridge maybe just wins the market with that kind of distribution narrative? Would you say that's not as real as we maybe perceive?

**Expert**
Distribution is incredibly important. Before I was doing this gig at AI a couple years ago, I was product manager in our more skunkworks, a center for digital health innovation. I did the same thing like barely Google X. Anything in the digital health space, which this still continues to sit in, you're thinking, "How do I deliver value in the short, single-digit number of years before Epic rolled out a not very good punk version of this product?" You always have Epic in your rearview mirror and yours needs to supersede it by a lot and builder value in that short term before Epic has a version of it.

The name partnering with Epic goes a massive way because there's tons of people within any health system who would say, "Why do we need this right now? Let's just wait for Epic to turn." That's on everything. We want to do something. That's not just this category. That's literally everything because the complexity of doing anything that's not Epic is operationally and whatever is just much higher. Not saying the new features from Epic are always turnkey.

**Client**
The last question is, what's your take on Epic here competitively? Do you think they come out with a product and compete?

**Expert**
This is a very notable one where they have done two name partners., and that has not been their strategy in the past. I think it's because they recognize that. I don't think Epic is building foundational models. They're taking a, "We're going to solve for all the complexity of all of the models in the world and all the model vendors in the world, Amazon versus Microsoft," approach.

They're trying to become the one who cleans that all up for everybody because it's so dynamic. They are naming partners in this space, and that is novel relative to most things they're doing. Given that they've broke the seal on that, if different companies pull away, I could see them do that on other things that are smaller, more niche. They did the App Orchard approach. I don't think there's going to be a white label.

They didn't white label this from the outset, so they're not saying this is going to be a core functionality of Epic. They're taking a partnering approach. I think that's a huge signal that this is a very dynamic sector that they're not saying, "Hey, just wait, we'll have our own version of this soon." They were like, "No, we need it now and we're going to end up some name partners."

**Client**
This is super helpful. I'm just curious, do you think Ambience has a shot at taking meaningful market share away from Abridge, or is Abridge, do you think, crowned the winner at this point just because of the Halo effect? I'm just curious your personal take.

**Expert**
If I was to speak personally, I would always go back to thinking about, and this is only personally, how Google was always a fast follower. I think it's in my DNA of understanding that right to win and scalability is always important. Google did not always have the best from a personal point of view, we did not always have the best product, but we knew how to scale. That would be how I would answer that question.

**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
