Radically improving care for individuals with SMI is no small feat and requires a bold vision. Stas and Sonia started Amae in part because of their personal lived experience, and when we first met them, we could not think of a better team to build the first integrated value-based care model for SMI patients. Stas and Sonia combine their philosophy of whole-person care for patients with SMI and experience in digital health to leverage novel tools and technology to improve care coordination and close care gaps to bring help to those who need it most.
