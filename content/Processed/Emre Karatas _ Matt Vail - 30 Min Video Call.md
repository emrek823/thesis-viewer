### Matt Vail Background & Journey

- Former Datavant employee (6 years) - joined at 20 people/$2M revenue
	- Led global product, technology and design team of ~500 people
	- Left September 1st after helping grow business to ~$2B revenue
	- Eighth person on engineering team, partnered with founder on growth
- Background: Biomedical engineer, passionate about health/fitness/technology
	- Co-founder experience across three separate occasions
	- College hockey player, follows Peter Attia protocols
	- Clinical research and software engineering experience
- Personal motivation for leaving Datavant
	- Felt less excited about role (personal, not company-related)
	- Still bullish on Datavant’s financial success and biggest cheerleader
	- Wanted to move closer to consumer/patient vs building for downstream stakeholders

### Product Vision: Family Health Concierge Platform

- Core problem identification
	- Patient almost never the customer/buyer in healthcare
	- Creates perverse incentives - “tick tacking around edges vs actually fixing shit”
	- Personal frustration: no good way to get personalized health recommendations for 36-year-old male
	- Healthcare system navigation is “huge pain in the ass” and can become part-time job
- Technical architecture evolution
	- Personal Health Record (PHR) foundation
		- Recognized dozen players tried and failed at PHR-only approach
		- PHR is component of architecture, not standalone company/product
	- Contextual decision-making layer
		- Use aggregated data to provide actionable insights about care
		- Beyond just putting lab tests into ChatGPT
	- Care orchestration layer
		- Don’t just recommend melanoma screening - schedule appointment
		- Find physician who does most screenings within 10 miles
		- Ensure in-network, provide cost estimates
	- Family management for stickiness
		- Add 3-4 family members to account creates switching barriers
		- “You never switch, you never return”
- Product positioning: “Medicine 3.0 concierge for your family”

### Business Model & Partnership Strategy

- Partnership approach prioritizes consumer experience first
	- Can make recommendations/take action for non-partner vendors
	- Flexible system - find Kansas City dermatologist without formal partnership
	- Revenue through affiliate/referral relationships secondary to user value
- Potential partnership categories
	- National labs (Quest, LabCorp) for diagnostics
	- D2C prescription companies (RO, Hims & Hers) for referral revenue
	- Specialist providers and academic hospitals for rare diseases
	- Supplement companies (Thorn) for direct subscription fulfillment
	- Fitness/sleep tracking partners (Whoop, Peloton) for lifestyle optimization
- Current status: Solo founder actively fundraising to bring on team members
- Care pathway example workflow
	- User reports daily headaches for two weeks via chat interface
	- System asks diagnostic questions like provider would
	- Develops personalized care pathway: reduce caffeine, increase hydration, add electrolytes
	- Escalates to sleep tracking recommendation if initial steps don’t work
	- Proactive notifications for family member vaccinations and preventive care
