## Slide 3

The Patient Journey is the golden thread.

The key decisions that drive healthcare outcomes and spend all relate back to individual journeys.

ALBERT is a 63-year-old retired schoolteacher living alone in New Jersey. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes after his last health visit and tests. He also suffers from hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

Who are the right doctors and clinicians for this individual?

Albert’s doctors need to make the right care and utilization decisions to manage his acute and/or chronic journey.

What are this individual’s likely outcomes? What are the best interventions and therapies?

Albert is prescribed new therapeutics. After a few months, his doctor enrolls him in a phase 3 clinical trial for a novel treatment that shows potential in complex patients like Albert.

As Albert’s complex condition is managed and his outcomes improve, his health plan and doctors are bonused based on the value they delivered.

How do I efficiently incentivize and pay for the right physician and patient behaviors?

Albert’s health plan needs to ensure it has the right doctors in network and assign him to a population health program that will deliver the interventions he needs  to manage his diabetes.

Albert needs to be matched to best team to meet his complex needs.

Acclaimed by Frost & Sullivan for the most innovative real-world evidence (RWE) solution in the life sciences industry

The Frost & Sullivan 2021 Real-World Evidence IT Solutions report outlines how Clarify differentiates.
10 patents covering how the platform automates ingesting, cleaning, and enriching of patient-level data
400+ individual-level, de-identified SDoH factors such as race, income, transportation access, housing stability, education level, and health literacy
Demonstrated return on investment (ROI), identifying 60 % more patients with rare heart disease, 33 % more high-value HCPs for an oncology drug, and 7,000 priority patients with a high risk of non-adherence for a hematology brand.
Exceptional customer success team that maximizes the ROI for each customer. Clarify exceeded the SaaS industry benchmark achieving 56.3 net promoter score in its most recent semi-annual survey.

Instead of targeting HCPs simply treating diagnosed patients, Clarify pinpointed eligible patients in need of second-line therapy

By leveraging social determinants of health, Clarify identified likely users living far from infusion CoEs, low income, without transportation

Instead of relying only on ICD-10 codes, Clarify surfaced a meaningful number of “suspected” patients who had been mis-diagnosed

## Slide 20

Impact Stories

---

## Slide 21

$300M revenue potential for hematology infusion therapy identified by large pharma

Inability to quantify real-world treatment patterns with existing assets to assess performance and differentiate
Blind to non-clinical factors which impact care, creating a major risk at the time of launch

Surfaced the first known national characterization of clinical and social profiles in the disease state

CHALLENGE

SOLUTION

IMPACT

14K patients precisely identified, which enabled the marketing and patient support teams to prioritize investments
50% of those patients were likely lack access to treatment based on their access to transportation and proximity to CoEs
$300M in revenue potential by improving launch strategy and access

Precisely identified niche patient populations, including those with non-clinical barriers to care

Visualized patient journeys within high need precision cohorts across social and clinical factors

---

## Slide 22

$20M annual incremental revenue recouped by diagnostics company after identifying higher-value HCPs

25% of testing revenue in their women’s health business was lost at the start of COVID-19
The team lacked visibility into how to target and engage HCPs to regain market share

Identified brand-specific highest potential provider segments

CHALLENGE

SOLUTION

IMPACT

$20M in revenue potential expected by boosting sales and retention rates with more precise HCP targeting and messaging

Accessed nuanced patient cohort insights to inform HCP messaging

Extracted HCP insights into their CRM to enable commercial prioritization

---

## Slide 23

3.8K highest potential investigators identified for osteoarthritis clinical trial

A trial protocol had very narrow inclusion and exclusion (I/E) criteria (focusing on a subset of osteoarthritis patients)
Existing assets could not identify niche patient populations or identify highest potential PIs

Defined precise I/E criteria to identify previously unidentifiable patient cohorts

CHALLENGE

SOLUTION

IMPACT

430K hard-to-find patients identified along with associated HCPs and accounts
3.8K high potential physicians identified from list of 20K candidates, which accelerated site selection

Designed a best fit profile to identify highest opportunity sites and PIs

Leveraged referral network analytics to engage community care networks

## Slide 24

A genetic testing company plans to turn around a 20% revenue loss with better HCP targeting using real-world, patient journey insights

Clarify Segments

.ChallengeA genetic testing company lost a fifth of its revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic. Leadership had to re-think the old approach to provider targeting, which was based on past ordering volume and feedback from the field team. They needed better HCP segmentation and insights into HCP opportunity.

“With Clarify, we have access to insights we’ve never had before. We discovered that we had only been targeting half of our top opportunity providers. I can’t believe we were only calling on a portion of our highest priority customers.”
General Manager, Urology Business Unit, Diagnostic Testing Company
