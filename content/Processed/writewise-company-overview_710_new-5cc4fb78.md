## Slide 2: Health insurance is too expensive in the US. We need alternative health insurance structures

HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED ~40% SINCE 2012, RELATIVE TO ~25% INFLATION

### Average Annual Worker and Employer Premium Contribution for Family Coverage, 2012, 2017, 2022

| Year | Employer Contribution | Worker Contribution | Total Premium | Total Premium Increase (vs. 2012) | Worker Contribution Increase (vs. 2012) |
| :--- | :-------------------- | :------------------ | :------------ | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| 2012 | $11,429               | $4,316              | $15,745       | -                                   | -                                         |
| 2017 | $13,049               | $5,714              | $18,764       | 19%                                 | 32%                                       |
| 2022 | $16,357               | $6,106              | $22,465       | 20%                                 | 7%                                        |

Health benefits are eating into business opex for all businesses

**SOURCE:** KFF EMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFITS SURVEY, 2022; KAISER/HRET SURVEY OF EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFITS, 2012 AND 2017

## Slide 3: These alternative structures, namely self insurance, thus far have been severely constrained

*   **Lack of:** DATA AVAILABILITY FOR SOPHISTICATED UNDERWRITING
*   **Lack of:** TRANSPARENCY AROUND UNIT COSTS
*   **Lack of:** CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN INSURANCE CAPACITY AND DISTRIBUTION
*   **Lack of:** EASE FOR RETAIL BROKERS WHO HAVE TO EDUCATE AND MANAGE EMPLOYER PLAN VS HAVING THE CARRIER DO ALL THE WORK

## Slide 4: Market Forces and Innovation are finally removing constraints

| DATA AND TECHNOLOGY                                                                                                        | REGULATORY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | DISTRIBUTION                                                                                                                                                               | MACROECONOMIC                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Platforms such as Verikai have established that alternative data and AI are a viable surrogate to historical claims data | Transparency in Coverage Final Rule (effective 2023) requires improved health plan transparency re: unit costs. This opens the door for MGAs to get PBM formulary access at wholesale and direct contracts with provider networks, reducing the structural advantages of fully insured carriers | MGAs empowered with tools and access are looking to aggregate the business, but don't have the underwriting or carrier capacity to do so | With reduced access to capital and a potential recessionary environment, many businesses are examining their largest opex line items for savings, and health benefits present a real opportunity |

## Slide 5: Massive addressable market opportunity

### U.S. group health insurance market size

*   **156 million**
    *   156m people in the U.S. (55.4% of population) with employer-based group health insurance.
    *   **SOURCE:** U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, 2021
*   **~ $2.1 trillion**
    *   ~ $2.1 trillion in annual premiums.
    *   **SOURCE:** KAISER FAMILY

### WriteWise OPPORTUNITY: $1.1 trillion of addressable premiums

**U.S. FULLY-INSURED GROUP HEALTH MARKET SIZE:**
Opportunity to transition to self insured chassis

*   **$1.5 trillion**
    *   $1.5 trillion in annual premiums in the U.S.
    *   (i) ~$500 billion to cover the pharmacy portion only.

**U.S. SELF-INSURED GROUP HEALTH MARKET:**

*   **~ $600 billion**

## Slide 6: Our solution: a new risk transfer platform that can reduce health insurance expense by 20%

INFRASTRUCTURE TO FACILITATE TRANSITION FROM FULLY INSURED TO SELF-INSURED CHASSIS

**INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CAPACITY**
*   CONSTANTLY SEEKING NEW AND PROFITABLE PREMIUM

**WriteWise**
*   SYNTHESIZED ALTERNATIVE DATA
*   SOPHISTICATED UNDERWRITING

*   **PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, e.g.**
    *   Level-funded pharmacy insurance (for mid-market and enterprise employers)
    *   Aggregate-only premium structures (for SMEs)
    *   Provider two-sided risk in Medicare Advantage (for IPAs)
    *   Potential future products: dental, vision, workers comp, life, other employer-sponsored benefits

*   **EMBEDDED DISTRIBUTION**
    *   SEEING SIGNIFICANT DEMAND FROM
        *   MGAs
        *   Payroll and PEO platforms
        *   Brokers
        *   Physicians (e.g. as Medicare Advantage sponsors)

## Slide 7: Led by the founding team of Verikai and Radion, we have tremendous founder/market fit and build on many years of direct experience

    *   Deep data science and software experience

## Slide 8: Specialty Drug Cost

*   **75x**
    *   The cost of specialty drugs are 75X higher than brand and generic medications

*   **50%**
    *   Specialty drugs make up 2% of total claims but 50% of pharmacy spend

*   **+30%**
    *   Specialty drugs also have an additional 30% ADDED cost due to drug manufacturer rebates that are never redeemed by the employer

*   **↑**
    *   The cost of drugs to the employer is rising faster than the decrease in medical costs those drugs are supposed to provide which is eating into the employer's total liability

SOLUTION NEEDED TO PROVIDE THESE LIFE ALTERING DRUGS WITHOUT BANKRUPTING THE MEDICAL PLAN

## Slide 9: Product Roadmap (see program decks for detail)

### 2023: Enterprise "Rx Guarantee”
*   Unbundling pharmacy from medical for self-insured customers
*   Secured exclusive initial go-to-market and development partner: Intercept RX, a leading enterprise self-insurance architect
*   WriteWise to provide underwriting, product development, rates, and (re)insurance capacity for stop-loss
*   Intercept to provide initial distribution, TPA, physician networks, claims adjustment
*   Targeting Intercept's mid-market and enterprise clients, acquired via broker channels
*   Supplement Intercept distribution with founders' broker and channel networks (Marsh, Newfront, etc.)
*   Value proposition: 15-20% savings

### 2024: Self-Insured SME/Mid Market
*   Helping SME / mid market businesses transition from fully insured to self insured
*   Prospective initial go-to-market partners have helped construct PEOs for several of the leading HR SaaS / payroll software platforms
*   WriteWise to provide underwriting, product development, rates, and (re)insurance capacity for stop-loss
*   Initial distribution: large HR / payroll providers
*   Supplement distribution with founders' broker and channel networks, as well as other MGAs
*   Value proposition: 15-20% savings

### 2025 and Beyond: Risk Transfer Platform
*   Leverage the WriteWise platform for a broader set of customers where self insured structures achieve cost savings
*   Serve as aggregator of capacity for universe of A&H MGAs
*   Potential areas of expansion: Medicare Advantage, dental, vision, workers comp, group life, specialty benefits

## Slide 10: Price Pharmacy Separately

### PHARMACY FOCUS
Pharmacy claims are adjudicated through a separate system from medical claims allowing cost containment and diversion programs that are pharmacy focused only.

### REBATES
Rebates are managed through the same admin platform where they are aggregated and returned to the premium holder.

### 10-20% SAVINGS
This provides anywhere from 10-20% savings in total medical cost if pharmacy is carved out from the medical plan.

### PROFIT VS. MEDICAL RISK
But today, the FI carrier uses that 10-20% profit for margin purposes and not the medical risk.

## Slide 11: Underwriting Process

1.  **PRODUCER SUBMITS GROUP FOR CARVE OUT**
2.  **RUN UP AGAINST PROPRIETARY PHARMACY ONLY MANUAL**
3.  **VERIKAI SCORING APPLIED TO CREATE TOTAL EXPECTED CLAIMS FROM CHRONIC CONTINUOUS CLINICAL RISK**
4.  **IF CLAIMS PLUS >1.1 THEN PHARMACY CAN'T BE CARVED OUT. IF <1.1 PRICE AT 110% AGGREGATE**
5.  **HV OVERLAY PROVIDED TO ELIMINATE GROUPS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONTINUOUS CONDITIONS THAT ARE <1% PREVALENCE**
6.  **RELEASE QUOTE AND BIND COVERAGE WITHIN 24 HOURS**

## Slide 12: Comparable companies

### WHO WE RESEMBLE:
B2B insurance platforms with high quality revenue, high margins, and attractive valuations, who facilitate profitable insurance for carriers
*   pareto
*   gravie
*   ACCELERANT
*   ROUNDSTONE
*   radion health

### WHO WE DON'T RESEMBLE:
D2C carriers that struggle with CAC, unit economics, and profitable underwriting
*   oscar
*   Bright HealthCare
*   Clover
*   [Red 'X' mark]

## Slide 13: Competitive landscape and differentiation

COMPETITOR CATEGORY AND WHY THEY'RE CONSTRAINED:

### Competitor category: INSURANCE CARRIER SOLUTIONS
*   **Why they're constrained:**
    *   Inability to develop customized products, e.g. for MGAs with unique customer needs
    *   Very limited rate flexibility and limited underwriting capabilities

### Competitor category: Benefits aggregators (e.g. PEOs / MEWAs / Associations)
*   **Why they're constrained:**
    *   Limited ability to understand / underwrite each group
    *   Many groups subsidizing a risky few - creates an opportunity for level funded / self insured options

## Slide 14: High quality business model with sticky, recurring revenue (see model for details)

### RECURRING UNDERWRITING FEES
*   About 10% of premium
*   Comparable company: Accelerant, valued over $2b and ~20x revenue

### RECURRING PHARMA ADMIN FEES
*   Priced PEPM (about $20). Recurring revenue
*   Comparable company: Pareto Health, valued at $2.25b and > 10x revenue (2023, Warburg Pincus)

### INSURANCE INCOME
*   Via captive insurance entity sharing in risk. About 25% of WriteWise revenue at scale
*   Comparable companies: large health insurance carriers like United or Centene, trading at 20-30x earnings (2023)
