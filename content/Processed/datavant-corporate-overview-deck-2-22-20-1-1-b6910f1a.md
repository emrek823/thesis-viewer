## Slide 3: Our Contentions

1.  Data fragmentation is the biggest bottleneck to realizing the power of data and technology in healthcare
2.  Solving it requires a health data network
3.  To build the health data network, you must be ubiquitous, privacy-centric, and neutral

## Slide 4: Data Fragmentation Underlies Every Major Analytical Problem In Healthcare

## Slide 6: Building a Network in Two Steps

**Telephone Network Analogy**
*   **Step 1:** Lay the phone lines (Image of historical phone line construction)
*   **Step 2:** Allow people to call each other (Image of a doctor using a phone)

**Health Data Network**
*   **Step 1:** Ensure all data sources use the Datavant Patient Key (Image of a padlock icon)
*   **Step 2:** Provide linking using the Datavant Patient Key (Image of a link icon)

## Slide 7: How Datavant's Software Works: Step 1

*   **Input Data:**
    *   Travis May
    *   Social Security Number
    *   Date of birth
    *   Address
*   **Output 1 (Hospital Data):** Arrived at hospital on X date with ABC symptoms & XYZ diagnosis
*   **Process:** The input data is transformed into a Datavant Patient Key.
*   **Datavant Patient Key:** Patient 123
*   **Output 2 (Hospital Data):** Arrived at hospital on X date with ABC symptoms & XYZ diagnosis

CONFIDENTIAL 7

## Slide 8: How Datavant's Software Works: Step 2

*   **Input Data:**
    *   Travis May
    *   Social Security Number
    *   Date of birth
    *   Address
*   **Output 1 (Pharmacy Data):** Arrived at pharmacy on X date to pick up DEF prescription
*   **Process:** The input data is transformed into a Datavant Patient Key.
*   **Datavant Patient Key:** Patient 456
*   **Output 2 (Pharmacy Data):** Arrived at pharmacy on X date to pick up DEF prescription

CONFIDENTIAL 8

## Slide 9: How Datavant's Software Works: Step 3

*   **Patient 123** (from hospital data)
    *   Arrived at hospital on X date with ABC symptoms & XYZ diagnosis
*   **Patient 456** (from pharmacy data)
    *   Arrived at pharmacy on X date to pick up DEF prescription
*   **Datavant's Role:** Datavant has a Rosetta Stone that knows Patient 123 and Patient 456 correspond to the same patient.

CONFIDENTIAL 9

## Slide 10: How Datavant's Software Works: Protecting the Process

*   One-way cryptographic hash ensures that Datavant Patient Key cannot be reversed
*   Site-specific encryption ensures that sites retain control over their Datavant Patient Keys and that an incident at one site does not impact the rest of the ecosystem
*   Cryptographic de-identification process has been certified by leading HIPAA experts

CONFIDENTIAL 10

## Slide 11: Life of a Datavant Customer: SHYFT

a Medidata company

**• Problem:**
*   SHYFT offers medication adherence analysis for customers with specialty products
*   Understanding adherence requires connecting specialty pharmacy data

**• Datavant's Solution:**
*   **De-identify:** Sources can only send data to SHYFT in de-identified form
*   **Link:** SHYFT wants to understand which patients switch pharmacies (v. drop out), so Datavant tokenizes the de-identified source records so they are linkable

**Diagram Flow:**
1.  Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy, McKesson Specialty Pharmacy, and Accredo Specialty Pharmacy **De-identify and connect with Datavant**.
2.  The de-identified data flows to **SHYFT** (a Medidata company).
3.  Result: Improved medication adherence tracking.

## Slide 12: The Flywheel: Generating a Network Effect Between Sources & Users

**Work with data users to identify additional sources until we become an integral part of their core business**

**Diagram:**
*   **Thousands of analytics companies servicing...**
    *   Life Sciences
    *   Providers
    *   Payers
*   **Connectivity** (Datavant logo)
*   **Thousands of data sources and aggregators, including...**

    *   Medical claims
    *   Retail pharmacy
    *   Specialty pharmacy
    *   Diagnostic labs
    *   Genetic tests
    *   Devices & wearables

**Work with data sources to identify data users with use cases that require their data**

## Slide 28: Competition

*   Historically, companies offering similar capabilities focus on building **vertically-integrated data and analytics companies**
    *   IQVIA: ~$28B market cap
*   Connectivity has always been a means to an end – never the end itself
*   As a result, no one has won the connectivity market end-to-end (or built the products and architecture necessary to do so)

**IQVIA Diagram Elements:**
*   **Thousands of analytics companies servicing...**
    *   Providers
    *   Payers
    *   Life Sciences
*   **Connectivity** (Datavant logo shown as separate)
*   **Thousands of data sources and aggregators, including . . .**
    *   EHR
    *   Wearables
    *   Labs
    *   Claims

*Note: The IQVIA diagram shows a vertical integration model where IQVIA itself connects to providers, payers, life sciences (as analytics companies) and also directly to EHR, wearables, labs, and claims as data sources, indicating a more all-encompassing, single-provider approach to both data and analytics.*
