Q4 - We have 2 contracts going through approval/end stages valued at a total of $500k+ (ΕΟΥ ~$2M+)

*   We've spent a lot of Q3->Q4 removing customers that we felt weren't strong enough for scale. Typically, they were all small contracts (<65k). (Unable to expand, high cost support, etc)

### Metrics

12 accounts as of November 30, 2025

**Update cash on hand accounts**
**Add accounts receivable Accrual**

We are growing faster than many of our peers. It's now time to create a large delta between us & the rest. We have a strong chance to build something very big.

## Page 2: Overview -

### Overview -

We formed Dart (Puzzl INC) on October 8th, 2021. It's now been 4+ years since we decided to build. A majority of that time was spent building things that didn't work. We're excited to spend the next decade building things that change the world.

To deliver care, there are several steps that rely on people. Humans to deliver care, humans to stitch together human interactions, humans to fill cracks in the system, etc. The problem isn't humans, it's the capacity they have.

Healthcare data (multimodal, scattered, unstructured, etc) makes problem solving difficult & humans a necessity.

### Workflow Overview -

Typically, a healthcare leader will notice or check in on certain trends (readmissions, patient satisfaction, provider quality, etc). This is usually done by requesting data from BI.
Then, they'll review real data & do a lookback. They'll review clinical notes, staffing, outcomes, surveys, timelines, etc. This is done within an EMR + survey + schedules + claims, etc.
Finally, they'll generate a plan. They'll ask team members to do a better job checking for X, confirming Y, or similar. Currently, we help with the execution portion. We build workflows that autonomously check & conduct actions where there is currently a problem. We're expanding to the rest of the flow. All we need to do is capture value & reduce costs at each step.

### Why are LLMs great for healthcare?

*   Healthcare work is nearly all rote memorization & decision trees at a very high scale.
*   Healthcare is the most labor intensive market in the world, an oil rig & an OR take the same amount of humans.
*   It's also almost perfectly universal in its operations.
*   LLMs are already priced at 50% savings compared to humans.

But, it takes a lot of work to have a stable deployment - especially for critical areas of business. We're building the freeways, sidewalks, police stations, everything else to make AI work for patients.

There will be a material difference in care outcomes between a hospital that has AI working vs one that doesn't. It will be near malpractice not to deploy the most intelligent technological innovation across the spectrum of the industry.

### Product -

As a technology startup building for healthcare, we have 1 main goal – materially extend the frontiers of generative AI to healthcare.

We are building out 2 core systems to do this -

## Page 3: Workflows & Customers

1.  **Workflows**
    a. These are harnesses for models to work in chains, single tasks, in parallel, etc. They usually do something like this - 1. Review 2. Answer 3. Action. These are high volume, background running tasks, and take <10% of humans time to maintain/use.
2.  **Assistants**
    a. Assistants are usually user-facing & have high human interaction. They are built for tasks where the next step is dependent on a variance of things that humans must decide (business decisions, care decisions, etc) & have much lower volume.

In between these systems we have evals, performance monitoring, human in the loop, git, rules, ontology, etc built in house. Models will continue to get smarter & smarter. We find areas of business that were previously unfriendly to AI to quickly be a strong fit. So, we'll need to be the first in line to tackle these. We're faster & more likely to win by owning the stack. Since 2014, every single F1 championship has been won by a "Works" team (those who verticalize their development) vs those that heavily rely on others.

### What else are we working on -

1.  The AI Deployment Strategist
2.  Consensus-based Tasks
3.  Long Running Tasks/Deep Research
4.  AI Data Analyst

Over time, we'll be able to go from idea → production use case in <30 days across any spectrum of service lines/departments.

### Customers -

Learning through more than a dozen deployments, the quality of the customer is extremely important during this stage.

We split quality up in 3 ways -

1.  **Contract Size** - Are they going to pay enough today & can they pay more in the future?
2.  **Repeatability** - Is there a large market of customers that have the same needs?
3.  **Logo** - Will they help us grow our brand & trust?

We're working with amazing folks like Choice TX (highly recognizable in home health & hospice), HPH (enterprise Rehab system), etc.

\*CHAP (the largest accreditation body in Home Care (home health, hospice, Primary Care @ Home, etc). They currently accredit 5000+ home health & hospice agencies in the country & will be using DART to help conduct their survey audits. Their brand will allow us to close more deals faster (and start growing inbound), since home health & hospices use DART's AI QA solution to stay (CHAP) survey ready.

## Page 5: Expansion, Team, Fundraising

### Expansion -

We are now building the muscle to land & expand. The majority of our customers have now asked for more than their initial use case (the ask comes <120 days of initial contracting). These can be priced anywhere from 10-100% of their current contracts & should cost us much less to deploy.

General areas that we've been tasked to look at so far -

1.  Hospitalization Risk
2.  H&P Review
3.  HH -> Hospice Transfer
4.  Data Analysis

### Team -

We're building a team that can deliver outsized value in healthcare, fast.

**Veeraj (Co-Founder)** - Built out pharmacy & rehab workflows, utilized GPT-3.5, and sold first co in high school. Declined college.
**Aakruti (Co-Founder)** - Closed enterprise/gov customers for UCBerkeley Consulting club, early stage AI Insurance co, and sold first co. Dropped out of Haas.
**Shilpa (APE)** - Rescinded med school acceptance, worked for DeepScribe (early stage), UCSF, and Verily.
**Jackson (APE)** - MD declined residency, build cataract chatbot with GPT-3, and spent time in late stage health tech
**Kelly (Sales)** - 2 decades of experience in post acute sales, book of business including the top 100 home health & hospice agencies by revenue. Well known as a top 5 sales leader in the entire space.
**Brazil (BZ)**
**Marcelo (BZ)** - 10+ years as an engineer working with early stage founders & LLMs.
**Gustavo (BZ)** - In one of his earliest roles, as a junior engineer, he was tasked with building an AI chat that Whatsapp messaged those who had outstanding balances for retailers. He built & scaled the product to support 1M/daily messages, over $10M in recoveries in 3 months, and $100M over just 2 years.
**+ 3 (BZ) Junior - Senior Eng**

Building this BZ team out has been massive for product velocity while everyone else tries to chase mid-tier engineers that are getting "recruited by OAI" or are ex-Amazon PMs.

### Fundraising

We have raised an aggregate of $2.6M. We have $2M+ in the bank. We do have plans to become more aggressive in some of our strategies (ex. hiring earlier) but with strong growth we don't burn forcing a fundraise.

## Page 6: 2026 Plans & Metrics

Although, we do need to think about our path to 100M ARR. What will that require? How early can we execute on that goal?

For this, we do believe a fundraise may be required. Since 2023, lots of AI startups have raised $Ms. But, we do see the Great Consolidation coming in 2026-2027. It offers us the opportunity to acquire teams & technology that would take years to build. These are early thoughts.

### 2026 Plans: Getting to $10M+ ARR & setting up to scale past $100M ARR

### Questions to answer by EOY 2026

1.  What does the best team in healthcare look like? Is that us?
2.  Are tier 1 healthcare organizations (recognizable logos) contracting with us?
3.  Why is DART selected over X (vendor/in-house build)?
4.  Can we scale to $100M+ ARR in the next <24 months?
5.  Where are we in terms of PMF?
6.  Are customers happy & raving about us?
7.  Are we delivering outsized value?
8.  Do we have a repeatable sales motion?

### Steps we're taking to answer these -

### Metrics

**Reach $10M ARR by EOY 2026:**
Post Acute business line reaches $5M+ ARR.
a. We're moving upmarket, serving enterprises only. This will grow ACV with a goal of $250k, and 15-20 new customers.
b. We'll be selling a wider variety of specific solutions (not 1 but 3 or 4). This allows us to wedge in with a use case that feels like an asymmetric risk. Then, we upsell heavily.
c. We've recruited a top tier sales executive to tackle this. She's already called up $2M+ customers in her first 48 hours. We're moving into the mid stages with them already.

We will bring on ~15 hospitals this year at an $300K/yr initial ACV.
d. Serving them with the AI data analyst product as a wedge
e. Highlighting key areas where our workflows/assistants can help
f. Building a repeatable sales motion & then expanding the hospital sales team extensively.
g. Expanding use cases (NRR) within the year (+20-50% in ACV)

## Page 7: New Hires, Brand, Challenges

### New Hires

To ensure we can scale, the business needs to continue to move at a fast pace across each department. Veeraj & Aakruti are still heavily dependent on many portions of the business. This can make the engine too hot & lose the speed we have. Here's who we need to change this:

**Head of Commercial**: Managed growth from $XM - $XXXM Healthcare specific
Experience: 10+ years
Focus: Build out A+ brand, customers, and team.

**Head of Engineering**: Prev engineering manager/principal engineer @ tier 1/2 co's (DoorDash, Meta, Google, Palantir, Capital One, etc) Experience: 7-9 years
Focus: Build out robust infrastructure for scale, manage/hire tier 1 technical team

**Head of Delivery**: Slightly technical + managerial + industry-aware. (ex. Management Consultant for Hospitals at large consulting firm) Experience: 6-8 years
Focus: Ensure success, fast. Marketing. Recruiting APEs (deployment). NRR.

We're putting together our "dream team" for reference & will share example profiles.

By 2026 EOY, we'll be 10-15 in NYC :)

### Brand

We've got away with our stealth / product led approach so far. We still believe in it but combining it with a killer team & customer logo set will make us the undeniable kings.

Our brand is be made up of (in order)
1.  Customers
2.  Team
3.  Investors

### 2026 Challenges

Building layers of differentiation.

1.  It's easy to have good investors/cash. It's harder to copy products. It's near impossible to copy the best team.
2.  Thinking long term, we also need to build a cost moat. We're in this for the long term & by having the efficiency in place to out execute the market in R&D, recruiting, etc. we will be able to monopolize the market.
3.  Lastly, we will build a context moat. Most of the clinical <> operation rules aren't written anywhere. (We know this because we pull teeth & nail from clinicians & leaders to get context.) When we help 1 customer, the second customer sees the benefits. It's a simple reason you see products that require little context

## Page 8: Conclusion

If we put together the best healthcare team, it'll become easy for anyone to trust us.
If we build the best context layer, it'll allow us to own the market.
