### Revenue Model & Metrics

- Scripts per provider metrics challenging to measure for pharma attribution
- Fill rates directly impact payment model:
	- Target: 90% fill rate through Squad system
	- Payment based on % improvement from pre-Squad baseline
	- Pricing tied to annualized WAC based on drug costs
- Current fill rate variance by specialty:
	- OAB: Below 50% (confirmed by pharma companies)
	- Oncology: ~75% (higher due to in-house filling)
- Script volume patterns:
	- Urology: 10-20 scripts weekly per provider
	- GI: Significantly higher volume
		- IBD specialists: 100+ scripts weekly
		- Advanced endoscopists: Lower volume due to focus

### Prior Authorization & Renewals

- PA duration varies by payer (6 months to 1 year)
- Product capabilities:
	- Track PA expiration dates
	- Automated renewal applications
	- Mixed requirements for new scripts vs. renewals
- Revenue opportunity through higher refill rates
- Building first adherence features
- Current adherence rates sub-60% for OAB medications

### Provider Strategy & Stickiness

- North Star promise: Driving fill rates for patients
- Building deeper workflow integration:
	- Prior auth is entry point
	- Financial assistance integration
	- Delivery time optimization
	- Adherence tracking
- Real market feedback:
	- Case study: Large prescriber group frustrated with competitor (Tandem)
	- Issue: Big box pharmacy delays vs. local courier service
	- Opportunity: Local pharmacy relationships

### Pharma Market Approach

Specialty-specific strategies:

- GI/IBD:
	- Additional testing requirements
	- Patient-prescriber follow-up critical
	- Formulary competition (e.g., Dupixent vs. Humira)
- Urology:
	- Focus on PA submission rates
	- Currently at 50% baseline
	- Quick traction potential
- Oncology:
	- Comprehensive solution required
	- Financial assistance critical
	- Must excel across all service areas

### Investment Discussion

- Follow-on investment capabilities:
	- Check sizes: $500K to $2M
	- Current round considerations:
	- Potential for larger check ($1.5M-$2M)
	- Lead/co-lead position possible
	- Final decision pending Monday

### Competitive Landscape

- Pharmacy hub utilization at 10%
- Multiple pharma teams using fragmented solutions
- Opportunity in specialty focus areas:
	- Neurology potential
	- Rheumatology consideration
	- Oncology strategy
- Market differentiation through pharma sophistication
