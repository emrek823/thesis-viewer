What does the sales process look like actually today? How much time / energy is required from LightSpun?

Payer

What are lessons in the sales process over the last 6-12 months? Who has been moving slower/faster? Why?

What is required (product, BD, ROI from early customers) to sign 7-figure claims adjudication contract? Could you satisfy Guardian if they signed a CAA contract today?

FDB - lessons learned in sales / deployment? How does that translate to closing next 2-3?

Need to know what is what – what is current/EOY ARR/CARR?

ARR/CARR relationship - nice catch up over last 3 months but how should we expect this relationship to evolve?

Prior learnings re Ameritas, APL, etc. What did we learn here that can be applied to current/future opportunities?

Why prioritize DSOs?
