## Slide 6: ECM Program Update

*   **Increased conversion volume from February** - This month, we adjusted our population of focus (POF) from the homeless population to individuals with high emergency department (ED) utilization rates. The previous challenge of many individuals lacking addresses and phone numbers was mitigated, resulting in an enhanced conversion from 7% to 13.5%.

*   **Optimized Outreach** - We refined our outreach strategy to leverage low-touch, low-cost outreach channels on the front end of the month, allocating higher-cost, high-touch outreach channels for patients who remain unengaged at the end of the month. This optimization led to more cost-effective outreach to our patient base.

*   **Higher Reach Rate** - With the optimized outreach methods and new POF, we were able to engage a higher percentage of members provided in the outreach list, reaching 58.5% of our list and 14% of outreaches resulting in a response.

*   **Enhanced community engagement strategy through key strategic partnerships** - Alliance has proposed facilitating targeted introductions to 5-10 essential community partners, according to our preferences, in order to facilitate warm hand off of ECM eligible patients to Zócalo Health staff.
