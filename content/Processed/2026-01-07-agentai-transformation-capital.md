Outpatient provider groups traditionally outsource RCM workflows to manual billing services companies that use human labor to complete repetitive and complex workflows that result in meaningful lost revenue and payment delays for providers.

AgentAI is an AI-enabled, multi-specialty, end-to-end RCM platform with a flexible pricing model and modular product built to fit unique operational needs. Their platform replaces manual, document-heavy workflows across intake, coding, posting, denials, and accounts receivable (A/R). By unifying data and standardizing processes, teams can work more efficiently, maintain compliance, and build scalable, audit-ready operations.
