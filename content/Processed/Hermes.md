### Fundraising Pipeline Update

- Portfolio companies in motion: Maverick, Quiet, Gradient
- Upfront meetings scheduled for later
- Running sheet being kept live - extremely helpful for tracking fast-moving deals

### Term Sheet Timing Strategy

- Consistent investor question: “What is my timing?”
- Response framework developed:
	- Have term sheet, working with fund on exact timing
	- Running process over next 1-2 weeks to gauge interest
	- Looking for right partner, not rushing for wrong fit
	- Want indication of interest or next steps this week
- Avoid saying “haven’t talked to many people” - implies limited interest
- Position as selective rather than desperate

### Investor Outreach Dynamics

- George from Running Street example:
	- Sent blurb, indicated “hint of urgency, nothing wild”
	- Chat Friday/Monday acceptable, not emergency timeline
- Mo from Sunflower response:
	- Initially neutral (close with Allie, felt bypassed on previous deal)
	- Tune changed positively after speaking with company
	- Weekend availability shows high interest level

### Next Steps

- Talk to Sean about aligning on 6-8 more intros
	- Current pipeline: Tao, City Light, Light Bank, Field, Grahapo, TMB
- Talk to Mo, provide feedback on positive momentum
- Continue positioning as having options while remaining selective
