### Company Background & Leadership

- Anirudh (Ani): Forbes 30 under 30 entrepreneur
	- Built ambient AI at Kamyar used by 1% of physicians nationwide
	- Previously worked at Levels
	- Expertise in building products 0-1 and scaling to hundreds of millions
- Sriram (Sri): Long-term industry veteran
	- Helped build Tesla’s small X
	- Extensive automotive space experience
	- Led enterprise initiatives
- Combined experience: 0-1 company building and scaling to $100M+ revenue

### Core Product & Market Problem

- Healthcare patient retention crisis: 25-30% no-show rates across specialties
	- Some specialties (radiology) hit 50-60% no-show rates
	- Pet CT scan no-shows cost providers ~$3,000 each
- Current tools focus on 75% who show up (denials, documentation, scribes)
- Floe targets the 25% who don’t show up - unlocking net new revenue growth lever
- AI engine predicts missed appointments before they happen
	- Uses clinical and behavioral factors (parking availability, patient tone, historical patterns, service type, referring source)
	- Provides probability classification for each appointment
	- Triggers customized AI actions: outbound calls, texts, emails, EPIC referrals

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Target: Mid-market to enterprise (100+ provider organizations)
- Revenue attribution model: Every flagged high-risk appointment that converts = direct revenue attribution
- ROI calculation: Takes just 1 patient per month per provider to pay for itself
- Example workflow:
	- Patient schedules appointment
	- Model flags high no-show probability
	- Surface alert to provider team
	- Deploy AI actions (calls, texts, intake reminders)
	- Track conversion from scheduled to completed

### Current Status & Traction

- Advisors: Former AI Officer of Kaiser, Chief Medical Officer of Veterans Affairs
- Pipeline: Kaiser and Veterans Affairs pilots expected early next year
- Revenue: Incoming contracts, moving toward deployment and invoicing
- Team: Product built and ready for mid-market deployment
- Strategic timing: Avoiding pilot purgatory by waiting for optimal deployment conditions

### Next Steps

- Emre to review materials by end of week
- If aligned: Second 60-minute call with 5-10 prepared questions
- Decision timeline: 7-14 days post second meeting
- Fundraising: $1.2M round to reach deployment and revenue milestones
- Strategy: Minimize dilution given incoming contracts and near-term revenue visibility
