# Fact Sheet - 2019 Part C and D Star Ratings

**Note:** The information included in this Fact Sheet is based on the 2019 Star Ratings published on Medicare Plan Finder (MPF) on October 10, 2018 (and updated on November 15, 2018). For details on the Medicare Advantage (MA) and Part D Star Ratings, please refer to the 2019 MA Part C & D Star Ratings Technical Notes available at [http://go.cms.gov/partcanddstarratings](http://go.cms.gov/partcanddstarratings).

## Introduction

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) publishes the Part C and D Star Ratings each year to measure the quality of and reflect the experiences of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) and Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs or Part D plans) and assist beneficiaries in finding the best plan for them. The Star Ratings support CMS's efforts to put the patient first in all of our programs. As part of this effort, patients should be empowered to work with their health care providers to make health care decisions that are best for them. An important component of this effort is to provide Medicare beneficiaries and their family members with meaningful information about quality and cost to assist them in being active health care consumers.

## Highlights of Contract Performance in 2019 Star Ratings¹

Medicare Advantage with prescription drug coverage (MA-PD) contracts are rated on up to 46 unique quality and performance measures; MA-only contracts (without prescription drug coverage) are rated on up to 34 measures; and stand-alone PDP contracts are rated on up to 14 measures. Each year, CMS conducts a comprehensive review of the measures that make up the Star Ratings, considering the reliability of the measures, clinical recommendations, feedback received from stakeholders, and data issues. For the 2019 Star Ratings, we introduced two new measures, Statin Therapy for Patients with Cardiovascular Diseases (Part C) and Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes (Part D); transitioned the Beneficiary Access and Performance Problems measure to the display page; implemented scaled reductions for data completeness issues identified for the Part C and D appeals measures; and implemented a new policy to adjust the Star Ratings for contracts affected by major disasters.

## Rating Distribution

The last row in Table 1 details the trend in the average overall Star Ratings weighted by enrollment for MA contracts offering prescription drug coverage (MA-PDs) for the period of 2016 to 2019.

*   Approximately 46 percent of MA-PDs (172 contracts) that will be offered in 2019 earned 4 stars or higher for their 2019 overall rating.
*   Weighted by enrollment, a little over 75 percent of MA-PD enrollees are currently in contracts that will have 4 or more stars in 2019.

## Consistently Low Performers

There are two contracts identified on the MPF with the Low Performing Icon (LPI) for consistently low quality ratings as detailed in Table 6. These contracts are receiving the LPI for Part C and/or Part D summary ratings of 2.5 or fewer stars from 2017 through 2019.

## Table 6: 2019 Contracts with a Low Performing Icon (LPI)

| Contract | Contract Name | Parent Organization | Reason for LPI | Enrolled 10/2018 | SNP |
|:---------|:--------------|:--------------------|:---------------|-----------------:|:----|

## Geographic Variation

The following eight maps illustrate the average Star Ratings weighted by enrollment per county for MA-PDs and PDPs across the U.S., including territories, between 2016 and 2019.³ These maps exclude the employer group health plans. Counties shaded in green indicate that the enrollment-weighted mean for the overall Star Rating in the county for MA-PDs or Part D Rating for PDPs is 4 or more stars. Similarly, counties shaded in yellow indicate that the mean rating is 3 stars, and areas shaded in orange indicate that the mean rating is less than 3 stars. Areas in gray indicate data are not available for those counties. Among the changes and updates from previous years are:

*   Highly rated MA-PDs continue to be available in the vast majority of regions across the country.
*   In the period from 2016 through 2019, the number of highly-rated PDPs across the country generally increased (as evident by the greater percentage of green shaded regions on the maps over time); although in 2019, there was a downward shift in the mean rating in some counties (as evidenced by the greater percentage of yellow shaded regions). Please note that the data are not fully comparable from one year to the next as measures are added and removed from the program.
