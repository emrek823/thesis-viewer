IPO Precedent Analysis: Insurers

Implied valuations for insurance-based physician enablement IPOs

4

In the following chart, we provide relevant financials and valuation multiples for the IPOs of ALHC, OSCR, and BHG
There has been a very wide range of valuation multiples for these companies:
We estimate an average EV/Member of over ~$21K, though this varied from a low of $11.1K (Oscar) to a high of $36.5K (ALHC). This makes sense, as Oscar is oriented around the ACA exchanges, whereas Alignment is MA-centric
The average EV/Revenue multiple has been 6.96x, with a very wide range of 3.10x (Alignment) to 12.63x (Oscar)
EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples are not very meaningful given that these companies are unprofitable at the EBITDA/EBIT lines
Important: These transactions were in March-June 2021 la-la land

## Slide 5

IPO Precedent Analysis: Tech-Enablers

Implied valuations for tech-enablers

5

In the following chart, we provide relevant financials and valuation multiples for the IPOs of Agilon and Privia
Valuation multiples differed wildly for both companies, likely owing to membership mix:
We estimate that Agilon went public at an implied EV/Member of $55K based on year-end 2020 MA membership of 131K (entirely MA). However, the company’s EV/Member valuation was approximately $34K based on projected membership for Jan 2022. On an EV/Physician basis, Agilon went public at an implied valuation of almost $6.1 million per implemented PCP
Privia went public at an implied EV/Member of $3.5K, reflecting the company’s membership mix (~61% commercial) and lower VBC exposure (FFS arrangements accounted for 89.7% of practice collections in 2020). On an EV/Physician basis, Privia  went public at $949K per implemented physician
On average, the two companies went public at a multiple of 4.5x EV/LTM Revenue, with Agilon (5.93x) higher than Privia (3.08x)
EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples are not particularly meaningful given the modest profitability of both companies on a LTM basis
Similarly, went public in la-la land times

## Slide 7

Valuation: Comparables EV/Member

Caveat: Not all members are valued the same in each model

#1: The lack of minimum MLRs allows for much higher margins

#2: The lack of statutory capital allows for much higher returns

## Slide 8

Valuation: Comparables EV/Member

8

We use “Equivalent MA lives” as a metric
1 MA member = 1.00
1 REACH member = 0.75
1 Medicaid member = 0.50
1 Commercial member = 0.40
Oak Street is the outlier for MANY reasons
Concerns at CANO
Level of risk taken
Standardization of model, and capacity 
History, management, and other qualitative factors
Alignment is the insurance outlier, and appropriately so
Tech Enablers: 
agilon benefits from ALL MA, ALL Full Risk
TOI reports silly membership totals
Even adjusting for MA Equivalents doesn’t solve all the issues – and really isn’t a major swing factor for most

EV/Member is a solid metric, but ignores growth rates and capital positions

## Slide 9

Valuation: Comparables EV/Target Margin

What is the value of the existing book of business?

9

There is some semblance of reasonableness with this metric
Market needs to think about “opportunity” when none of the companies are at target margins
Market buys into higher margins at the Tech Enablers
