A: The Pharm Department owns and pays for the product, so it's not in our cost center.

## Client
Hi. We will be discussing the revenue cycle management space, with companies like Latent Health. Let's start with your background.

## Expert
Sure. My role at Northwestern has been focused in the technology space. I'm a pharmacist by background, probably going on about 14 years now. Mostly focused on the technology space, so starting off with Epic EMR and then everything goes from there. At Northwestern, now my role is mostly an advisor role and also an analyst and architect for our healthcare IT software, heavily focused on the Epic EMR, but also accessory software. Latent Health fall into that basket for us.

## Client
Got it. Pharmacy, obviously, covers a lot of different care settings, acute, specialty, infusion. How do you guys split up both the relative size of each of those care settings and the importance for you all from revenue, profit generation standpoint?

## Expert
No question that specialty pharmacy is the leader category. I'm saying this as an analyst, I'm not a VP or somebody that deals in the financials, but just from experience I know that specialty pharmacy at Northwestern probably generates second most amount of revenue outside of the oncology program and the ortho programs. Specialty pharmacy is a very high visibility area in our system of hospitals actually.

Now, we have like 14 hospitals and a few hundred clinics throughout, expanding these care areas to other states, other countries. Specialty pharmacy gets all of our attention. That's where our Latent Health use is right now. Specialty pharmacy is also my main customer for the most part. I do deal on the inpatient side and outpatient side, but specialty is getting most of my attention right now. That's where all the money is.

## Client
Do you categorize infusion within specialty or is that separate?

## Expert
That's a separate program. Specialty pharmacy is an outpatient-only program. Meaning, that's when you've already visited your physicians and now you have medications that are being prescribed for you that you have to pick up, take it home, and typically, are very high-cost medications that require complex care and payment. more or less. Also, dealing with the costs and coverages is a big thing of what the department does and what I have to do.

## Client
Yeah. How did you guys originally get connected to Latent?

## Expert
We have some of our teams and probably middle management goes on the lookout for productivity improvements anytime fiscal year goes past. We have an entire department dedicated to prior auth. We have a lot of people sitting in the office. Picture a call center. It's what we're dealing with here. Specialty pharmacy, we've got dozens of people in different call centers handling intake, output, counseling. Latent Health made themselves visible, I believe, through one of our directors. He was reading stuff about them. We're looking for a way to improve productivity in that area.

Currently, we're using [it] for that and still, to a degree, utilizing a custom product, more manually focused, CoverMyMeds. I think that's going to be phased out. It was brought up just through the grapevine, going

through conferences and seeing what other organizations do to keep in touch with some of our peer organizations that we consider, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins. We are talking and seeing what everyone else is doing and how it's working out for them and sharing that information amongst our peers.

## Client
Got it. Just to clarify one thing. You mentioned you're going to be phasing out CoverMyMeds. Is that because you feel Latent can do that role for you?

## Expert
That's the goal. We definitely don't want two pieces of software that can do the same thing. Here's the deal with Latent, they also have 340B functionality. We're not even utilizing it to right now. It's been less than six months. So far, things are okay. That being said, there's always other products out there too. The organization never stops looking for stuff. We have been using Latent now, it doesn't mean we're not looking at other solutions.

## Client
Yeah. What was the problem you were trying to solve with CoverMyMeds? What's the full scope that you think Latent can sell for you?

## Expert
Full scope is that it's automating our network. We are going to focus productivity and put those human resources towards other jobs that can't so easily be done through automation. That's the main focus right now. Right now, it's not a money thing for us, from my understand. It's productivity-related and we like to put our resources to use elsewhere.

CoverMyMeds requires the users to log into the portal and flipping around and it's like a web-based program, so as technology improves, whatever we can automate, we're going to do that. That includes robots running medications around the hospital. We have robots creating IV medication for us. I think automation robotics is going to play a big part in where these academic centers are going in the next decade.

## Client
Makes a lot of sense. Revenue cycle management, and I'm sure a lot of the work that the technicians are doing in your call center, covers a lot of different pieces in the RCM journey. You have the patient intake, you have benefit verification, estimating out-of-pocket costs, prior auths, potentially onboarding the patient into some financial assistance program. What is the scope that Latent is currently doing? Where do you see this going over time? What is the full scope that you're looking to automate?

## Expert
The full scope at this time is when we're getting rejection for prior auths. Latent Health is able to use its language model and read through the charts and any relevant data to scrape whatever is needed to send back and get that claim approved, so automating what we're doing, and importantly, it is integrated into our EMR, Epic Willow, Hyperspace. That's the main thing with these. They have to be easy to use and integrated in Epic. The automation aspect attracted to us.

Now that these products are coming out, Epic Corporation is furiously trying to release their own. We'll see how that goes if nothing comes out. Latent was the first to market for this type of product. Now, their founder made himself pretty readily available to not just senior leadership but he was on calls with us, so see the face of the owner of the company is there. So far, we've been having a good experience with it, but we'll see how that goes for the next six months or so.

## Client
Yeah. It sounds like the focus is primarily on claims denials and potentially appeals. Is that right?

Correct.

## Client
Got it. It sounds like you all met with a few other folks prior to making the decision to work with Latent. Who are the other folks that you guys evaluated?

## Expert
As far as I know, there really wasn't too much of an exploration here because the budget at these hospitals, especially when it comes to specialty pharmacy, they seem to get whatever they want. We throw stuff at the wall all the time, see if it sticks. I think it was more of, "Let's get this done. We have this possible solution. They gave us a three-month runway to install, so plug it in and if it doesn't work, we'll move on." As far as the other competitive companies, not too sure which ones they may have looked at. I don't think there was much of a look. I think this was just, "Hey, this looks pretty cool. Let's give it a go."

## Client
Are you still in the pilot phase with Latent, it sounds like, for a few months.

## Expert
Correct. The go-live was, I want to say, four months ago. You definitely still call that a pilot phase because you don't have a guaranteed contract with them, I don't think, long term. Again, Epic Corporation is looking to release their own version of this, that's built in. Obviously, the organization does like to keep it simple. So far, it's been pretty good integration-wise. The most important thing is how well does it work with our EMR, in Epic? That's the next big thing.

I think Epic is here and it has been around for a long time. They're releasing their app store, and now you have developers coming out. You have third-party developers now developing for Epic, which has a very prehistoric coding language. That's going to be the next big thing, who can get in and accomplish these things. We don't necessarily always want to use an Epic product, but I think the size of the deal that we have with them makes sense from a cost perspective and usage perspective.

## Client
Yeah. Just to clarify, are you saying that you're going to use Epic's version of what Latent's offering or just the integration of Latent to Epic?

## Expert
Let me clarify that statement. What Latent Health is doing, you have a bunch of other people that are trying to do the same thing. Of course, you have Epic creating their own LLM to do this exact thing. I've seen it and it's still very, very early stage, but you still have the big company coming to see if they can take a piece of this. That's what I meant by that.

## Client
Do you have a sense of what the scope is on the functionality that Epic is looking to build?

## Expert
Yeah. More or less, they're utilizing these large language models to scrape their own software to deliver the solutions that these third-party apps are doing that can help us automate some of the processes, so that we have a scope for this. We're definitely going to be utilizing some automation for 340B payers. That's also a large chunk of what our business does.

Being a not-for-profit organization allows us to utilize that government program. That's very important to us. Epic is always trying to stay one step ahead of the landscape where everything is. We're glad to have some competition coming in and showing us some other solutions that can improve our productivity as a department, increase the bottom line.

## Client
Got it. What's the set of processes then? Just to break it down, I think there are some players on the infusion side or on the specialty pharmacy side that do everything from, as they say, script to chair, so eligibility check and all the different steps, in addition to scheduling and getting the billing RCM components on the backside as well. When you say automating processes with Epic, it could mean many different things. Just trying to make sure we understand which processes you're talking about as it relates to specialty pharmacy and/or infusion.

## Expert
Our specialty pharmacy, the only stuff we have fully automated right now is related to claims, so prior authorization, claim rejection, Epic also. A lot of times, when the claims are rejected, there's a lot of manual processes. I'm talking about specialty pharmacy. Outpatient infusion is a totally different ballgame. We're not using it for that as far as I know. There's tons of claim rejections if you look at a single transaction or a single Rx that goes through.

Oftentimes, there are going to be issues on what we're sending to what a payer is receiving. You can see that manually clicking into and looking at a summary of the report, what line on the payer sheet was not accepted or rejected. Why was it rejected? I have technicians that are going back into Epic, manually readjusting what is being sent, adding different lines, sending different things.

Getting that stuff automated, if we have an LLM that can look and read why this is rejected, what can we do to get this approved and sent over, it's more or less a basic thing to do for LLM. That's the stuff we're looking at right now and that's what we're utilizing it for. On the end part, when the claim goes out to when we get it back. I can't really speak to utilization on the intake side. This is right at the point of sale, so the end part of the process here.

## Client
For Latent, what are the key metrics that you're tracking during this pilot period? What are your decision points to determine if you go to an actual contract?

## Expert
Key metrics, importantly, is we're seeing just flat number, how many of these prior auths are resolved per day, per month, per week as compared to in the past. Secondly, important to us is our employee satisfaction. How do they like using it? Is it easy for them? Does it make their life easier? Is it fun to use? That's an important thing for that. Those are the two main metrics we're looking at in the pilot phase.

Of course, I'm sure the finance people can break that down into more dollar value. As far as on the pharmacy side, just the productivity and do the employees like to use it. There are other solutions out there, just they don't like using it. They end up going back into the portal and using a custom product instead, when they should be using this, then it's not really worth using though, is it?

## Client
Two questions on that. One, do you have a sense of what increase in prior authorization resolution would be meaningful for Northwestern on a percent increase over what is baseline?

## Expert
That's a good question. I don't have the exact percentage numbers and drop down. It is more of a VP-type question, I think, what they're looking for when it comes to that. I really can't give you an accurate answer for that, unfortunately.

## Client
No worries. The second was, it sounds like you guys are using Latent for specialty pharmacy. For the other care settings like infusion, have you guys looked at different solutions specific to those care settings?

Yeah. The different solutions, for those, right now, main solutions that we're mostly excited about that we put in were smart pumps. As far as using AI stuff for that, we're not quite there right now. The technology we're using for that is, again, focused on robotics and smart pumps right now. We're not utilizing whatever the newest AI product is for or infusion or anything like that.

## Client
Got it. Folks like Mandolin, building end-to-end revenue cycle automation for the infusion space, those haven't come up yet?

## Expert
That's correct. We utilize Epic for all that.

## Client
Got it. How would you rank figuring out the optimal revenue cycle tech stack in specialty pharmacy, in infusion, in acute in terms of prioritization for where the leadership team is allocating time and resources among the other priorities you may have at Northwestern?

## Expert
As far as my knowledge of that ongoing project for this year, for the acute care, we have some of these delivery robots that are running medications. We're upgrading our cabinets, upgrading that software in the cabinet. That's the main look right now. Big project. Specialty pharmacy, we currently are piloting Latent Health. That's the only third-party AI app we're utilizing right now. For the inpatient and outpatient side, we're still pretty siloed on EpicCare and EpicCare suite of programs. We haven't really felt the need to go outside.

We do have an in-house innovation department that is utilizing different Microsoft products and other products to build stuff in-house, actually. You have stuff looking at radiology and surgery scheduling coming across. These are more in-house built stuff that we're using being partnered with some of these other large companies. We like to keep a lot of stuff in-house that we do, especially with our new innovation department.

## Client
Got it. Maybe last question on my end. Obviously, for health system Northwestern, revenue leakage is big issue, like claims denials that don't get resolved. Do you have a sense of what percentage of revenue is lost through claims that are wrongfully denied?

## Expert
I don't have exact numbers on that. I can connect you with people that do have that information, pretty easily. If you want to reach back out to your rep, can definitely put you in touch with some of those people if that's of interest to you. The revenue leakage that I'm aware of is due to a few different things that our application teams are always looking to resolve. Again, it's like system builds that's incorrect can be causing these things to go out.

Last quarter, we had probably like a small difference of our book value and that was mostly due to incorrect pricing put into the Epic software. When the medications get loaded, the pricing is incorrect. It did cause quite a large skew there. We were able to resolve that in-house, but again, that was just all due to pricing error from Epic. Once we can get that removed, I think we'll be in a better spot, but now, we did some RCA on that. I figured out how to not have the incorrect pricing put in. That's about all I can say about that.

## Client
Got it. Really appreciate your time. Have a good day.
