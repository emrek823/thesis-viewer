We can become a billion-dollar company.

Many founders say this casually during their venture pitch or to prospective employees, but it is a serious statement that requires serious evidence: the priors of a VC-backed Seed-stage startup becoming a unicorn are just 2% (and potentially lower if re-capitalized today).

But we've had a fantastic 2022 (ending at $1.1M ARR) and we're optimistic about 2023 (projecting $5.8M ARR):

### Revenue and growth projections for SmarterDx vs. a typical unicorn

**Chart Data Extraction (from Page 2, larger chart, and text where noted)**
*(Note: There is a significant visual discrepancy in the "SmarterDx" ARR plotted on the chart vs. the textual "$1.1M ARR" for 2022 and "$5.8M ARR" for 2023. The data below uses the textual ARR for 2022/2023 and calculates subsequent SmarterDx ARR using the estimated YoY Growth from the blue dashed line. "Typical unicorn" ARR and all YoY Growth values are estimated directly from the chart on Page 2.)*
*(Further Note: The "Typical unicorn" ARR visual data differs significantly between Page 1 and Page 2. The data below uses Page 2's visual representation.)*

| 2027 | ~0% |

That said, if we zoom out, it's clear that we've only taken the first of many steps:

---

### There are five requirements to achieve a $1B dollar valuation.

1.  Capturable-value in excess of $100M / year ("market size")
2.  Product-market-fit.
3.  Customer acquisition at scale.
4.  Customer optimization at scale.
5.  Increasing value and PMF over time.

The last requirement is characterized in different ways: building a moat, conquering a smaller market and moving onto a larger one, riding technological tailwinds, etc., but what is universally true is that nothing remains static – they either grow or shrink – and we have to find and walk a path that allows us to grow over many years.

---

### Our right to exist

Healthcare has many processes and requirements. The size of the industry is constrained: growth largely matches inflation. The corollary is that many human touches are needed from start to finish and that the average touch has low value (if revenue is fixed, and actions increase, then the value-per-action must decrease). The other corollary is that more money spent on administration means less money spent on patient care.

Everybody agrees that there is significant room for disruption but the barriers to entry are high: these touches largely take place within deeply embedded software platforms that are incredibly hard to displace.

However, although the *average* value of each touch is low, in some areas a small minority of touches deliver an extreme majority of value and the remainder almost none. Our core thesis is that:

1.  It's possible to use wide datasets to identify these high value touches.
2.  For these high value touches, “new” processes are justified (if you have a metal detector, it becomes reasonable to comb the beach for treasure).
3.  Since these processes are new, they are not captured by existing platforms.
4.  Over time, if we can capture all the value with the new process, customers will have no reason to continue the old process.

From the customers perspective:

> We bring real value (fully-attributable dollars)
> with minimum risk (no upfront fees, no operational changes, superficial IT integration).

---

### Metrics

Given these, our North Star metric and its immediate derivatives become clear:

**SmarterDx revenue = Attributable customer value x (% Captured)**
**Attributable customer value = (# Recs) x (Attributable value per rec) x (% Actioned)**

Several additional (some overlapping) metrics are needed to support the above five requirements for a billion-dollar company:

### Capturable-value

How much attributable value do we find for customers per-100-beds?
% Captured by SmarterDx

There are about 920,000 hospital beds in the U.S. We have delivered about $15M and captured $1.1M in revenue across about 1,900 beds. The trend appears to be stable month-over-month. Thus, a bottoms-up calculation suggests a market size of about $530M / year.

Of note, our "take" was about 6.6% of value created for the customer. Current contracts in negotiation are as high as 20%. This would equate to a market size in excess of $1.5B / year.

### Product-market fit

Net dollar retention
What percent of existing customers are referenceable, and how quickly?
What percent of existing customers ask us to expand, and how quickly?

Both of our customers were referenceable within 3 months. Both have asked us to expand (McLaren within 3 months; Montefiore within 7 months). Importantly, neither of these expansions were "free actions" for the customer:

1.  The remaining McLaren sites are not on the same EMR.
2.  Montefiore's other sites do not share the same leadership (separate CFO, CMO, CQO, VP Revenue Cycle), the same CDI and Coding teams, or the same legal review.

### Customer acquisition at scale

How many customers do we have a serious conversation with per month?
What percent of prospective customers do we "close"?
How long does it take?
What is the CAC?

6 out of 8 customers in our pipeline originated from groundwork completed in 2021:

-   AMN connection → Premier → McLaren → UHS
-   NYP connection → WPH → Montefiore
-   NYP connection → prior UAMS meeting → UAMS
-   NYP connection → Houston Methodist

Word-of-mouth (AMN connected us with Premier; Premier connected us with UHS after seeing results at McLaren; NYP) is our strongest sales channel.

Of the remaining two, one (UCSF) originated from Sandra's personal network and one (Insight Chicago) from the three conferences we went to (Beckers x 2 and Marcus Evans). Although there is still opportunity to gain customers from those conferences, the present CAC is high:

(Beckers x 2) + (Marcus Evans) + Sandra's salary x 6 months → 1 hospital

Thus, CAC is about $130K

### Customer optimization at scale

What is our implementation time per customer?
What is the IT implementation time per customer?
What is our COGS (human-in-the-loop cost + servicing cost) as a fraction of revenue?
How many Clinical Ops people (human-in-the-loop count) are needed per $10M in customer value?
What fraction of regular operations requires Mike, Josh, Nathan, or Parimal's time?

There are two significant components to customer implementation: the first is the IT integration and the second is the human-in-the-loop (HITL) delivery of valid recommendations.

We also do not know if our company will eventually require 100 or 1,000 people acting as HITL at scale (1,000 hospitals; of course we are aiming for fewer). This will significantly affect the shape of the company.

### Increasing value and PMF over time

Revenue from Prebill product stable over time
Are we identifying new product areas that can be over time?

We are not within one year of having a moat through network effects (e.g. providing a two-sided marketplace including payors) or wholly owning a core function (e.g. replacing CDI or providing a clinical data warehouse).

However, we do have a strong competitive advantage in that we have very wide data with both clinical and financial elements. This data allows us to create new products.

Thus, Elon Musk's famous quote about applies especially to us:

> "[Moats are] like nice in a sort of quaint, vestigial way. If your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace of innovation. That is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness.”

Although not yet developed, we have one new product hypothesis: that we can ingest surgical data to identify cases where the procedure performed does not match the prior authorization. Four customers and potential customers have indicated interest (WPH, McLaren, UCSF, Stanford). We are in the process of sizing the opportunity in this area.

---

### What does good look like?

We need to double the rate of customers about every half year (which is the same as 4X YoY):

| | 2022H1 | 2022H2 | 2023H1 | 2023H2 | 2024H1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| New customer rate | 1 / half-year | 1 / quarter | 2 / quarter | 1 / month | 2 / month |
| Total customers | 1 | 3 | 7 | 15 | 31 |

The below target metrics will set us up for 2024 (not all of these are currently measured or meant to be quantitatively measured).

Discussed in more detail below: at the root of all of these tasks are people. Thus, there are two additional metrics around hiring that are critical:

### People Metrics

| Status | Metric | Current rate | Target rate (2023) |
|:-------|:---------------------------|:-------------|:-------------------|
| 🔴     | \# Potential new hires per month | Need to measure | 5                  |
| 🔴     | % Retained after 1 year (excluding ClinOps and Interns) | ≤ 7/16 (≤ 44%) | 65%                |

---

### People and Process

The metrics match our intuition: the product is strong but we are very much in the process of building a company to deliver that product.

As mentioned above, 6 out of 8 customers in our pipeline originated from groundwork completed in 2021. But this does not just apply to Sales:

-   Product: Prebill product identified in 2021
-   Engineering: Nathan recruited and Malarkey built in 2021
-   Data science: Most core algorithms (Sepsis, AKI, etc.) built in 2021
-   Clinical Ops: Parimal recruited in 2021

It is clear that outcomes are a result of hiring and management decisions made 6 - 12 months earlier. We need to ensure that our current people, process, and culture set us up for success in late 2023 and 2024.

In the last year, the team has grown from 4 people to 17. While the precise number of new team members for 2023 is unknown, what is clear is that it will need to look very different.

| | Where we need to be | What we did in 2022 |
|:---|:-----------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| **Sales** | Strong sales leader with a strong network, including potential partnerships | Depended on Michael's network and the Premier channel partnership |
| | Systematic approach to fill top-of-funnel (pre-conference outreach, etc.) | A handful of conferences (Becker's, Marcus Evans); most with poor results (minimal on-site meetings and wrong stakeholders) |
| **Marketing** | Brand awareness that improves: - The hiring funnel - The sales funnel | Largely absent |
| **Talent** | We have 65% confidence that a person we hire belongs. | Engineering hires: 4/10 * Sales + BD: 0/1 Operations: 1/2 Data science: 1/2 ** Product: 2/2 ** Interns: 0/2 ClinOps hires: 3/4 *** |
| | We systematically identify potential new hires. | * see below, includes ZB + MH ** assumes PY and JZ pan out *** may need higher expectations |
| **Product** | Find the headspace to deliver new valuable product lines. | Focused on getting the core parts of the product functional (daily review, HITL, customer workflows) |
| **Engineering** | Contextualize sprints to annual goals. | Executed well on building out MVP. |
| | Planning more than one month out. | Slow diagnosis and repair of low engineering velocity. |
| | Faster engineering velocity. | Made 10 engineering hires: - 1 (Zach) is great. - 2 (Marvin, Cris) are par? - 1 (Richard) is unknown, although promising. - 6 have failed for a variety of reasons, including technical chops, work ethic, judgment, ability to work remote. |
| **Clinical Ops** | Should push more towards taking over parts of customer success and QA. | Executed well on the first two clients; Parimal not critical to day-to-day findings but there is a negative impact (estimated to be 10 - 20%). |
| | Test whether we can use RNs and Coders (not just PAs) to run the daily process. | |
| **Data Science** | Less human variance on what is recovered. | Identified and built out new triggers, cleaned old triggers, but largely not in a systematic way. |
| | Systematically improves triggers by 50% (half the human cost per unit revenue, without a decrease in revenue) | |

### Speed or quality? Yes to both.

In 2021, we had very little reason to exist. No product was proven. No customer revenue was created. No customers were referenceable. It's notable that we still got AMN to work with us and introduce us to Premier and McLaren in this context. The times where we went far above what was required – like the delivery of the Montefiore report despite it being “AMN’s job" – have paid dividends (Montefiore is now a likely customer).

We succeeded because we were able to deliver extreme quality with extreme speed. This is especially important because the customer often is not in a position to directly evaluate our impact: Christine at AMN did not personally review every finding; PJ (VP of Finance) at Montefiore had to decide whether to trust us or trust her team (who were defensive and suggested that all was going well and that there were minimal missed findings). Their impression of us is every bit as important as our results.

The underlying principles that allowed us to deliver extreme quality at extreme speed were:

1.  Extreme ownership
2.  Short iteration loops between Eng, Product, and ClinOps
3.  Talent
4.  Ability to work effectively in a remote setting (certain communication skills such as being able to "pull" context instead of expecting it to be delivered, and being super proactive when one is struggling)

These characteristics continue to define our culture and our expectations. But we've begun to fall short here and there, primarily because *how* we maintain these qualities as an organization is different from having these qualities intrinsically as a small group of initial people, and because the complexity of our product and the number of deliverables has increased. We have to arrest this and turn things back around.

Some examples of failures include:

-   Data feed. Eight months with minimal agreement on the strategy behind the data feed.
-   Customer deliverables. Shawn asked for some analytics (list of cases with identifiers). But we did not assign a clear owner and a deadline, so she had to ask again. Query templates were promised by late summer but delivered in early December.

To fix this, a few things need to happen ASAP.

1.  The company as a whole and each department needs a North Star and a strategy. As Eisenhower once said, “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything."
2.  Product and Engineering leadership need to work together more closely (it doesn't matter at what volume).
3.  Each person needs to understand their expectations. Individual sprints and what each person accomplishes needs to map to what we expect on a quarterly and annual basis.
4.  Each task needs an owner and a deadline.
5.  Each meeting needs an agenda and a purpose. Note that everyone has to participate in creating these – not just read them.
6.  We need to hire people who fit the above qualities and remove those who don't.

### Budgeting

Our current balance sheet is as follows:

| Assets | |
|:---|:---|
| Cash balance | $4,295,985 |
| Accounts receivable | |
| WPH | $91,178 |
| McLaren | $150,000 |
| **Liabilities** | |
| Credit cards | -$23,221 |
| Burkland | -$2,017 |
| Jeremiah | -$6,000 |
| **Net** | **$4,505,925** |

We need to make additional hires in 2023H1 (below) and in 2023H2.

| Role | Budget (annual) | Why / characteristics |
|:---|:---|:---|
| VP Sales | N/A (replacement) | The existing leader cannot grow into this position |
| COO / VP Ops or CoS | $140 - 200K | Mike needs to be more externally facing. Josh and Nathan are super busy and it's hard for them to free up the time to focus on pace. |
| Customer success | $160-200K | Need a LC equivalent (consulting, can navigate discussions with C-level people) |
| FS Eng | $200K | Replace Nathan's IC work |
| FS Data Eng or Head of Data Eng | $200K | Set up and execute a data strategy for company |
| IT PM | $150 - 180K | Help coordinate IT integration PM for new customers |
| ClinOps x 4 | $700 - 900K | Support expansion to $4M ARR |
| Recruiting | $200K (one-time) | |

Additionally, we need to set aside about $350K for Sales and Marketing purposes for HFMA, Beckers, ACDIS, AHIMA, and an SDR service (Memory Blue). If we can get five customers from this, the CAC per $1M first-year revenue should be under $200K ($70K + Sales salary + Sales commissions).

This will bring us to the following by the end of 2023:

| | |
|:---|:---|
| Revenue | $5.8M / year |
| People costs | $6.3M / year |
| Other costs | $1.1M / year |

| Net burn | -$1.5M / year |
|:---|:---|
| Cash out date | September 2024 |

---

### Major tasks for 2022Q1:

| | Tasks | Questions to answer |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Sales** | Land UHS | If we hire a new sales leader, can they scale up sales outside of Mike's network? |
| | Get 3 - 5 other customers signed or close to signature (Insight Chicago, Brookdale, Genesis?) | |
| **Marketing** | Initiate marketing push Feb 2023 | How much can marketing help our hiring and sales funnel? |
| **Engineering** | Nathan is no longer critical for day-to-day IC work | Can we successfully hire a FS and Data Eng? |
| | Product has core features needed to support data science work | |
| **Product** | Size the revenue potential and competitor landscape for a Surgical denials product | Does our data pipeline support a second product line? |
| | Improve Malarkey to a point that ClinOps feels confident a new person can use it | How much better can our product get? |
| **Data science** | We are systematically improving the algorithms and we get a 10% improvement in precision without hurting recall | If we tackle low hanging fruit, how many ClinOps people will we need per $1M in revenue? |
| **Clinical Ops** | Test PAs in Customer success and QA roles | Can we identify non-PAs who can act in a ClinOps capacity? |
| **CS** | Bring more of McLaren online | Can we find an IT PM who can potentially guide a customer through IT implementation? |
| | Maintain McLaren and WPH as referenceable customers | |
| | Navigate three of: UAMS, Montefiore, Insight Chicago, and UHS to "live" status | |
| **Ops** | Have a nucleus of people, process, and culture that we're proud of. | Can we use someone external to help us improve our internal cadence? |
