## Slide 1: ZÓCALO Health - Title Slide

(Image of a father kissing a baby with "ZÓCALO Health" overlayed)

## Slide 2: Introducing ZÓCALO Health

Our vision is to improve the health and wellness of Latino communities through culturally aligned, tech-enabled, community-oriented primary care.

*   Technology-enabled, integrated platform to deliver efficient, culturally proficient health & social care
*   Initial focus on a new Enhanced Care Management (ECM) program from CA Medicaid, representing a $1B opportunity for Latino members alone
*   Raising $2M seed extension to execute on signed contracts ($5.4M in 2024 revenue) and lay foundation for expansion in CA and beyond

## Slide 3: Millions of Latinos Need Zócalo Health - Opportunity Summary

### US Latino population is large and growing

*   Latinos currently represent 18% of the U.S. population
*   Latinos will be 30% of the population by 2050 at ~100M
*   Population growing faster than any other group in the US

### Latinos are currently underserved by US Healthcare system

*   1 in 3 Latinos report no access to healthcare
*   Up to 3 month waits for PCP appointments
*   <6% of physicians speak Spanish
*   Below average engagement with providers leads to poor outcomes and high costs

### Publicly funded healthcare rewards risk management

*   Latinos make up ~30% of Medicaid beneficiaries nationwide, with 59+% in California
*   Risk adjustment programs align with ZH care management capabilities
*   Reimbursement for CHWs & Enhanced Care Management

**MediCal (CA)** now available to over 700,000 undocumented immigrants

## Slide 4: Bridging the Gap: Healthcare Disparities in the Latino Community

### Challenges for Patients

*   **Access & Convenience:** Limited availability, extended wait times, and inconvenient locations.
*   **Navigational complexity:** A one-size-fits-all healthcare system that is hard to navigate and use.
*   **Cultural Misalignment:** Lack of culturally aligned health resources, providers, and educational materials.
*   **Language Barriers:** Inadequate services in the patient's native language and cultural context.

### Challenges for Health Plans

*   **Cultural Competency & Engagement:** Challenges in engaging Latino communities due to non-tailored services and lack of cultural insights
*   **Performance & Equity:** Poor outcomes in key health metrics for Latinos, highlighting significant care and equity gaps.
*   **Resource Allocation & Community Trust:** Inadequate culturally competent resources, impacting care coordination and community trust
*   **Equitable Access & SDOH Integration:** Struggles to provide equitable access and address social determinants of health effectively in Latino areas.

## Slide 5: A Latino Focused Care Model That fills critical care gaps in Latino communities

Our community-oriented care model is centered around the effective use of Community Health Workers (CHW) and begins with engagement & trust building. We then enable comprehensive care that is culturally aligned and is effective in driving positive member outcomes and financial results.

**Process Flow:**
Engagement -> Integrated Care -> Member Outcomes

**Key Roles in Care Model (Wheel Diagram):**

*   **Center:** PdS (presumably Patient/Member, represented by a smiling woman)
*   **Inner Circle:** CHW (Community Health Worker)
*   **Outer Segments (clockwise from top):**
    *   Behavioral Health
    *   Social Services
    *   Urgent Care
    *   Complex Care Mgmt.
    *   Care Coordination
    *   Primary Care
*   **Overarching concept:** Cultural Proficiency

**Metric:**
94.7 Net Promotor Score

## Slide 6: Community-Oriented Primary Care for Latinos, by Latinos.

Our advanced primary care team is comprised of our community health partners, nurses, physicians, behavior health professionals as well as non-clinical coordinators to expand access and deliver an elevated member experience.

### Primary Care

We coordinate with members' existing primary care providers or match members with Zócalo Health providers based on their personal preferences and needs.
**Roles:** Clinician, CHW

### Behavioral Health

We provide therapy, support groups and family counseling.
**Roles:** Clinician, CHW, CBO (Community Based Organization)

### Social Services

We help coordinate housing, employment, legal aid, food, childcare and other services members might need.
**Roles:** CHW, CBO

### Care Coordination

We work with members' doctors, specialists, and case managers to arrange home-based care, in-person appointments, and virtual support as needed.
**Roles:** Clinician, CHW

### Complex Care Management

Our care teams are experienced at working with members with complex needs that make it difficult to improve their health.
**Roles:** Clinician, CHW, CBO

### Urgent Care

Members can call us for any urgent needs. We're expanding hours to include 24/7 in 2025.
**Roles:** Clinician

## Slide 7: Z_H_ Care Model in Action

**Maria's Profile:**
Maria is a 65-year-old Latina with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and a recent history of congestive heart failure. She resides alone in Merced, CA, a community with limited access to healthcare services, and is a beneficiary of MediCal, California's Medicaid program. Maria struggles with English, which makes navigating the healthcare system challenging for her.

### Without Zócalo Health

Maria has several emergency room visits due to poorly managed diabetes and hypertension. Her conditions have been exacerbated by her difficulty in following dietary recommendations and medication schedules, partly due to cultural preferences and language barriers.

**Estimated Annual Costs:**
*   4 ER visits a year at an average cost of $2,000 each: **$8,000**
*   1 hospitalization for congestive heart failure: **$15,000**
*   Monthly medications for diabetes and hypertension ($300/month): **$3,600**
*   Potential additional costs for complications (e.g., kidney issues, additional hospital): **$5,000 - $20,000**
*   **Total Estimated Annual Costs (Without Zócalo Health): $31,000 - $46,000**

### With Zócalo Health

After her first ER visit, Maria is referred to ZH through her health plan. A CHW is informed of her discharge and visits her at home soon after discharge to enroll her in the ECM program.

**Zócalo Health Services:**
*   Comprehensive Care Assessment
*   Personalized Care Plan
*   CHW Led Care Coordination
*   Social Support Integration
*   Ongoing Monitoring & Adjustment

**Estimated Annual Costs & Savings:**
*   **Cost with Zócalo Health: $12,000 - $16,000**
*   **(Savings of 65.2%)**

## Slide 13: $2M Seed Extension: Key Milestones to Raise Series A

1.  **Execute on current contracts** - ECM ($625 PMPM with Alliance) and commercial contracts (Blue Shield of CA) - in CA to secure attractive reimbursement and demonstrate success (enrollment rates, clinical outcomes, cost-savings)
2.  **Demonstrate ability to scale capacity** with CHWs (increasing capacity from 50 to 150+ members) while maintaining strong outcomes and internal processes (hiring, training, etc)
3.  **Continue expansion to additional LOBs in 2025:** by enrolling in high risk populations via Medicaid we will have the foundation and risk profile to start working with other LOBs such as Medicare in 2025.

**Timeline & Growth Focus:**

**H1 2024**
*   **Growth Focus:** Capitated ECM services to Medicaid population for 1 health plan, 3 counties, 697 patients
*   **Core Population:** Medicaid ECM & Commercial
