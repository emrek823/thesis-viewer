### Market & Competitive Landscape

- Large scale market showing increased openness to switching from big three
- Driving factors:
	- Fiduciary responsibility issues
	- Liability being thrown back to employer
	- Contractual liability being met but costs continuing to increase
- Press announcements showing wins with Fortune 50/100 customers
- No direct competitors - Truveris and others just resell basic tools
- Only competitor Rx Rains (MGU) has left market, book of business available

### Product Suite & Revenue

Three complementary products:

- PMPM Guarantee:

- Maintains existing stop loss
- Seeds aggregate pharmacy liability
- Enables 15-20% reduction in overall premium
- Key clients: Excel, Health in Tech (30-40k members rolling on 6/1)

- RxProtect:

- Sirius partnership performing well (0% loss ratio)
- Seeking limit increase to $10M
- Faculty approval process now smooth
- Panel diversification planned for 2026
- Net income through 50/50 quota share

- Subscription Product:

- Fastest sales cycle - no member liability or TPA integration
- Fixed rate pricing
- Popular for smaller groups (<250 members)
- Bolt-on pharmacy product

### Go-to-Market Learnings

- RxProtect follows typical insurance sales cycle (7/1, 8/1, 10/1 starts)
- Subscription product has quickest adoption due to simplicity
- PMPM ideal for blocks vs individual groups
- Integration dependencies with TPAs can extend timeline (30-90 days)
- Strategy: Focus on pre-integrated PBM/TPA combinations
- Surprising PBM receptivity to value proposition

### Technology Platform Updates

- PBM auditing tool launched
- 86% accuracy on variance prediction
- Enhanced modeling:
	- Each super claimant modeled independently
	- Successfully predicted outcomes for 30k and 3k life groups
	- Validated against 2024 actual results
- AWP pricing integration
- Automated contract analysis

### Strategic Considerations

Two paths forward:

- Continue current trajectory (“we’ll be fine”)
- Accelerate growth (“throw real kerosene”)

Key requirements to scale:

- Optimize underwriting partner workflow
- Develop J-code risk management capability
- Define specialty risk management strategy
- Enhance trend/drug mix calculations
- Expand customer support

Market focus:

- Initial focus on small/mid-market
- Large employers slower adoption due to big three relationships
- Broad applicability across Medicare Advantage, hospitals, unions, municipalities
