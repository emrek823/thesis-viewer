# Spotlight: Evvy's care platform 👩‍⚕️

*   Some high level updates & reminders on our care platform
    *   Evvy's care platform will provide personalized Rx medications & supplements based on a patient's microbiome, symptoms, and health profile — all compounded specifically for that individual (plus 1-1 coaching)
    *   Launching care achieves 3 primary goals for Evvy:
        *   Allows us to reach a wider customer base (people who want solutions, not just info) & expands value for existing customers
        *   Builds a closed loop dataset that unlocks opportunities in phase 3
        *   Builds Evvy's overall business margin
    *   Goal of soft launching in Q4 2022 and publicly launching in Q1 2023 🙂
*   Updates on our clinical study
    *   We designed the first ever personalized vaginal healthcare pathways based on Evvy's dataset (these are the pathways that our care platform will offer)
    *   To validate the care pathways, we launched a study in Q2 to evaluate their effectiveness compared to the existing standard of care
    *   40+ participants are currently enrolled in study (taking 3 Evvy tests across 2 months of custom treatments)
    *   We're seeing really promising & exciting early results — we will share the official whitepaper in Q1!
        *   90% of participants have shifted from dysbiosis to a protective state and experienced a reduction in persistent symptoms
*   Updates on rebuilding our test (in partnership with MicrogendDx)
    *   We've been in the process of rebuilding our test from scratch with a clinical NGS microbiome lab
    *   Optimizing wetlab & bioinformatics protocols for clinical analysis of vaginal samples
        *   The new pipeline leverages our proprietary reference database!
    *   We're currently aiming to finish CLIA/CAP validation by Nov, and then CLEP validation by Jan
*   Updates on the telehealth platform (in partnership with Wheel)
    *   Building clinical & digital integration with Wheel so that their MDs in all 50 states can order our test and prescribe our custom care pathways based on the guidelines that we ran the study on
    *   Building new digital experiences allowing patients to opt into care, view their personalized treatment plan, set up time with their coach, and join the Evvy community
    *   Integrating more closely with our chosen lab and pharmacy partners to create a seamless care experience for the patient

# Research & Data 🔬🧬

*   Dimensionality reduction
    *   Our data scientist ran an initial dimensionality reduction experiment to understand how we can best leverage complex microbial data for disease prediction and classification models.
        *   One V1 model was able to predict whether someone was in menopause or not with 85% accuracy.
    *   While there is a lot more to do here, this is exciting initial validation that the information Evvy is collecting via metagenomic sequencing is valuable for accurate disease prediction.
*   MAG (metagenome assembled genome) Pipeline
    *   We have been able to generate high quality genomes from our metagenomic data. The pipeline has been optimized and is currently running on all 6000 samples. The output of this will be assembled microbial genome data from individual samples.
    *   This data will be used for biomarker discovery outside of traditional taxonomic classification. This data will allow for novel analysis into sub-species variation, genetic content comparisons, and even in/del and SNP identification.
*   SAGE database completed
    *   The Select annotated genome (SAGE) database has been compiled from 4315 genomes representing 712 species isolated specifically from the urogenital and vaginal tract.
        *   For comparison, the publicly available Virgo database only contains 264 species
    *   Evvy's proprietary reference genome database is being implemented in the clinical version of our test to provide more accurate taxonomic classification.
*   First publication accepted to [mSystems](https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems) Journal in collaboration with UVA Computational Systems Biology Lab
    *   Title: *Metabolic network models of the Gardnerella pangenome identify key interactions in the vaginal environment*
    *   mSystems is part of the American Society for Microbiology Papers with a high impact factor

# More details for the overachievers 🤓

*   The two user personas we're currently focused on:
    *   "Facebook Group Gale" — she has recurrent infections and has "tried everything" when it comes to treatments. We often find her in vaginal health Facebook support groups, hence the name! Receiving comprehensive information and novel insights are top priorities for you.
    *   "Symptoms Sara" — she has mystery symptoms and has tried traditional Rx solutions to no avail. Medical legitimacy and a great user experience are top priorities for her.
    *   We're adjusting our new channel tests based on where we're likely to find these two user personas.
*   Excitingly, most users consistently give Evvy a 10 in their NPS feedback survey. Below is an NPS breakdown and a couple of customer quotes from September:

## NPS Categories (Pie Chart Data)
*   **Promoters:** 79.70%
*   **Detractors:** 12.05%
*   **Passives:** 8.25%
*   **TOTAL:** 100%

*   "Love everything about Evvy! I got a very in depth and clear explanation about what's going on with my vaginal microbiome. The support is also great, and it's so wonderful to feel like you're not alone in this."
*   "Consulting call included. Real science answers to my issues and being able to restore my biome to 99% healthy. No infections in over 9 weeks!”
*   “AMAZING way to find out what is going on with my body when HEALTHCARE can't. Without EVVY I may have not survived."
*   "My microbiome report and recommendations gave me information I never got from my OBGYN. I now feel like I have information that can help me make real progress."
*   "I finally have peace of mind about my vaginal microbiome. It's so hard to tell from symptoms alone what's going on in one's vagina, so I needed that clarity. The process was also very transparent -- even though it wasn't fast by any means, I received notifications every time my sample moved through to another stage. I really appreciated that I wasn't just left in the dark for three weeks."

# Our first team retreat / off site! 👯‍♀️🏡

The 10 of us spent two days together discussing our OKRs, goals for our values/culture, and Laine's resemblance to Nicholas Cage (see bottom right photo) 😂 Given the speed at which we all talk, we also got in some time for cooking, running, and ocean cold plunging.

*Four images of the Evvy team during their retreat, showing group meals, outdoor activities, and indoor gatherings.*
