### Team Background

- Azhar and Elliot were friends in undergrad and roommates
- Elliot: Investment Banking (Healthcare), Private Equity focused on healthcare software
- Azhar: Investment Banking, Arkos, Point72; particularly interested in working with LLMs
- Built AI edtech SaaS product as experiment - scaled to 37,000 users, profitable
- Tyler (joining July 1 from Netflix): Most brilliant engineer from school, started part-time already
	- Working together since 2019
	- Working across entire codebase together
	- 10x engineer with strong mutual working relationship

### Product Vision & Strategy

- Starting with malpractice insurance as wedge into “Credit Karma for physician financial profile”
- Core physician financial needs identified through personal experience (Elliot’s wife is physician):
	- $250k student debt needing refinancing
	- Disability insurance
	- Malpractice insurance
	- New practice financing
	- New home mortgages
- Current malpractice application process:
	- Traditional: 20+ page PDF, manual COI and loss runs
	- DocShield solution: Automated 80% prepopulation for 1.1M US physicians using NPI matching
- Target market economics:
	- Average surgeon (top 20 states): $55,000/year
	- Average OB: $80,000/year
	- Florida premiums: ~$120,000/year

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Not eliminating human producers - focusing them on high-value interactions
- Regulatory considerations:
	- Disability falls under life insurance vs. P&C licensing
	- Currently licensed for P&C in 47 states
	- Can serve every other product line
	- Already executed general liability policies for initial cohort
	- Expanding into D&O policies
- Distribution strategy:
	- Using state filing data to identify market opportunities (e.g., soft market in Texas, hard market in NJ)
	- Focus on high-intent channels:
		- Payer enrollment
		- Provider credentialing
		- Medical licensing partnerships with SMB players
- Executing land grab strategy to secure most attractive channels quickly

### Operational Advantages

- Meaningful efficiency advantage demonstrated through AMS (mid-sized med mal carrier) partnership
	- Carrier directing small practice flow to DocShield
	- Traditional brokers can’t serve effectively (e.g., Willis requires $200k minimum premium)
	- Standard 10% broker commission maintained
- Ultimate vision: DocShield as trusted physician financial services brand
	- Platform for tailored financial products
	- End-to-end physician financial services

### Fundraising Status

- Launched fundraise previous Tuesday
- Targeting $3.5M (increased from initial $2.5M due to strong interest)
- Current commitments:
	- Term sheet received from fintech investor
	- Second potential term sheet expected
	- Pre-seed investor committed $750k
	- Angels/scouts capacity: $500k
- Seeking mix of healthcare + fintech/insurtech expertise
- Post-money valuation: $15-20M SAFE
- Timeline: Targeting allocation decisions by end of next day with some flexibility
