### MSK Pathology Model Results

- New model achieves state-of-the-art for predicting cancer outcomes
- Second blog post draft ready showcasing MSK collaboration
- Significant performance improvement over previous benchmarks
- Will become primary public offering to establish SMB as standard

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture
- Radiology chosen as key modality due to longitudinal standard-of-care nature
- Data delivery from Gradient expected Dec 29, one week training timeline

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send meeting schedule and teaser deck materials
- Create 10-slide teaser deck for JPM meetings
- Begin formal investor outreach for additional meetings
- Continue Sanofi contract finalization
- Finalize data processing pipeline for Gradient CTs
