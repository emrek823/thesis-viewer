* **Other notes:**
    * He is almost 5 years old and was diagnosed just over 3 years ago
    * He has some vocal language, but mostly communicates by guiding people toward what he needs
    * He had another ABA provider before (Rising Above), but they were not the right fit (inconsistent, staffing issues)

### The journey at ANNA (so far)
* Our new Weston clinical team completed the initial assessments in the Wayland clinic – one advantage of having clinics close by!
* He is beginning services at our new Weston clinic, where the team will be focused on improving: Communication, safety skills, social skills, and daily living skills

    * **Mitigant:** Evaluating strategic M&A, engaging lobbyists in top states, and expanding states of contracting
* **Corporate Culture:** Early indications of culture challenges at the corporate level
    * **Mitigant:** Change in organizational leadership, town hall meetings, more recognition

    * **Mitigant:** Hiring Director of Operations

---

## Slide 6: Company Needs
**HIGHLIGHTS, CHALLENGES, AND COMPANY NEEDS**

* **Chief Clinical Officer:** Significant cultural challenges oriented around Chief Clinical Officer, conducting a search now but helpful to have conversations with other great CMOs / CCOs to benchmark
* **General Manager Talent:** Go-to-market in new markets is a GM-led model, which requires strong talent to go 0-to-1 on the market. To discuss more.
* **National ABA / Autism Legal Experts:** Inorganic acquisition pipeline conditional on two counsel strategy: 1) Cost-effective small business M&A counsel (identified) and 2) ABA specialist at national law firm with direct connectivity to point people in target markets to provide direction

## Slide 14: Blueprint Health Fundraise Update
**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS**

* **Investment Market:** There is an increasingly unilateral focus on AI within the context of investor mindshare
* **ANNA AI Trajectory:** Early data points are that the opportunity to deploy AI into ANNA to fundamentally redefine the margin structure and scalability of the business is highly compelling
* **Extensibility:** It’s clear a similarly compelling opportunity to leverage AI exists across various outpatient healthcare services multi-site businesses, and a multi-specialty HoldCo model is uniquely positioned to capitalize on asymmetric de novo economics and extensibility of talent, playbooks, and infrastructure
* **Fundraise:** Initially tested the waters in directed conversations with a16z and Transformations Capital—strong pull from both into a fundraise that is at the partner meeting stage. Targeting $30 – 40mm at 20% dilution.
* **Approach:** These conversations represent something between a “pre-empt” and a fundraise but give strong validation to the approach and are “zero-cost call options” on pulling forward the fundraise we need at ANNA while setting the groundwork for a much bigger opportunity.

---

## Slide 15: Centralized Operations Organizational Structure
**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS**

* Currently Operations has limited bandwidth due to high-need to support HR (plan to address with pivot in approach – discussed next slide) and broad breadth of operational needs across central and field operations
* Begin to build out Operations team with Director of Operations hire (Q4 2025)
    * Initial focus on standing up enhanced reporting (especially for field operations), setting up new clinics, owning scheduling, and driving cross-functional projects
    * Longer term, owns strategic initiatives including expanding service lines and process improvements
* As we accelerate our growth (both new states and number of clinics), we plan to invest in a leader of Implementations (late Q1 2026)
    * Implementations leader could be a natural transition to a market GM role – enables us to recruit from broader talent pool than Massachusetts
* We would subsequently invest in a leader of Growth with marketing and sales expertise to support standardization and sharing of best practices for community outreach and family engagement across our markets (Q3 2026)

**Organization Hierarchy:**
* **SVP of Operations** (2025)
    * **Director of Operations** (2025)
    * **Director of Implementation** (2026 Hire)
    * **Director of Growth** (2026 Hire)
    * **Field Operations** (Not part of Central Ops)
    * **Director of Comm. Outreach & Eng.** (Not part of Central Ops)
    * **Director of TA** (Not part of Central Ops)
    * **Director of People Ops** (Not part of Central Ops)

---

## Slide 16: HR Organizational Structure
**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS**

* In Q3, added on Director of TA and Director of People Operations
    * Director of TA has supported accelerated hiring needs as we expand our clinics
    * Director of People Operations has supported rollout of BT 2.0, evaluating our benefits for 2026, improving our processes and onboarding training, and (predominately) supporting Clinical Directors with disciplinary actions
* We are repositioning HR as a strategic domain expert that partners with leaders in each department with expertise in:
    * Talent acquisition
    * People strategy
    * Organizational and professional development
* We will be rolling this refined approach in January 2025 with manager training across all managers and adding a dedicated HR Business Partner in 2026 to support managers performance managing their teams
* People Operations will transition to supporting compliance, new state expansion, and continued building of career paths across roles
* Talent Acquisition will expand to include a TA specialist to focus on BT recruiting, acknowledging the growing need for talent acquisition as we expand geographically
* We will kick-off a search to add a Chief People Officer in Q1/Q2 2026 given the importance of solidifying culture and retention before we accelerate expansion

**Organization Hierarchy:**
* **Chief People Officer** (2026 Hire)
    * **Director of TA** (2025)
        * **TA Specialist** (2026 Hire)
    * **Director of People Ops** (2025)
        * **HR Business Partner** (2026 Hire)

---

## Slide 17: Field Operations Organizational Structure
**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS**

* Each state will have 2-3 regions, with a General Manager responsible for the P&L
* Each region has 6 clinics
* Each region has a Regional Operations Director (ROD) and Regional Clinical Director (RCD)
* Clinical Directors solid line report to ROD
* RCD provides clinical support on complex cases and conducts clinical fidelity tests
* Community Outreach & Engagement Director reports to GM and oversees 4-6 specialists (2 per region) who build relationships with referral sources and engage new families

**For discussion:**
* How many localized clinical leaders are needed – i.e., at the regional level or state level sufficient?
* Community outreach and engagement approach assumes the team in the field will do both outreach and family engagement. Given the relatively low volume of families to be engaged, we favor this over centralization – how does the Board view this trade off?

**Reporting Structure:**
* **CCO** and **SVP of Operations**
    * **General Manager (State)**
        * **Regional Operations Director (Region)**
            * **Clinical Directors**
        * **Regional Clinical Director (Region)** (Dotted line to Regional Operations Director)
        * **Community Outreach & Engagement Director**
            * **Community Outreach & Engagement Specialists**

## Slide 18: Massachusetts Real Estate Review
**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS**

* **Strategy:** Build anchors with non-overlapping 20-minute drive radius’ that capture the Eastern Massachusetts market while scoping out Central and Western Massachusetts
* **Live Locations – Expand East and North**
    * Weston: Open and already seeing strong referral volume
    * Woburn Open, though still in operational launch stages
* **Q1 2026 Go Live – Expand to the South Shore**
    * Braintree (in construction, expected January ‘26) – On mass transit and captures Boston and dense cities in the 95 corridor
    * Foxborough (lease finalized) – Access to key population centers in the South (Fall River, Brockton, New Bedford)
* **Q2 2026 – Expand North and West**
    * Lowell / Lawrence (LOI stage) – Capture the market north of 95, targeting major intersecting highways
    * Worcester (Surveying) – Massachusetts’ second largest city
* **H2 2026 – Full state coverage and double down where demand**
    * Western Massachusetts – greater Springfield area first
    * Selectively add locations where demand warrants
* **7 total centers by Q1 2026 in Massachusetts represents PF Revenue ~$35mm, PF EBITDA ~$12mm, Approx $240mm TEV**

**Map Key:**
* **Existing:** Red Pins (Woburn, Weston)
* **Q1 2026:** Yellow Pins (Braintree, Foxborough)
* **Q2 2026+:** Blue Pins (Lowell, Worcester, Springfield area)
