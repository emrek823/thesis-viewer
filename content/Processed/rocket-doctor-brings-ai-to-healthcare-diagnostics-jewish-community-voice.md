Dramatic growth in artificial intelligence is raising concerns about “guardrails” that protect users from accidental bad outcomes from AI errors or misinterpretations, such as the “hallucinations” we’ve seen in the news where AI invents completely false but convincing answers.

One company in the healthcare technology industry is trying to address that concern with AI models being developed exclusively for use by medical providers.

Dr. Essam Hamza, CEO of Rocket Doctor AI, is building a “clinically governed” AI, meaning the AI model can’t reach outside a closed database of proven medical information and accidentally insert inaccurate information.

“People often think of AI as synonymous with large language models like ChatGPT,” he said. “These models, while impressive, are not designed for the precision required in healthcare. They scrape information from the internet, which can lead to inaccuracies and hallucinations. You need to be close to 100% accuracy because it’s someone’s life on the line.”

Rocket Doctor AI does not use the “large language models” typical of consumer-facing artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT or Google Gemini.

“Our AI was developed by doctors for practitioners,” he explained. The system uses a “Global Library of Medicine” (GLM), a proprietary database curated by more than 200 doctors worldwide.

This closed system ensures that the AI draws from validated, reliable sources, eliminating the risk of contamination from unverified data.

“It’s a system you can trust,” Hamza said, “because it thinks like a doctor’s brain.”

One feature of Rocket Doctor AI is its ability to personalize patient care. “The AI takes into account everything about you before it even starts talking to you,” Hamza said, including factors like age, gender, and geographical location, which are crucial in diagnosing conditions accurately. For instance, a fever in Africa might suggest malaria, while in North America, it could indicate a different ailment. Hamza believes this level of personalization is a game-changer in providing precise medical care.

The Rocket Doctor model can act as an “AI nurse,” taking patient histories and recommending tests before a doctor even sees the patient. This streamlines the process, allowing doctors to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks.

“Imagine having 24/7 access to healthcare,” he said. “When patients connect with a doctor, the history is already in the chart, and the differential diagnosis is ready to guide the consultation.”

By using a closed model of verified medical information supervised by physicians, Rocket Doctor AI is limiting its AI to a highly specialized purpose. And it seems to be proving its usefulness in field testing.

In one demonstration, the AI was integrated into an OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination), a critical component of medical training used in over 80 countries.

“We actually snuck it into one of these exams without anybody knowing except for the Dean of Medicine. And we gave it to a non-medical student, a third-year university student with zero medical education,” he said. “She was able to get 11 out of the 12 right on the first diagnosis, the 12th one on second diagnosis.”

A major concern is the job displacement likely to occur if artificial intelligence tools begin to take over tasks previously done by workers. But Hamza noted that past technological advancements like automation of testing in pathology laboratories didn’t eliminate jobs, but did require professionals to adapt and retrain.

“The field itself doesn’t change, but it adapts and grows,” he said. The goal is to make healthcare more efficient, allowing doctors to spend more time with patients who truly need their expertise.

“It’s not about guessing anymore,” he said. “It’s about precision care and seeing direct results in outcomes.”

About 300 doctors are currently using the platform across North America. The company has plans to roll out Rocket Doctor AI in New York, California, and Maryland.
