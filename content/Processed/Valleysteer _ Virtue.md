### Current Traction & Revenue Performance

- Current ARR at ~$1.4-1.5M across four active contracts
	- Vituity: $420K (monthly, cleanest contract structure)
	- Astrana: ~$500K (mix of HEDIS reviews and claims, some revenue expected to decline)
	- Belong Health: $300K ($25K/month, currently unprofitable but fixing contract)
	- Clover: $250K (annual contract, converting to monthly)
- Strong unit economics emerging: 80% gross margins, 50% OPEX margins on new contracts
- Pipeline shows ~$4M potential without new sales exec’s network

### Series A Fundraising Strategy

- Pressure from Floodgate (Anya) and NEA (Blake) to raise Series A
- Blake confirmed company has late-stage Series A metrics already
- Gerald targeting 2-2.5M ARR with monthly payments before raising
- Considering strategic investors (Intermountain, Heritage) over traditional VCs initially
- Planning to attend JPM conference to start investor conversations
- Doesn’t need capital (20 months runway) but recognizes hiring/recruiting advantages of Series A

### Product & Operations Evolution

- Launched AI platform consolidating all workflows into single product
- Reducing sales cycles from 6-9 months to target <120 days
	- Recent pipeline deals converting in <30 days
- Shifting from cost-plus to value-based pricing model
	- New medication adherence wedge: $200K per measure with Clover (3 measures)
	- Requires legal work to restructure existing agreements
- Managing offshore team restrictions for larger national payers

### Next Steps & Pipeline Development

- Belong Health contract renegotiation at 4pm today (proposal may reduce from $500K)
- Clover Care discussion Friday on 3-measure medication adherence deal
- Exploring Centene opportunity in Nashville/Mississippi region
- New sales executive starting to expand network beyond existing pipeline
- Gerald to share deck with Virtue team for feedback
