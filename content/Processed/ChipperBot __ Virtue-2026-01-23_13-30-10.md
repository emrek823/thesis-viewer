### Company Background & Team

- Josh, Tristan, Kyle - founding team with extensive biotech operations experience
- Josh: Grail (4+ years), previous Betteromics experience, 2 kids under 5
- Tristan: PhD astrophysics, software/hardware integration, Synthago background
	- “Always the software guy on hardware projects”
	- Deep understanding of ops metrics and KPIs
- Kyle: Tesla operations background, Invitae ($30M equipment spend), currently at Nexus Power ($100M annual spend)
	- Met team through Synthago via Sherman (table tennis connection)

### Product Strategy & Market Approach

- ChipperBot targets biotech/pharma operational efficiency without touching validated processes
- Key insight: Industry structured to buy software easily (like Tableau) but struggles with operational data
- Strategic positioning:
	- GMP validated processes remain untouched
	- Extract data from around validated systems
	- Focus on ops/VP buyers with clear ROI (downtime reduction, efficiency)
- Technology advantage: Modern LLMs now enable AI to read instrument logs like humans
	- “Couldn’t have done ChipperBot 5 years ago”
	- AI builds context: “Oh, you’re starting this run. Oh, this thing’s happening”

### Current Traction & Pipeline

- DTU (Denmark): Deployed for 1-2 months, successful pilot completed
- JGI: Successful pilot assessment this morning, moving forward
- Additional prospects: Solterio, Genentech, LabCorp (slower enterprise sales cycles)
- Edico (Synthago spinout): Early stage, contact recently had baby
- Revenue model: Clear ROI on downtime prevention and manual task automation

### Expansion & Investment Priorities

- Healthcare expansion opportunity:
	- Target CTOs/engineering leaders responsible for hardware maintenance
	- Hospital equipment utilization and reliability pain points
	- Need investor help with healthcare network introductions
- Team building focus:
	- Sales hiring planned for end of year/early next year
- Investor criteria:
	- Healthcare network access and introductions
	- First-time founder guidance and experience
	- Understanding of regulated industry challenges

### Next Steps

- March transition: Full-time focus after Grail stock vesting
- Wider customer outreach targeting larger pharma (longer sales cycles)
- Platform expansion: Next best action automation, root cause analysis, documentation automation
- Follow-up call scheduled with Virtue team
