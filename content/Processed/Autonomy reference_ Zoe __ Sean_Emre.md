### Background & Experience

- Overlapped with Redesign for 3.5 of 4 years; left end of last year to be London-based
- Previous experience: Finance/banking and growth equity at TPG in San Francisco
- Started at Redesign in strategy/finance role in 2021
- Currently exploring local opportunities in London while maintaining strong connection to Redesign network

### Working Relationship at Redesign

- Technically Rooshil’s senior on projects but not people manager
- Towards the end, Rooshil drove more project leadership
- Collaborated on numerous opportunities, most notably OmniTrial (clinical trial software)
- During OmniTrial: CEO quit soon after joining; had to step in to manage operating company directly
- Got unique perspective on Rooshil’s ability to manage people and technical talent

### Founder Mindset

- Unlike many who joined Redesign for exposure, Rooshil was “100% starting something”
- Focused on developing cross-functional skills beyond top-of-funnel business building
- Intentionally sought experience in:
	- Product development
	- Go-to-market strategy
	- Hiring plans
	- Operating structure

### Key Strengths

- Incredibly thoughtful with 100% of tasks
- Outstanding relationship builder; can turn difficult relationships into productive partnerships
- Shows genuine excitement and passion for deep topics
- Develops authentic perspectives; prioritizes finding right answer over being right first time
- Low ego and humble approach
- Unique IQ/EQ combination - balances big picture with granular execution
- Strong at identifying what matters and plotting path forward

### Sales & Strategic Capabilities

- Excelled at pipeline building and prospect identification
- During pitches: skillfully went off-script to capitalize on customer pain points
- Used customer interactions to refine core value propositions
- Tag-teamed sales effectively, often making senior teammate redundant on calls

### Support Recommendations

- Self-sufficient: “He’s figuring out - he knows what’s going on”
- Comfortable with setbacks and roadblocks
- More balanced than typical founders (who operate at 0 or 100)
- Key consideration: proactively remind him of available support areas
- Main concern: works extremely hard due to passion (scheduling catch-ups at 3am)

### Decision-Making Style

- Not worried about getting lost in details
- Learned from past experiences of getting too deep in non-critical areas
- Demonstrates adaptability - example: readily pivoted pitch deck based on new learnings
- “Strong opinions, loosely held” - open to new perspectives and market feedback
- Values different perspectives and genuinely seeks feedback
