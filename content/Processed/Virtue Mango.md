### Portfolio Company Reference Feedback Overview

- Evan and Andrew conducted reference calls with portfolio companies
- Key feedback themes:
	- Virtue moves quickly with conviction and comes prepared to meetings
	- Only firm to get into certain competitive rounds (Dart, Autonomy, Prudentia)
	- Approach is the reason opportunities exist in the first place
	- Consistent feedback: Virtue are “hard/tough negotiators”

### Prudentia Deal Breakdown

- Sadaqa was adamant about not raising from VCs initially
	- Planned 5-7 million seed round from GV-type firm
- Virtue convinced her to take $1M ahead of seed at discount
	- Seed closed 30 days later at $27.5-28M valuation, GV led $5M
- Could have put $2-3M in retroactively but model constraints prevented it
	- Would have been 7-8% of fund in single position within 30 days
- Fund 1 averaged 14% below market on entry prices during 4-year investment period

### Autonomy Success Story

- Founder insisted on only raising from angels
- Virtue came up from 5 different trusted sources
- Someone gave founder Emre’s email, she reached out directly
- They kicked out other investors to give Virtue full 10%
- Investment created signal leading to oversubscribed round
- Could not have gotten much more without increasing valuation

### Negotiation Strategy and Model Constraints

- Current model anchors at 10% ownership in Fund 2
	- Moving to 12-15% anchor in new model
- 80% upfront allocation vs 20% reserves out of $55M fund (net fees)
- Strategy: convince founders to take smaller round sizes (50-70% smaller)
	- Created rounds that wouldn’t have existed otherwise
- Examples of off-market raises:
	- Standard Model Bio: Kevin wasn’t raising, Virtue forced fundraise
	- Dart: Raj wasn’t raising, convinced within 72 hours to take $2M
	- Translucent: negotiated down from $10M to $4M round

### Standard Model Bio Specific Feedback

- Kevin would have taken “a few hundred thousand more”
- Thought Virtue was rushing to close deal due to shopping concerns
- Kevin clarified he wasn’t shopping term sheet around
- Context: Advanced conversations with Sanofi for $5M initial contract
	- Contract signing would change valuation from $10-12M Series A to $30-40M range
- Virtue wanted to invest before next big pharma customer signed

### Healthcare Market Positioning

- Limited competition in healthcare VC space
	- Meridian Street does different type of deals (more services-focused)
	- Rock Health not really viable for early stage
	- Andreessen’s healthcare team has reputation for highest price in room
- Quality pharma portfolio emerging: SMB, Prudentia, Solstice with real contracts
	- Standard Model Bio: $5M Sanofi contract in advanced discussions
	- Multiple pharma partnerships across portfolio companies

### Deal Allocation Analysis by Categories

- Capped deals (couldn’t get more):
	- EV Burstale: first deal, only male on cap table
	- Prudentia: already discussed
	- Clara: 15% ownership, didn’t need more
	- Right Wise: capped on entry but SPV opportunity later
	- Journey: Brian brought down cap from $30M to $20M to make room
	- SmartDx: very limited allocation, competed with Flair for remaining $600K
- Could have gotten 20-30% more:
	- Integral: should have put twice as much
	- Light Spawn: led multiple times, multiple SPVs
	- Solstice: easily could have done more
	- Anna: entry 12%, increased to 21-22% in subsequent round
	- Health MC: Rock Health did $750K, Virtue did $750K, could have taken third $750K
	- Zoom Logic: led deal with $1.5M check, could have been $2-2.5M for 12-13%
	- Translucent: could have doubled, led $1.35M deal, Jack would have taken $2.5-3M
- Could have doubled investment:
	- Hermes: capped at $500K for 10%, could have done $750K for 15%
	- Valley Steer: Gerald would have taken more, warm intro from Zen Health founders
	- Zelglo: second deal, could have been $1.5-2M check instead of $860-960K

### Fund 2 Extension Vehicle Discussion

- Discussing $25-30M parallel extension vehicle with Mango Loop
- Would allow 12-15% ownership positions vs current 10% anchor
- Portfolio model: 80-85% upfront, 15-20% reserves
- Preference for single LP (Mango Loop) to keep structure clean
- Decision timeline: materials being finalized this weekend
