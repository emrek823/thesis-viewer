# AnsibleHealth Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Tech-enabled home-based Chronic Healthcare

**AnsibleHealth**

Tech-enabled home-based
Chronic Healthcare

## Slide 2: [No slide title]

AnsibleHealth is a tech-enabled healthcare provider that leverages sensors,
machine learning, and behavioral economics, to provide patients with chronic disease
evidence-based care in the comfort of their homes.

Our vision is to become
the care-at-home provider of choice
for all patients with chronic disease.

## Slide 4: Chronic disease is pervasive in the US, yet chronic care is expensive and getting even more expensive every year.

**Chronic disease is pervasive in the US, yet chronic care is**
**expensive and getting even more expensive every year.**

**140M**
people in the US
have one or more
chronic conditions

**$3.5T**
of US healthcare spending in
2019 is for the treatment
of chronic conditions.

## Slide 5: Chronic disease patients have no chance of successfully managing their conditions today

**Chronic disease patients have no chance of successfully managing their conditions today**

**(Flowchart data points)**

*   **New Diagnosis**
    *   **Patient at Home**
        *   Patients often confused about what to do.
    *   **Post Discharge**
        *   Patients go from surrounded by hospital staff 24/7 to just being left adrift by themselves.
*   **Recovery**
*   **Lab tests and vital signs**
*   **Physician Visit**
    *   Treatment plan gets adjusted only during physician visit, typically just once every 3-6 months
*   **Stable Chronic Disease**
    *   **Treatment Inertia**
        *   Patient slowly becomes non-compliant with sub-optimal treatment plan.
*   **Acute Sickness**
*   **Hospitalization**
*   **Emergency Room**
*   **Exacerbation**
    *   In some conditions, patients have exacerbations every month.

## Slide 6: Why aren't we better at managing chronic diseases?

**Why aren't we better at managing chronic diseases?**

*   **Time**
    A typical patient gets seen, counseled, and evaluated only during their
    physician visits every 3 - 6 months, with each encounter lasting only 15
    minutes.

*   **Patient Inertia**
    We know behavioral coaching improves results, but physicians do not have
    the time or capacity to follow up with patients after they leave their offices.

*   **Lack of actionable biological data**
    Data-driven care based on daily measurements collected from patients
    at home

*   **Rapidly Evolving Best Practices**
    Over 50% of patients receive outdated or inadequate medical interventions.

## Slide 7: Ansible brings world class chronic care into a patient's home.

**Ansible brings world class chronic**
**care into a patient's home.**

*   **Remote Monitoring**
    Remote monitoring of patient vitals
    to detect exacerbations early.

*   **Patient-Centered Coaching**
    Leverage the latest in behavioral
    economics to change behaviors.

*   **Group Patient Rehab**
    Create a sense of community and
    improve patient's quality of life.

*   **ML derived insights**
    ML insights derived from clinical,
    interaction, and ambient data.

*   **Patient's healthcare gateway**
    Become the patient's primary
    interface with their care.

*   **Clinical Decision Support**
    Help physicians benefit from the
    most recent clinical insights.

## Slide 8: We initially focus on the COPD patient population due to the size of the patient population, as well as the ability to demonstrate outcomes quickly.

*   **16M**
    people in the US
    have COPD.

*   **#1**
    reason for preventable
    hospitalization and
    ED visits
    in the United States

*   **$49B**
    US healthcare
    spending on COPD,
    of which ~$23B
    preventable.

*   **COVID**
    Pulmonologists are
    also ICU doctors, and
    have basically been
    full time in ICUs.

## Slide 9: Even prior to COVID-19, many evidence-based chronic care interventions were not offered to COPD patients, and things have only gotten worse since then.

## Slide 10: Physicians for patients with COPD know they aren't providing the care that they should, but they just don't have the time or energy.

**Physicians for patients with COPD know they aren't providing the care that they**
**should, but they just don't have the time or energy.**

At the end of the day, I have four sick calls in my in-basket.
So I choose: do I stay an hour later and miss dinner and time with kids,
and answer sick calls for free or do I go home.

So I left and feel terrible about it.

I just can't do that anymore and continue to fail patients all the time
and I can't give any more of myself.

## Slide 11: We do not replace the patient's current COPD care provider. Instead, we work with them to provide the chronic care services that COPD patients aren't getting today.

*   **Environmental Sensor Data (AQI, etc)**

*   **Clinical Records**

*   **Ansible Health Platform**
    Most older patients are confused
    about technology, we've made it
    "plug power in the wall” simple.

*   **Ansible Respiratory Therapists**
    Ansible Health Respiratory
    Therapists interpret the clinical
    data, insights from our platform,
    and manage the pts.

*   **Health Coaching**
    Every 2-3 days

*   **Video based**
    **Group Rehab**
    Once a week

## Slide 12: Our services are reimbursable under Fee-for-Services (FFS) today, with each patient expected to generate revenue of ~$3400 dollars a year.

## Slide 17: We are leveraging FFS to build the foundation for a true national home-based learning health system that can scale quickly and is hard to copy

**We are leveraging FFS to build the foundation for a true national home-based**
**learning health system that can scale quickly and is hard to copy**

*   **Own the "last mile” of care delivery**
    We touch patients every 2-3 days, and will ultimately
    become the center of patient's healthcare experience.

*   **Virtual tech-enabled care that is invisible**
    Our focus is on making it easy for patients to get the
    care they deserve. We leverage technology extensively,
    but it is "invisible” to our patients.

*   **Outcome improvements easy to demonstrate.**
    On average, a severe COPD patient gets admitted every
    year. We can show outcomes like decrease
    hospitalization / ED visits within 6 months.

*   **Not health system / employer contracts dependent**
    We are able to go straight to consumers, work with
    individual physicians, and of course work with health
    systems and still get paid under FFS.

*   **Difficult to commoditize**
    We will tightly integrate our AI/ML, technical, and clinical
    workflows, making it difficult to copy any one piece and
    achieve similar outcomes.

*   **Leveraging FFS to produce outcomes for FFV**
    Start with FFS reimbursements while we generate
    evidence for FFV contracts. We aren't just praying for
    FFV to eventually become a reality to make revenue.

*   Norfolk, VA
    *   Has significant COPD patient population.
    *   Does not have corporate practice of medicine laws, allowing for faster and easier operations.
*   Initial group of patients being recruited through Facebook and Google advertising (to avoid anti-kickback conflicts)

## Slide 23: What we are looking for

**What we are looking for**

*   $3M SAFE as seed round (Target: June 7th)

*   18 months of runway to work on:
    *   Grow headcount to ~15, work with ~500 patients
    *   Product market fit on current revenue model
    *   Begin billing medicare and private payers for services.
    *   Better understand true customer acquisition costs and unit economics of patients.

*   Plan to raise further round in 12-18 months to significantly speed up patient acquisition.
