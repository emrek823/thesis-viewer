WHY NOW

Dental insurers must automate back-end tasks to improve margins due to  recent regulatory pressures & market dynamics

REGULATORY & MARKET PRESSURES ARE FORCING AUTOMATION BUT CARRIERS/DSOS STRUGGLE TO BUILD OR BUY AI SOLUTIONS Impending mandated dental loss ratios Carriers / DSOs are actively looking for AI solutions

As of 2025 in Mass, >83% of premium must go to care (vs.70% typically). Other states are  expected to emulate as happened with medical.This would require payers to cut admin  expenses to maintain margins while continuing to offer competitive premiums and benefits  offerings

Insurers and providers have historically leveraged AI/ML for image analysis (~20% of claims  require image analysis) but now want to leverage advances in LLMs to impact the other 80%  of claims/interactions

Competitive dental plans required to win market share Build: customers don’t have human capital to build internally

88% of Americans have dental insurance and >90% of MA plans (50M members) offer a dental  benefit. Insurers (e.g., CVS/Aetna,Humana) are forced to reduce admin costs for dental benefits  to continue to offer competitive benefits to attract members who see dental as a differentiator  (#2 benefit after medical)

Carriers/DSOs fundamentally cannot build product internally because they are unable to  attract engineering talent required to implement novel technology solutions, especially AI. <1%  of dental insurance organizations have built internal team for AI initiatives

Value-based care requires more benefits integration Buy: existing vendors lack dental AND AI expertise

Medical-dental integration is starting to show effective outcomes (Kaiser, BCBS), driving  adoption of more complex plan design and increased spend on manual admin resources

Existing dental specific platforms are antiquated, cumbersome and costly, (>$100M over 5  years per payer), while more general insuretech platforms aren’t purpose built for dental - resulting in lower accuracy/automation for dental workflows

Our very manual, time-consuming and error-prone processes  needed the injection of technology designed by those who have  walked more than a mile in our shoes. 32Health understands,  and has lived through, the painstaking process of credentialing  and recredentialing through their shared experiences. They  combined that history with incredibly nimble technical expertise
