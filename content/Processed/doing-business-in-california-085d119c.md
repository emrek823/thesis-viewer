3. **Franchise Tax Board (FTB) Tax Filing** - Once your entity is registered with the SOS, you are required to file a tax return with FTB for each taxable year, even if you are not conducting business or have no income. Contact FTB at [www.ftb.ca.gov](http://www.ftb.ca.gov) or (800) 852-5711 for forms and requirements concerning franchise taxes or income taxes.

Be aware, if you fail to file a return by the original or extended due date, or fail to pay taxes when due, a penalty may be imposed by FTB.

4. **Business Names and Trademarks**
Registration of a business with the Secretary of State does not in itself establish a trademark for the business name. There is a separate legal process to establish a trademark or service mark. Additionally, registration of a business with the Secretary of State does not authorize the use of a business name in violation of another person's or entity's rights to the name, such as infringement of a trademarked word or phrase.

The Secretary of State's office maintains registration and all updates of California state trademarks and service marks. Information is accessible via our California Trademark Search at [tmbizfile.sos.ca.gov/search](http://tmbizfile.sos.ca.gov/search), which also provides free PDF copies of imaged Trademark documents.

For more information on the registration of business names and registering a trademark, visit:
* General provisions governing trademarks and service marks are found in the Model State Trademark Law – California Business and Professions Code sections 14200 et seq
* Federal Trademark Act – United States Code, Title 15, Chapter 22, section 1051 et seq.
* California Fictitious Business Name Law – Business and Professions Code section 17900 et seq.
* Common law rights, including rights to a trade name.
If you have any questions regarding such rights, please consult a private attorney.

5. **Nonprofit Corporations**
Nonprofit corporations in California are not automatically exempt from paying California franchise taxes or income taxes each year. For information about tax requirements and/or applying for tax exempt status, please contact the appropriate taxing agency listed below. If you are a domestic nonprofit public benefit corporation, you likely have filing requirements with the California Office of the Attorney General.
