## Abstract

Influenza A virus (IAV) infection during pregnancy is associated with stillbirth and preterm birth, but the degree to which IAV alters placental and fetal immunity is poorly understood. The objective of our study was to determine the immunologic impact of maternal IAV infection on the placenta and fetus in a pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina) model. Pregnant pigtail macaques were inoculated with 107 plaque forming units (PFU) of IAV [A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)] and underwent necropsy 5 days post-infection (N=11). Results were compared to uninfected historical controls (N=16). IAV inoculation induced maternal pneumonia in all cases. Stillbirth occurred in 18% (2/11) of IAV-infected pregnancies, but not in controls. While vertical transmission was not observed, low-level IAV viral RNA was detected in two placentas. In the placenta, maternal IAV infection was associated with increased IL-1{beta}, IL-18, and IFN-{beta} levels, and an upregulated type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional response. IAV infection was also associated with significantly higher frequencies of intermediate and non-classical monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4 T cells, and NKT cells in the fetus (lung, lymph node, blood). Although placental immune and transcriptional perturbations were rarely correlated with maternal IAV disease indicators (e.g., maternal lung viral load/IFN-/IFN-{beta}/IL-6), there were consistent and significant correlations between these metrics and perturbed immune cell populations in the fetus (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocyte sub-populations). Maternal IAV infection disrupted both placental and fetal immune environments, but only fetal immune alterations correlated with maternal lung disease severity.
