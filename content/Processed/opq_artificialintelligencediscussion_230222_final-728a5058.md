# FDA U.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION - Artificial Intelligence in Drug Manufacturing

## CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH
## Artificial Intelligence in Drug Manufacturing
Discussion Paper | 2023

## Disclaimer
This paper is for discussion purposes only and is not a draft or final guidance. It is meant to facilitate early input from stakeholders outside the Agency. The Agency intends to consider such input in developing a future regulatory framework. As such, this document is not intended to convey any current regulation or policy related to artificial intelligence manufacturing technologies.

## Introduction
CDER's mission is to ensure that human drugs are safe and effective, meet established quality standards, and are available to patients. To advance this mission, FDA's Pharmaceutical Quality for the 21st Century Initiative promotes an efficient, agile, and flexible pharmaceutical manufacturing sector that reliably produces quality drugs without excessive regulatory oversight. Trends in drug development highlight a need for more flexibility in manufacturing.

Advanced manufacturing is a term that describes an innovative pharmaceutical manufacturing technology or approach that has the potential to improve the reliability and robustness of the manufacturing process and resilience of the supply chain. Advanced manufacturing can: (a) integrate novel technological approaches, (b) use established techniques in an innovative way, or (c) apply production methods in a new domain where there are no defined best practices. Advanced manufacturing can be used for new or currently marketed large or small molecule drug products.

FDA has recognized and embraced the potential of advanced manufacturing. In 2014, CDER established the Emerging Technology Program (ETP) to work collaboratively with companies to support the use of advanced manufacturing. CDER observed a rapid emergence of advanced manufacturing technologies through the ETP and recognized that regulatory policies and programs may need to evolve to enable timely technological adoption.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a 2021 report titled *Innovation in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing on the Horizon: Technical Challenge, Regulatory Issues, and Recommendations*, highlighting innovations in integrated pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. These innovations could have implications for measurement, modeling, and control technologies used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Artificial intelligence (AI) may play a significant role in monitoring and controlling advanced manufacturing processes.

## Scope
As FDA considers the application of its risk-based regulatory framework to the use of AI technologies in drug manufacturing, the Agency has identified in this discussion paper areas for which public feedback would be valuable. CDER scientific and policy experts identified these areas from a comprehensive analysis of existing regulatory requirements applicable to the approval of drugs manufactured using AI technologies.¹ The areas of consideration in this discussion paper are those for which FDA would like public feedback. There are additional areas of consideration not covered within this document; for example, difficulties that could result from potential ambiguity on how to apply existing Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations to AI or lack of Agency guidance or experience.² The areas of consideration presented in this discussion paper focus on the manufacture of drug products that would be marketed under a New Drug Application (NDA), Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), or Biologics License Application (BLA).

Public feedback will help inform CDER's evaluation of our existing regulatory framework. While the initial analysis focused on products regulated by CDER, FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has also encountered a rapid emergence of advanced manufacturing technologies associated with AI. As such, both CDER and CBER stakeholders are invited to provide feedback on the discussion questions.³

---
¹ This analysis included a review of applicable statutory provisions, regulations, and guidance related to quality assessment and inspections to determine whether an application presenting an advanced manufacturing technology implementing AI can fit within our current regulatory framework. The analysis did not extend to applications of AI in supply chain management of drugs.
² The areas of consideration and policy development identified in the discussion paper are not exhaustive of all application and current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) considerations. The determination of critical areas is based on CDER's analysis of the regulatory framework and stakeholder engagements through the ETP.
³ For the purposes of this discussion paper, all references to drugs include both human drugs and biological products (including those regulated by CBER), unless otherwise specified. CBER is also seeking early input from stakeholders outside the Agency on how the considerations outlined for AI may be further tailored to CBER-regulated products, many for which there is limited manufacturing experience or undefined critical quality attributes. We also note that some developers may be interested in exploring the use of AI in the bioinformatics pipelines as part of the upstream manufacturing process to generate and select candidates for precision medicine complex biological products, e.g., cancer vaccines, cellular and gene therapies, and we are interested in hearing from stakeholders on this topic.

## Background
AI offers many possibilities in the pharmaceutical industry, including but not limited to optimizing process design and process control, smart monitoring and maintenance, and trend monitoring to drive continuous improvement. The use of AI to support pharmaceutical manufacturing can be deployed with other advanced manufacturing technologies to achieve desired benefits. AI is an enabler for the implementation of an Industry 4.0 paradigm that could result in a well-controlled, hyper-connected, digitized ecosystem and pharmaceutical value chain for the manufacturer.⁴

Through interactions with industry, FDA has received valuable feedback, including potential AI use cases in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Below are examples, based on these interactions and a review of published information, that forecast how AI might be used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. These examples are not exhaustive and the potential applications of AI in pharmaceutical manufacturing may continue evolving.

*   **Process Design and Scale-up:** AI models such as machine learning—generated using process development data—could be leveraged to more quickly identify optimal processing parameters or scale-up processes, reducing development time and waste.
*   **Advanced Process Control (APC):** APC allows dynamic control of the manufacturing process to achieve a desired output. AI methods can also be used to develop process controls that can predict the progression of a process by using AI in combination with real-time sensor data. APC approaches that combine an understanding of the underlying chemical, physical, and biological transformations occurring in the manufacturing process with AI techniques are expected to see increasing adoption and have already been reported by several pharmaceutical manufacturers.

⁴ The term "Industry 4.0" refers to the fourth industrial revolution which brings together rapidly evolving technologies to dramatically change the manufacturing landscape. Industry 4.0 is characterized by integrated, autonomous, and self-organizing production systems. See Arden S, A Fisher, K Tyner, L Yu, S Lee, M Kopcha, 2021, Industry 4.0 for pharmaceutical manufacturing: Preparing for the smart factories of the future, International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 602(1), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.120554.

*   **Process Monitoring and Fault Detection:** AI methods can be used to monitor equipment and detect changes from normal performance that trigger maintenance activities, reducing process downtime. AI methods can also be used to monitor product quality, including quality of packaging (e.g., vision-based quality control that uses images of packaging, labels, or glass vials that are analyzed by AI-based software to detect deviations from the requirements of a product's given quality attribute).
*   **Trend Monitoring:** AI can be used to examine consumer complaints and deviation reports containing large volumes of text to identify cluster problem areas and prioritize areas for continual improvement. This offers the advantage of identifying trends in manufacturing-related deviations to support a more comprehensive root cause identification. AI methods integrated with process performance and process capability metrics can be used to proactively monitor manufacturing operations for trends. These methods can also predict thresholds for triggering corrective and preventive action effectiveness evaluations.

## Terminology

Discussion Paper: Artificial Intelligence in Drug Manufacturing | 5

*   **Metadata:** Contextual information required to understand data.
*   **Edge Computing:** A distributed form of computing done at or near a particular data source.
*   **Data Management:** The processes for collecting, storing, organizing, maintaining, and securing data created by an organization.
*   **Internet of Things (IOT):** A type of cyber-physical system comprising interconnected computing devices, sensors, instruments, and equipment integrated online into a cohesive network of devices that contain the hardware, software, firmware, and actuators which allow the devices to connect, interact, and exchange data and information. IOT devices include sensors, controllers, and mechanical equipment.

## Areas of Consideration Associated with AI
### 1. Cloud applications may affect oversight of pharmaceutical manufacturing data and records.
With evolving developments in cloud and edge computing, the software location involved in pharmaceutical manufacturing may change. For example, the software that controls execution may still be implemented close to the manufacturing equipment to ensure no impact on performance or security, while other software functions that are not time critical could occur in the cloud (e.g., model updates, control diagnostics, and process monitoring analytics). Third-party data management systems could be used for functions that extend beyond data storage. For example, data stored in these systems may be analyzed by AI to support models for process monitoring and APC.

Data integrity and data quality must be ensured in these environments. While FDA allows the use of third parties for CGMP functions under appropriate oversight by the manufacturer, existing quality agreements between the manufacturer and a third party (e.g., for cloud data management) may have gaps with respect to managing the risks of AI in the context of manufacturing monitoring and control. During inspections, this may lead to challenges in ensuring that the third-party creates and updates AI software with appropriate safeguards for data safety and security.

Discussion Paper: Artificial Intelligence in Drug Manufacturing | 6

Further, FDA inspection approaches for evidence gathering of records management may need to expand due to the complexity of managing third-party cloud data and models. For example, the ongoing interactions between cloud applications and process controls could complicate the ability to establish data traceability, create potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and require evaluation of the procedures in place to monitor data integrity vulnerabilities during an inspection.

### 2. The IOT may increase the amount of data generated during pharmaceutical manufacturing, affecting existing data management practices.
Digitization of manufacturing controls may generate more information about a process and product. The increase in data may be in terms of both the frequency and the types of data recorded. There are regulations and guidance addressing the amount of data and metadata to be stored for each batch of drug product manufactured; however, if the raw data collected during the manufacturing process increases significantly, there may be a need to balance data integrity and retention with the logistics of data management.

Applicants may need clarity regarding regulatory compliance for generated data (e.g., which data needs to be stored and/or reviewed and how loss of these data would impact future quality decisions such as product recalls). Further, applicants may need additional clarity for data sampling rates, data compression, or other data management approaches to ensure that an accurate record of the drug manufacturing process is maintained.

Also, there may be challenges in storing the data in a structured manner that enables retrieval and analysis to support an applicant's decision-making. Moreover, as manufacturing equipment becomes interconnected into a network, maintaining stewardship, privacy, and security of such data generated by the equipment may pose a challenge to preserving product quality or maintaining pharmaceutical manufacturing.

### 4. Applicants may need standards for developing and validating AI models used for process control and to support release testing.
AI can be used in APC applications to control manufacturing processes by adapting process parameters based on real-time data. Additionally, AI models can be used in conjunction with interrogation of in-process material or the final product to: (1) support analytical procedures for in-process or final product testing, (2) support real-time release testing, or (3) predict in-process product quality attributes. There are limited industry standards and FDA guidance available for the development and validation of models that impact product quality, which can create challenges in establishing the credibility of a model for a specific use.

The robustness of the underlying data shapes decisions made by the AI model. This can create challenges in avoiding unintended biases during model development and validation. AI models can also store knowledge gained during development for a specific use case and then apply it to a different but related use case to accelerate model development. Applicants and manufacturers may need clarity regarding how the potential to transfer learning from one AI model to another can be factored into model development and validation.

Discussion Paper: Artificial Intelligence in Drug Manufacturing | 9

As AI methods become more complex, it becomes more challenging to explain how changes in model inputs impact model outputs. In these cases, applicants may be challenged to define standards that validate the model and sustain the explainability¹¹ of the model's output and impact on product quality.

### 5. Continuously learning AI systems that adapt to real-time data may challenge regulatory assessment and oversight.
In the current paradigm, models deployed in manufacturing (e.g., in-process controls, real-time release testing) are developed, validated, implemented, and updated as needed through the change control process within the pharmaceutical quality system. AI models (e.g., machine learning-based models) can involve continuous learning wherein the model evolves over time as new information becomes available.

It may be challenging to determine when an AI model can be considered an established condition of a process. It may also be challenging to determine the criteria for regulatory notification of changes to the model as a part of model maintenance over the product lifecycle. Applicants may need clarity on: (a) the expectations for verification of model lifecycle strategy and the approach for FDA's examination of continuously updated AI control models during a site inspection, and (b) expectations for establishing product comparability after changes to manufacturing conditions introduced by the AI model, especially for biological products.
