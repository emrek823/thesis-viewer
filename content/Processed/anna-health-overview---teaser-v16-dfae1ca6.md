# ANNA Overview

## ANNA Overview

### ANNA
*   Technology-Enabled Multi-Specialty Care
*   Value-Based Bundles
*   Management Services Organization

ANNA (Allied Network for Neurodevelopmental Advancement) is creating the next generation of autism care through 3 pillars:

1.  **Technology-Enabled Multi-Specialty Care:** ANNA delivers the highest quality of autism services, integrating Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI) with technology-driven coordination of diagnosis, speech and language pathology, and occupational therapy for a center-of-excellence approach to care.
2.  **Value-Based Bundles:** ANNA's NDBI model drives improved outcomes with fewer intervention hours than traditional ABA, enabling the delivery of the full multi-specialty center-of-excellence at a discount for families and payors, enabling a risk-based bundle with aligned incentives.
3.  **Management Services Organization:** In addition to productizing clinical protocols and technology, ANNA can productize non-clinical technology (contracting, credentialing, prior authorizations, etc.) to enable independent providers to open home-based franchises with ANNA's high quality clinical and non-clinical infrastructure.

# Market Opportunity

*   **2.0M** Children with Autism
*   **$3.5M** Lifetime Cost / Child
*   **317%** Prevalence Growth Since 2000
*   **80%** White Space in Care Delivery Market

In the United States, there are 2.0 million individuals with autism, which has grown over 10% every year for the past 50 years. At $3.5 million in lifetime costs per individual, **the total cost burden attributable to autism is $7.0 trillion.** This cost burden is largely attributable to 3 major challenges:

1.  **Delayed Diagnosis:** Only 20% of autistic children are diagnosed by age 3 due to 6 - 18+ months waitlists, delaying critical early intervention care.
2.  **Low Quality Care:** Traditional ABA is overly reliant on repetitive, therapist-led care that is not developmentally appropriate and leads to a lack of generalization of skills.
3.  **Fragmentation of Care:** Autism care is not coordinated across key specialties like speech-language pathology and occupational therapy, leading to inefficient utilization and friction for families.
