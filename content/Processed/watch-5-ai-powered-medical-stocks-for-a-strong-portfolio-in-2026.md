The medical sector is one of the major adopters of artificial intelligence (AI), which is currently being used to synthesize new compounds for drugs and create devices for more precise measurement and faster as well as more accurate diagnosis.

AI fundamentally reshaped the medical landscape in 2024, revolutionizing diagnostics, treatment and operational efficiency. AI-powered diagnostics have taken center stage, enhancing accuracy and speed.

The healthcare sector is generally defensive in nature. Most of the stocks are characterized as low-beta and dividend paying. However, extensive use of AI has transformed several of these stocks into potential high-growth providers.

Five such stocks are: Eli Lilly and Co. LLY, Medtronic plc MDT, Intuitive Surgical Inc. ISRG, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. REGN and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.

The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past year.

Eli Lilly and Co.

Eli Lilly boasts a wide range of products that serve a vast number of therapeutic areas. LLY focuses primarily on cardiometabolic health, neuroscience, oncology and immunology, which are all high-growth areas and represent huge commercial potential.

Demand for LLY’s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company’s key top-line drivers. Launches of these drugs in new international markets and improved supply from ramped-up production have led to strong year-to-date sales in 2025.

Eli Lilly’s other new drugs, such as Kisunla, Omvoh and Jaypirca are also contributing to its top-line growth. LLY is also making rapid pipeline progress in obesity and diabetes with an oral GLP-1 obesity pill, orforglipron, expected to be launched next year.

Eli Lilly collaborated with OpenAI to discover novel medicines to assist doctors and other medical professionals. LLY also invested $409 million into Genetic Leap, a biotech company that uses AI models to discover RNA-targeted drugs.

On Oct. 28, 2025, LLY announced that it is building the most powerful supercomputer in the pharmaceutical space, in collaboration with NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA). Management said, “The supercomputer will power an AI factory, a specialized computing infrastructure that manages the entire AI lifecycle from data ingestion and training to fine-tuning and high-volume inference.”

Eli Lilly has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 22.3% and 41.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last 30 days. It has a beta of 0.35 and a current dividend yield of 0.6%.
