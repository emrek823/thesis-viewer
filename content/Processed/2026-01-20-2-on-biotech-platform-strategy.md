For biotech founders and investors, not all types of risk are the same. Opinions vary, but three major buckets of risk are **scientific/technical risk**, **team/execution risk**, and **market risk**. In other words, how likely is it that the technology will *actually* work, does the company have what it takes to make it work, and if it *does* work, will anybody *actually* pay money for it?

In biopharma, the prevailing sentiment is that **scientific/technical risk** is the dominant bucket. We know that markets can be massive—medicines can scale to billions of patients a year with an initial branded monopoly. Teams often have *decades* of experience, frequently having earned terminal degrees for research that made them world experts in their focus area. The looming challenge is that biology is profoundly complex, and clinical trial success rates are in the single digits.

**In reality, market risk in biotech is very real. Differences in business development strategies can lead to dramatically different commercial outcomes, and can even be the deciding factor between success and total failure—especially for platform companies that intend to develop more than one medicine.**

For these companies, there are perennial questions about how to effectively sequence internal pipeline development and external pharmaceutical partnerships, what types of co-development agreements will capture the most value, and even what corporate structure best fits their underlying technology.

Today, we’re joined by [Patrick Malone](https://open.substack.com/users/7593730-patrick-malone?utm_source=mentions), who is a physician-scientist, a talented investor at [KdT Ventures](https://www.kdtvc.com/), a good friend, and the first ever co-author for a *Century of Biology* post. Through deep historical analysis of companies, research for early-stage biotech investments, and countless long conversations, we’ve both tried to develop guiding frameworks for biotech platform strategy.

**Now, we want to share some of those learnings with you.**

Here’s what we’re going to cover:

* A distillation of the key insights from Steven H. Holtzman’s writings on [early-stage biotech value creation](https://leadershipandbiotechnology.blogspot.com/2018/08/early-stage-biotech-value-creation_15.html). First published five years ago, this gem of biotech strategy writing has played an important role in shaping both of our views on platforms and partnerships. Holtzman introduces a useful typology of platforms that provides a valuable foundation for further analysis.
* An updated placement of therapeutics platforms within the broader landscape of biotech business models.
* Re-analyzing biotech dogma that services platform companies eventually become vertically-integrated therapeutics platforms, with some data to suggest that this trend may soon change.

Upfront, we have a caveat. For such a complex and important topic, we have more questions than answers. Rather than pronouncing the discovery of a universal platform playbook, we are open-sourcing the tools and mental models that help us understand the broader evolution of biotech.

We hope this essay adds to your own cognitive toolbox, and serves as the starting point of an important conversation. Please let us know what you don’t understand, what you think we got wrong, and what we’re missing!

With that being said, we’ve got a lot of ground to cover. Let’s jump in! 🧬

## Early-stage biotech value creation

In 2018, biotech veteran Steven Holtzman was deep in the idea maze. As the President and CEO of Decibel Therapeutics—a gene therapy platform company that was ultimately [acquired by Regeneron](https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/regeneron-completes-acquisition-decibel-therapeutics-adding)—he needed to develop a coherent business strategy. To do this effectively, he decided to zoom out and study the broader history of biotech successes and failures.

Thankfully for us, he took things one step further. He shared his “typology” of biotech platforms in an [epic blog post](https://leadershipandbiotechnology.blogspot.com/2018/08/early-stage-biotech-value-creation_15.html) packed with historical and operational insights, “philosophical musings” (courtesy of his previous life as an Oxford-trained philosopher), and strategic ideas—as well as a dialogue with several biotech luminaries about the proposed framework. One observation sits at the core of this post:

**All platforms make multiple products, but not all platforms do it in the same way.**

Obvious, right? But the devil is in the details. Of course different platform companies will use different technologies—that’s not the point here. The key realization is that over the course of biotech history, we’ve used the term “platform” to describe two different types of companies: those with core technologies centered around **new therapeutic modalities** (think antibodies, different RNA medicines, cell therapies), and those focused on **new therapeutics insights** (via genetics/genomics, high-throughput screening, or other new data generation strategies).

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M-sD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40f027ba-dbb0-4a5c-8d2d-640494ef1fc3_681x486.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M-sD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40f027ba-dbb0-4a5c-8d2d-640494ef1fc3_681x486.png)

Let’s start on the far left of this tree. Many companies in biopharma are incorporated to develop and sell a single drug asset (or small handful of drug assets) based on academic results. **While nothing in the business of making drugs is easy, there is a clear playbook for value creation for product companies.**

In the trade-off between raising capital by selling company equity (i.e. dilutive VC funding) and financing development via partnerships (i.e. non-dilutive pharma co-development) in exchange for rights to future profits, the clear choice is to avoid selling away rights to the drug too early. All of the value for the drug candidate—and ultimately the entire company—exists in those future profits. The goal is to sequentially raise equity-based capital at higher valuations based on clinical milestones before the most realistic (and frequent) exit strategy: getting bought by a pharma company for your asset.

All platform companies (the right side of the tree) start on a fundamentally different premise. **Platforms are launched to commercialize biotechnologies that hold the promise to produce** ***multiple*** **products.** Genentech wasn’t founded to commercialize a molecule from an academic lab; it was launched to industrialize recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology. The number of medicines that could be produced based on this single modality is enormous.

Given this potential “embarrassment of riches,” new modality platforms have different strategic considerations for financing compared to pure product companies. In theory, the future value of the company is distributed across *all* of the potential assets. This makes early partnerships—even with worse terms—more appealing. The logic is: “Sure, let’s partner on this first program, there’s more where that came from.”

This dynamic can create a powerful flywheel, giving companies capital to finance more platform development and advance their next assets farther on their own before partnering again. Wash, rinse, repeat. **Ultimately, the endgame for modality platforms is to capture the most possible value by developing an internal pipeline of assets in addition to external partnerships.** (We’ve devoted an entire section to the dynamics at play here—but hang with us for now for the rest of the typology.)

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g5ee!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdaae3086-099f-4593-9e96-767c5bf34ad3_1259x573.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g5ee!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdaae3086-099f-4593-9e96-767c5bf34ad3_1259x573.png)

Okay, what about for platform companies that produce **insights** rather than **modalities**? 

Consider Millennium Pharma, one of the first and most successful genomics platform companies. Millennium didn’t focus on any specific therapeutic modality like rDNA for Genentech. Instead, they used the power of high-throughput genetics and adjacent technologies to produce new disease insights—such as information about molecular pathways and potential drug targets within them.

For a company like Millennium, the partnering logic is similar to that of a modality platform. Unlike a company focused on a single product, it makes more sense to partner early and often to avoid raising dilutive capital. **Millennium did this masterfully.** With only $8.35M of VC dollars, Millennium managed to land several massive partnerships and go public. After a careful sequencing of partnerships and internal asset development, Millennium was ultimately acquired by Takeda for $9B—representing a 100x multiple in the share price from the initial financing.

Awesome! Just land massive partnerships, create internal assets, and profit, right?

There are several major caveats to consider for insights platforms. First, the pharma appetite for your insights is a function of how much of a technological step-change they are. Millennium was building on top of a historical advance, not an incremental improvement. Second, as Holtzman frames it, **“The history of data in the biopharmaceutical industry is the history of its commoditization.”** Just consider the subsequent [price decline in sequencing](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data). Pharma companies make their money from products, and are strongly incentivized to disintermediate any partners who provide them information rather than new drugs. As a result, the transition towards vertical integration (through an internal pipeline) needs to happen much more quickly. 

Finally, not all insights platforms are the same:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M7Jz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a1d835a-7f43-4f1c-a811-38a8318e783c_758x427.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M7Jz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a1d835a-7f43-4f1c-a811-38a8318e783c_758x427.png)

Holtzman further delineates the **insights platform** “genus” into two distinct “species.” First, there are platform companies with a technology that has broad applicability to many different biological pathways and drug targets—like Millennium with genomics. Second, there are platforms with a deep disease-specific focus. One of the most successful examples is [Agios](https://www.agios.com/), which primarily focuses on metabolic insights into cancer.

The narrower the focus for an insights platform, the more its strategy starts to resemble a product-focused company. There are less “shots on goal,” so each one needs to count. As a result, they realistically need to land a sizable multi-target “foundational corporate partnership” earlier on—[like Agios did with Celgene](https://investor.agios.com/news-releases/news-release-details/celgene-corporation-and-agios-pharmaceuticals-announce-global)—and then push even harder to advance their own internal programs.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5XJ1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a54f53-8c08-4f6d-8a1c-ce6e4b66c921_1600x661.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5XJ1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02a54f53-8c08-4f6d-8a1c-ce6e4b66c921_1600x661.png)

This table made by KdT fellow [Emilio Ferrara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilio-ferrara-8225141b5/) should help you fit all of this in your brain.

Okay, that’s the typology. Like all lessons from the field of Strategy, this is more of an overarching model of the different possible paths to value creation than a drag-and-drop playbook. Each success story contains real nuance. As Holtzman framed it in response to a comment from Mark Levin, the CEO of Millennium and a founding partner of Third Rock Ventures, “In reality, using large partnerships to create out-size value requires a keen sense of the external partnering environment, identifying the potential partner(s) which at that specific moment in its/their history has/have come to perceive a critical need for what you have, and crafting deals in which you, while you sell rights, retain the potential for value creation by, for example, retaining ownership of the knowledge. That, not a cookie-cutter model, is your legacy in this arena.”

**Still, it’s worth internalizing the fact that the contours of your technology will dictate your partnering strategy.**
