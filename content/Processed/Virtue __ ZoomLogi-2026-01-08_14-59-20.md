### Product Roadmap & Customer Evolution

- Large fraction of market remains non-sophisticated users
	- Current offering already valuable: centralizing data, control tower functionality, minimal integration
	- 80% of market benefits from foundational layer plus AI enhancements
- Sophisticated player gaps (20% of market):
	- Temperature monitoring, alerting, reporting when issues occur
	- Different SOPs per customer for incident response
- Building no-code workflow piece to digitize and automate SOPs
	- When trigger happens: automated notifications, phone calls, AI summaries
	- Wait periods until response received
- Minaris (CDM/CGT competitor) validated product effectiveness yesterday
- Three product pillars:
- Q1/Q2 launching view-only platform for hospitals/specialty pharma to track incoming shipments
