Global Trends in
R&D 2023
ACTIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY, AND ENABLERS

FEBRUARY
2023

## Introduction

As the global healthcare system re-equilibrates post-pandemic, the biopharmaceutical industry has resumed pre-COVID-19 levels of investment, pipeline activity, and launch of novel medicines following record breaking levels of each in 2020 and 2021. Process and technology innovations that were accelerated by extreme circumstances during the pandemic are being integrated across the global pipeline and implemented as operational and organizational changes that are enabling ongoing productivity gains.

This report assesses the trends in new drug approvals and launches, overall pipeline activity in terms of actively researched medicines, and the number of initiated clinical trials. It also profiles the state of R&D funding and the activity of companies of different types, and the results of research are compared to the input effort in a Clinical Development Productivity Index. This set of analyses reveals important shifts in therapeutic and geographic investments and ongoing prioritization of novel mechanisms of action, innovative development methods and accelerated regulatory pathways to optimize new therapy development and delivery to patients. This work also examines changes in the Productivity Index driven by shifting pipeline complexity and probability of success.

The research included in this report was undertaken independently by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science as a public service, without industry or government funding. The analytics in this report are based on proprietary IQVIA databases and/or third-party information and are not derived from proprietary sponsor trial information.

## Overview

### R&D FUNDING

The past year saw a restoration of pre-pandemic investment flows to life sciences companies in the U.S. after two years of heightened levels during the pandemic. U.S. focused biopharma investments declined 39% from a 2021 high, but at $42.1 billion, 2022 investments remain 25% above the $27.3 billion in 2019. Over the past five years, deal activity has shifted geographically to include more companies headquartered in China and Korea, and fewer Europe-based companies. While North American companies continue to execute the largest number of deals, these declined slightly over the five-year period.

R&D funding from the large pharmaceutical sector remained high with a record $138 billion invested in R&D by the 15 largest pharmaceutical companies in 2022. This represents an increase of 43% since 2017. The number of deals between pharma companies dropped by 25% from 2021 to 2022 with an increase in the share of deals involving emerging biopharma with larger companies.

### R&D PIPELINE

The research and development pipeline remained flat in 2022 with 6,147 products in active development from Phase I to regulatory submission, with growth slowing to 2% over the last two years but maintaining an 8.3% CAGR from 2017-2022.

Oncology remains the focus of the pipeline, comprising 38% or 2,331 products and growing at 10.5% CAGR over the last five years with a recent shift to large-population solid tumor development contributing to the growth. Neurology continues to represent 11% of the pipeline, with research focused on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and increasingly depression and other mental health conditions.

Rare disease focus continues with more than 1,800 molecules targeting one of the growing number of rare disorders for which there are often no or very limited therapeutics available. Half of these focus on oncology, and next-generation biotherapeutics account for at least a quarter of the rare-oncology products, with increased activity in CAR T and NK cell therapies, as well as gene editing and nucleic acid vaccines.

Sources of industry scientific innovation continue to evolve with more than 2,800 companies or organizations currently contributing to the R&D pipeline. China-headquartered companies now account for 15% of the pipeline, up from 4% a decade ago, while Europe's and Japan's shares have fallen to 23% and 6%, respectively. Emerging biopharma companies (EBPs) are responsible for two-thirds of the molecules in the R&D pipeline, up from 51% in 2017 and one-third in 2002. U.S. and China-headquartered companies account for the largest share of the EBP pipeline at 46% and 20% respectively.

### CLINICAL TRIAL ACTIVITY

Clinical trial activity was remarkably resilient even as the pandemic stretched through 2022, with a 1% decline in non-COVID-19 trial starts over 2021 and an increase of 8% over 2019 activity. COVID-19 trials, which surged dramatically in 2020, have dropped to less than half the 2020 level as the severity of the pandemic has subsided. 2022 saw a continued acceleration of mRNA vaccine trial activity led by continued focus on COVID-19 but expanding to meaningful development in multiple other disease areas.

Oncology remains the therapeutic area with the most clinical trial activity in 2022, accounting for 40% of trial starts. Within oncology, rare disease starts have been variably up and down in the past four years, while non-rare oncology has been consistently growing — oncology non-rare represented 44% of the oncology trial starts in 2022, which is the highest relative level in the past 10 years.

Many of the other therapeutic areas showed a slight decrease in clinical trial starts in 2022 versus 2021, but in most cases, remained close to 2019 levels suggesting a re-equilibration to pre-pandemic growth patterns. Exceptions to this include ophthalmology, women's health, and infectious disease where trial starts matched or slightly exceeded 2021 levels. Notably, though neurology dropped slightly, depression trial starts are 68% higher than pre-pandemic with novel mechanisms, including psychedelics, being tested in at least 35% of 2022 trials.

Across completed clinical trials, Black/African American and Hispanic patient representation has declined over the past decade — with Black/African American inclusion dropping 42% in the past two years — and remains below U.S. demographic levels for many therapeutic areas including cardiovascular, endocrinology, neurology, and oncology even in trials with only U.S. sites.

### NEW DRUG APPROVALS AND LAUNCHES

A total of 64 novel active substances (NAS) launched globally in 2022, a decline from the more than 80 launched in each of the prior two years but representing a return to pre-COVID-19 levels. Declines were driven by fewer COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, fewer U.S. accelerated approvals, and fewer NAS launched only in China.

A growing share of new launches in 2022 were first-in-class, reflecting the increasing availability of novel science for patients. 2022 also saw continued growth in number of specialty medicine launches. As new medicines have increasingly targeted areas of high unmet need, clinical trial designs have used single-arm and open label designs and have been used in the approval trials for 43% of launches over the past 5 years.

A total of 353 novel active substances have launched globally in the past 5 years, bringing the 20-year total to 903, with variations in timing of launch and access to these medicines across major geographies. Emerging biopharma companies originated 67% of all new drugs in 2022 and launched 69% of those, indicating more independence on the part of these companies in taking products from innovation to market.

### CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTIVITY

Based on the IQVIA Institute Clinical Development Productivity Index — which provides a composite metric of success rates, clinical trial complexity and trial duration — clinical development productivity increased dramatically in 2022 driven by a decrease in complexity as the pipeline moved away from large COVID-19 focused trials.

Specifically, the complexity metric returned to its pre-pandemic trend following a significant increase largely driven by very high subject enrollment across COVID-19 trials in 2021. The declining number of sites for rare diseases and oncology trials in 2022 is another key driver of the decrease in overall pipeline complexity.

The composite success rate across all therapy areas fell to 6.3% in 2022 while phase II and III success rates rose 2-6%. At the same time, trial durations have increased slightly over the past decade, though oncology and rare diseases trial durations have been declining in recent years, attenuating overarching trial duration increases.

### PRODUCTIVITY ENABLERS

As technology and data innovations take hold across the pharmaceutical development pipeline, productivity is being impacted by a range of trade-off effects on complexity, timing and probability of success.

Scientific complexity continues to increase with first-in-class mechanisms in 62% of the launches spread across nearly all major therapeutic areas in 2022. Likewise, ongoing regulatory shifts are resulting in a rapidly evolving landscape for innovators.

Enablers including novel trial designs and remote, virtual or decentralized trials are playing an increasing role in the recent pipeline. Both advances in trial execution are associated with more subjects, sites, countries, and endpoints suggesting more complex execution, but both are expected to yield decreases in clinical program duration over traditional trials.

Most new drugs in 2022 received expedited reviews with increases in priority and breakthrough designations which, on average, include relatively fewer patients and therefore lower trial complexity. Additionally, the median time from first patent filing to launch for U.S. NAS remained near the lowest levels for the decade in 2022 at 11.2 years, in line with productivity enablers helping to bring industry development timelines down.

Looking forward, less 'mature' enablers are showing increasing potential for impact on clinical development productivity as evidenced by the advance of innovative AI/ML enabled research candidates into the clinical development pipeline.

*   For companies receiving funding, those located in the U.S. rose sharply in 2020 and 2021, while dropping as a share of overall deals as a result of rising levels of funding in Europe, China and other countries.
*   U.S. companies saw funding levels drop by 39% in 2022 compared to the prior year, while still being 25% higher than the 2019 level.
*   European companies saw funding more than double in 2020 from the 2019 level but have seen that drop in the two years since. In 2018 and 2019, European companies received an average of $15.2Bn total funding, while the 2022 level is about half that level at $7.8Bn. The three-year average for 2020-2022 now exceeds $26Bn.
*   Companies based in China saw their share of deals and absolute value jump in 2020 and 2021 and then drop by 59% in 2022 to a level that is 11% below the 2019 level.
*   It remains to be seen if the 2022 share of deals by geography is a correction to unusual trends during the pandemic or a more sustained shift for these key hubs for innovation.

*   North America represents the largest global cluster of life sciences entrepreneurship and as a result includes 57% of deals in 2022, dropping from 62% in 2017. Total deals between companies involving the region dropped by 355 or 13% over the five-year period.
*   Since 2017, the level of deal activity has shifted considerably, with rising activity from companies headquartered in South Korea and China.
*   There were 387 total deals in China in 2022, up 33% from five years earlier, reflecting a significant increase in the level of interest in the innovations from these companies and many including high profile large pharma collaborations or licensing deals, and the near-term expectation that some of these medicines will be approved in the U.S. and other major developed markets.
*   The increasing deal volume with South Korean companies is greater than with Chinese companies, growing from 251 five years ago to 490 in 2022, but involving a greater share of licensing and collaborative R&D deals building on the established biologic and biomarker capabilities of key companies along with well placed regional capacity for manufacturing, including biosimilars.
*   Deals involving European companies dropped by 163 or 9%, while share of activity dropped from 41% to 39% as the rate of activity failed to keep pace with the increases from the more active Asian companies.

Notes: Deals by company headquarter location between pharma companies and are not mutually exclusive. Total deals include double-counts of deals where participants are in different regions. Excludes venture capital and funding deals. Funding deals are defined as those which include grants and awards from governments, etc.

*   Overall, there was a decrease in activity across all deal types in 2022, driven by hesitancy toward dealmaking related to geopolitical tensions, drug pricing and macro-economic issues (fluctuating valuations, inflation).
*   Publicly disclosed life sciences deal activity reveals that the number of agreements signed in 2022, excluding standalone research grants, was approximately 1.5% above the 2019 level and 16.5% lower than 2021.
*   In 2021 there were 519 COVID-19-related deals, dropping to 286 in 2022 as there were fewer perceived new opportunities in either vaccines or therapeutics.
*   While the rising number of deals was driven by COVID-19 in 2020 through 2022, the 4,339 non-COVID-19 deals in 2021, were 9% higher than 2019, and the 3,770 non-COVID-19 deals in 2022 was 6% lower than 2019, reflecting a return to previous trends.
*   General market volatility and prospect of increased regulatory scrutiny led to a significant cooling of appetite for M&A deals.
*   The M&A process had initially been reported to be hindered by a lack of face-to face contact, particularly for larger deals, which resulted in delays but did not stop the signing of new deals. Much of the industry had returned to in-person meetings at many conferences in 2022.
*   There were 483 M&A deals announced in 2022, down from 615 in 2021 (defined here as Mergers, Business Acquisitions and Divestments, signed but not necessarily completed) but matching the number in 2018.

*   The largest pharmaceutical companies together spent more than $138Bn on research and development in 2022, up 1.7% from 2021.
*   Across these companies, R&D dropped to 18.8% of revenue in 2022 after four years above 19% but remains at historically high levels.
*   Global revenue for these 15 companies totaled $737Bn in 2022, up from $704Bn in 2021, a 4.7% increase in net sales.
*   The reduction in R&D % of revenue in 2022 is attributed to fewer companies having major write-offs from failed R&D programs, and some large companies having a major increase in sales related to COVID-19 vaccines or therapeutics while their R&D spending also increased, but at a slower rate.
*   Since 2017, R&D spending for large companies has increased by 43% with a five-year CAGR of 7.4%.
*   R&D expenses can include write-offs of failed R&D programs developed internally or acquired, which can bring year-to-year variability in the level of total spending.

*   Emerging biopharma companies - defined as those with less than $200Mn in R&D spending and less than $500Mn per year in annual sales - have expanded their involvement in deals steadily over the past five years.
*   In 2017, large and-mid-sized companies — those with more than $5Bn in global sales — were involved in 46% of deals that involved other large and mid-sized or emerging companies; while that level of deals has remained steady, as a share of the company deal activity, it has dropped to 42%.
*   The shifts in activity over the past five years have meant that 90% of all deal activity between these types of companies involves an emerging company, up from 84% five years ago, even as the activity between emerging companies without a larger firm now represent 57% of deals, up from 53% five years ago.
*   The rising independence of emerging biopharma companies in recent years, shifted in 2022 as deals involving larger companies jumped from 27% in 2021 to 33% in 2022.
*   Even so, novel drugs developed by emerging biopharma are also being launched by them more often, with 69% of the 26 EBP-originated NAS launches in the U.S. in 2022 also being launched by an EBP (Exhibit 31).

Notes: Deals in this analysis exclude funding deals. Funding deals are deals that involve research grants or funding from government institutions, government bodies, universities or other academic institutions. Excludes VC and funding grants from non-commercial.

## R&D pipeline

*   The research and development pipeline remained flat in 2022, with 6,147 products in active development from Phase I to regulatory submission, growing 2% over the last two years, but 49% since 2017.
*   The clinical development pipeline for non-rare cancers grew 7% in 2022, however development for rare cancers has plateaued or declined slightly since 2020, which may reflect the beginning of a shift away from rare cancers by pharmaceutical companies.
*   Oncology development is focused more on solid tumors, with 5% growth over the last year, while development of drugs for hematological cancers declined 4% in 2022.
*   Neurology research is focused on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, with depression and other mental health conditions becoming increasingly more important.
*   The focus on rare diseases — beyond rare cancers — is reflected in the R&D pipeline, which includes more than 900 molecules targeting one of the growing number of rare disorders for which there are often no or very limited therapeutics available.
*   More than 900 next-generation biotherapeutics are now in the R&D pipeline, with increased activity in CAR T and NK cell therapies as well as gene editing and nucleic acid vaccines. More than 40% of next-generation biotherapeutics in development in 2022 were for oncology, bringing great promise for cancer treatment.
*   More than 2,800 companies or organizations currently contribute to the R&D pipeline. China-headquartered companies now account for 15% of the pipeline, up from 4% a decade ago, while Europe and Japan's shares have fallen to 23% and 6%, respectively.
*   Emerging biopharma companies (EBPs) — defined as those with R&D spending less than $200Mn per year and less than $500Mn in annual sales — are responsible for two-thirds of the molecules in the R&D pipeline, up from 51% in 2017 and one-third in 2002.
*   Emerging biopharma drug development is rising rapidly, particularly in China-headquartered companies, whose share now exceeds that of Europe. U.S.-headquartered companies represent nearly half of EBP development, while Europe and Japan have seen declining shares of the EBP pipeline over the last decade.

The research and development pipeline remained flat in 2022 with ongoing oncology focus and continued share gain in rare, next-generation, Chinese and EBP segments of the pipeline.

*   The research and development pipeline remained flat in 2022, with 6,147 products in active development from Phase I to regulatory submission, growing 2% over the last two years and 49% since 2017.
*   This slowing growth since the pandemic began is likely due to delays in development activity as COVID-19 and new variants have caused a series of disruptions to society since 2020.
*   Oncology remains the focus of the pipeline, comprising 38% or 2,331 products and growing at 10.5% CAGR over the last five years.
*   Neurology continues to represent 11% of the pipeline, with growth in the number of products in development to 699 following a modest decline in 2021.
*   The therapy area with the highest CAGR since 2017 is eye and ear conditions (20.7%), which is predominantly focused on ocular anti-neovascularization products and treatments for rare eye conditions.
*   Vaccines have the second-highest CAGR since 2017 (14.1%), with a heavy focus on COVID-19 vaccines and influenza in recent years.
*   Products in development for gastrointestinal disorders account for 7% of the pipeline, growing 9.9% CAGR over the last five years. There has been an increased focus on rare gastrointestinal conditions and liver disease.

Notes: Includes drugs with an active research program, with phase determined by the highest phase of research regardless of indication. Oncology includes supportive care. Neurology includes central nervous system disorder treatments and mental health treatments but does not include pain management or anesthesia.

*   The clinical development pipeline for non-rare cancers grew 7% in 2022, however development for rare cancers has plateaued or declined slightly since 2020, which may reflect the beginning of a shift away from rare cancers by pharmaceutical companies.
*   In 2022, 39% of the oncology pipeline was under development for rare cancers, down from 41% in 2021 and 46% five years ago.
*   Targeted small molecule and biotech therapies continue to grow in development for non-rare cancers but have seen limited growth and even declines in rare cancers. These include many of the new immuno-oncology treatments, checkpoint inhibitors, and kinase inhibitors.
*   Although next-generation biotherapeutics represent a smaller share of the total oncology pipeline, these cell, gene, and RNA therapies provide promising tools for more precision in cancer treatment, particularly in rare cancers where one-quarter of products under development are next-generation.
*   As many of these targeted or next-generation treatments relate to genetic mutations or other biomarkers, the use of companion diagnostics is likely to become more prevalent to provide more precise and effective treatment in cancer patients.

Notes: Analysis includes medicines in active research with a focus on cancer therapeutics including supportive care. Medicines are considered targeted if their mechanism of action uses a specific biomarker to target treatment within the body. Many cancer drugs have multiple tumors in research, and drugs which have any trials focused on rare cancers have been included as rare. Drugs which have no rare tumor targets are considered non-rare. All other includes a range of cytotoxic, hormonal, and radiotherapeutic mechanisms without a targeting mechanism.

*   Oncology research and development has seen an increasing focus on targeted drugs, with innovative mechanisms of action for treatment of cancers over the last decade.
*   While development of drugs for hematological cancers declined 4% in 2022, clinical development for solid tumor cancers grew 5% following a slight contraction in the pipeline in 2021.
*   Next-generation biotherapeutics are increasingly under investigation for hematological cancers, with the number of products currently in active research more than four times what it was in 2017 and accounting for 28% of the hematological-oncology pipeline.
*   Immuno-oncologics, which saw significant growth over the last decade, have begun to taper off in recent years, with declines in hematological cancers beginning in 2018 and in 2019 for solid tumors, potentially indicating a switch to even newer targeted molecules.
*   Despite being first developed in the 1960s, bispecific antibody development for cancer treatment was minimal a decade ago and has grown significantly, now representing 7% of both the hematological-oncology and solid tumor pipelines, indicating an increasing focus on the ability of these molecules to act on multiple targets or through different mechanisms of action.
*   Many new antibody-drug conjugates have been under development in oncology in the last decade, allowing for targeting cytotoxic agents directly to cancer cells, improving on the non-specificity of older oncology products.

Notes: Other includes non-targeted mechanisms within categories of cytotoxics, hormonal, and radiotherapeutics. Products being investigated for more than one type of cancer may be included in both hematological and solid tumor cancers.

*   Currently, there are 1,824 products (30% of pipeline) under development for rare diseases, with half of these for diseases outside of oncology.
*   Phase II makes up a significant portion of the pipeline, reflective of significant numbers of hybrid Phase I/II trials underway with difficult to identify patients, extending their trial durations and contributing to potentially different clinical development journeys for these products.
*   Products in development for rare neurological disorders represent the largest share of the rare disease pipeline after rare oncology, accounting for 22%; however, this share declines in later phases and has remained stable over time, indicating difficulties in achieving success in earlier phases for these products.
*   Across phases, drug development for rare gastrointestinal conditions has been increasing now accounting for 16% of rare drug development. Nearly half of the rare gastrointestinal pipeline is for treating inherited rare disorders such as lysosomal storage disorders, mucopolysaccharidosis, and Pompe disease, with a high number of gene therapies and other next-generation biotherapeutics to address the underlying genetic modifications for these disorders.

Notes: Includes drugs with an active research program, with phase determined by the highest phase of research regardless of indication. Many drugs have ongoing research for multiple indications, and drugs which have any trials focused on rare diseases have been included as rare. Analysis excludes oncology.

*   In 2022, 960 next-generation biotherapeutics were in development from Phase I through filing with a regulatory agency. The next-generation biotherapeutic pipeline has grown significantly in recent years, with a 20% CAGR since 2017.
*   Cell therapies represent the largest share of the next-generation biotherapeutic pipeline with 40% of these being investigated for a range of cancers, predominantly non-rare solid tumor malignancies.
*   Gene therapies, including gene editing technologies such as CRISPR, have had moderate growth in recent years following a period of deceleration in the early-2010s. 26% of these are focused on gastrointestinal conditions and eye and ear conditions representing another 16%.
*   Even though they were not in development prior to 2012, there are now 217 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) and natural killer (NK) cell therapies in development, representing the second highest share of the next-generation biotherapeutic pipeline, with nearly all in development for cancer.
*   RNA-based therapeutics, including RNA interference (RNAi) — the inhibition of expression of certain genes by mRNA — continue to represent a small share of the next-generation biotherapeutic pipeline.
*   RNA and DNA vaccines have become increasingly investigated since the COVID-19 pandemic across a range of cancers and infectious diseases (Exhibit 21).

*   Next-generation are defined as cell therapies, gene therapies, gene editing, nucleotide and RNA interference, mRNA therapies and RNA or DNA vaccines.
*   Oncology continues to comprise the bulk of next-generation biotherapeutic development (42%), however other disease areas, such as gastrointestinal conditions and neurological disorders, continue to see increasing activity.
*   Next-generation vaccines have seen a substantial increase in the last two years, driven by the pandemic's acceleration of mRNA and DNA vaccine technology development. Although COVID-19 remains the focus of these nucleic acid vaccines, these are now being tested for other diseases (Exhibit 21).

Notes: Includes drugs with an active research program, with phase determined by the highest phase of research regardless of indication.

*   Currently, more than 2,700 companies and more than 100 academic or research groups around the world are involved in the R&D pipeline.
*   The U.S. share of the global R&D pipeline has remained relatively stable, at above 40% over the past 15 years.
*   Europe's share has declined from 31% to 23% over the past 15 years, while the absolute number of active programs grew by 25% — from 1,327 to 1,655.
*   Companies headquartered in Japan have seen a declining share of the pipeline, dropping to 6% in 2022, down from 10% five years ago, and a 26% drop in absolute number of active programs since 2017.
*   Products from China-headquartered companies now represent 15% of the R&D pipeline, up from 6% five years ago and 2% in 2007. The active pipeline from China-headquartered companies has more than tripled in the last five years, reflecting recent significant investments made in the life sciences there.
*   South Korea's share of the pipeline has remained relatively stable despite 92% growth in the absolute number of active programs over the last five years.

*   The contribution of emerging biopharma companies — those with less than $500Mn in annual sales and R&D spending less than $200Mn per year — continues to increase, while large pharma companies — those with greater than $10Bn in annual sales — represent an increasingly smaller share of the R&D pipeline.
*   While emerging biopharma companies were responsible for only one-third of innovation in 2002, they now are responsible for two-thirds of the R&D pipeline, highlighting the increasing importance of innovation from these smaller companies.
*   While the number of larger companies actively involved in the R&D pipeline has remained stable since 2017, the number of emerging biopharma companies has grown 26%.
*   Large pharma companies now represent just 23% of pipeline activity, down from 48% in 2002, while the absolute number of actively researched drugs rose from 956 to 1,090 for companies of this size.
*   Although a small contributor to the clinical pipeline (<1%), academic and research groups play an important role in the R&D pipeline, particularly in advancing work in discovery and pre-clinical phases prior to clinical investigation.

*   Emerging biopharma company R&D activity is spread out across major geographies, with more than 4,500 products under development by emerging biopharma companies.
*   The emerging biopharma pipeline grew 7% in 2022, following a slight plateau in 2021 due to the pandemic, bringing total growth since 2017 to 82%.
*   China-headquartered companies now represent 20% of the global emerging biopharma pipeline, up from 9% just five years ago and higher than China's share of the overall pipeline. Growth in the emerging biopharma pipeline was strongest in China compared to other geographies, with 19% growth in the past year.
*   The U.S. continues to represent nearly half of the emerging biopharma pipeline, although this share has declined slightly in recent years from a peak of 50% in 2016 to 46% in 2022.
*   Europe and Japan represent smaller shares of the emerging biopharma pipeline than they do the overall pipeline, with shares declining since 2012 as innovation has increased in China and South Korea. Europe and Japan saw declines of 5% and 20%, respectively, in the emerging biopharma pipeline over the last year.

*   COVID-19 trial starts accounted for 10% and 6% of the total in 2021 and 2022 respectively.
*   Planned non-COVID-19 Phase II and III trials declined by 2% from 2021, and Phase I declined by 1% while still exceeding pre-pandemic levels of trial starts.
*   The double digit increases in planned trial starts in 2021 were related to 2020 trial delays driven by COVID-19 disruptions, and while activity has returned to a more normal trend, not all planned trials reported for 2021 will have started by the end of the year and, accordingly, trial start trends in recent years should be interpreted with caution.

Notes: Phase II includes Phases I/II, II, IIa, IIb. Phase III includes Phase II/III and III. Terminated trials are included to track the activity still involved with their initiation, partial execution and termination. Trials were industry sponsored, interventional trials and device trials were excluded.

*   Infectious disease trials showed a dip in non-COVID-19 starts in early 2020, concurrent with the appearance of the first COVID-19 trials.
*   By mid-2020, a surge in trial starts had COVID-19-related trials nearly tripling those of infectious disease trial starts.
*   New COVID-19 trials have dropped to less than half the level in 2020 as fewer new targets have been identified.
*   Overall, non-COVID-19 infectious disease trial activity has focused on therapeutics to a greater degree than vaccines.
*   While there has been some overlap in the areas of focus, the relative priority for vaccines has remained on flu and pneumococcal trials, while therapeutics have focused on bacterial infections, HIV and hepatitis.
*   Bacterial infections represent 21% of infectious disease trial starts in the last year, notable considering the continued lack of novel mechanisms and targets and the growing risks of antimicrobial resistance.

*   The last four years have seen record-breaking numbers of subjects planned or enrolled in clinical trials, with the number approaching 4 million in 2021, and still an exceptional 1.9 million in 2022.
*   The largest area of increase in study subjects has been infectious diseases, and even excluding COVID-19 and Ebola, other infectious diseases had nearly 600,000 subjects in 2022 compared to 125,000 in 2018.
*   In addition to the 1 million COVID-19 subjects in 2020, studies enrolled another 2.4 million in 2021 and more than 330,000 in 2022.
*   Oncology trials accounted for 16% of the industry's clinical trial subjects in 2022, with 289,000 subjects, down by 9,000 subjects but up from 8% of all trial subjects in 2021.
*   As the COVID-19 vaccine trial surge recedes, the industry has an opportunity to keep the large set of recent trial subjects engaged for participation in ongoing and future clinical research.
*   The number of subjects in trials is generally trending down as more trials focus on niche populations, although this has been reversed with some large population trials for infectious diseases, as well as cardiovascular and other metabolic trials (Exhibit 39).

Notes: Subjects are the reported target or actual patients reported for trials with planned or actual start dates in each year.

*   Clinical testing of mRNA vaccines has dramatically increased since 2016 with a more than 30-fold increase in the number of candidates by 2022.
*   Starting in 2020, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines accounted for a significant portion of this growth and increased from 5 candidates beginning in 2020 to 26 in 2022.
*   The increased focus on mRNA vaccines as a result of COVID-19 vaccine development seems to have boosted other development with non-COVID-19 mRNA candidate development increasing 12-fold in the last five years.
*   mRNA vaccine development for flu and respiratory infections was the highest non-COVID-19 segment in 2022, representing 35% of the development activity.
*   Despite making up the largest proportion of the pre-COVID-19 mRNA pipeline, oncology focused mRNA vaccines have not drastically increased and make up 8% of the pipeline in 2022.

*   Oncology and rare disease remain the two most active, though overlapping, therapeutic areas for trial starts in 2022, making up 40% and 33% of trial starts respectively in 2022.
*   Though both areas have shown steady increases in trial starts for most of the past decade, rare disease and oncology rare both show a dip in 2022 as a function of their heavy overlap.
*   Within oncology, rare disease starts have been variably up and down in the past four years, while non-rare oncology has been consistently growing - oncology non-rare represented 44% of the oncology trial starts in 2022, which is the highest relative level in at least the past 10 years.
*   The number of solid tumor trial starts has been growing steeply across the decade, although they remained stable in 2022; hematological trial starts have grown more slowly over the past 10 years.
*   Predictive biomarker use has been increasing steadily over the past 10 years as well, and now includes at least three-quarters of the oncology pipeline, and much like the rest of the oncology pipeline, saw no growth in 2022.

Notes: Phase II includes Phases I/II, II, IIa, IIb. Phase III includes Phase II/III and III. Terminated trials are included to track the activity still involved with their initiation, partial execution and termination. Trials were industry sponsored, interventional trials and device trials were excluded. Oncology has been segmented into hematological or solid tumor in two charts, and into those with predictive biomarker and without biomarkers in two charts. Each pair of charts totals overall oncology.

*   Many of the key non-oncology therapeutic areas showed a very slight decrease in clinical trial starts in 2022 versus 2019, but in many cases, still remained above 2020 levels, suggesting a return to pre-pandemic growth patterns.
*   Exceptions to this include ophthalmology, infectious disease and women's health, where trial starts matched or slightly exceeded 2021 levels.
*   Both NASH and respiratory show a slightly steeper decline, with respiratory continuing a decline started in 2020, and NASH total trial starts dropping by 37% between 2021 and 2022.

*   Overall depression trial starts have increased by 35% in the past five years and have seen a particularly sharp rise since 2020.
*   Major depressive disorder remains the most active segment, with more than 90% of 2022 trial starts.
*   Activity around other key depression segments include minor increases in the last three years, but these still account for a small portion of the trial starts in 2022, with treatment resistant depression a focus in 23%, postpartum depression in 3%, and pediatric and adolescent depression in 3% of trial starts.
*   In addition to top line segments, depression trials are focused on patients with a broad variety of co-morbidities and depression types (not shown).
*   Notably, despite significant publicity, COVID-19 associated depression starts only accounted for 2% of the trial pipeline in 2022.
*   As researchers and clinicians navigate a complex matrix of depression phenotypes across patients, the focus on mechanisms of action is becoming more targeted and hypothesis-driven.²
*   Analysis of depression drug mechanisms of action paints a very complex picture with a variety of emerging novel mechanisms entering clinical testing, including novel serotonin reuptake inhibitors, neurotropic steroids, serotonergic psychedelics and NMDA psychedelics, which together account for 36% of the 2022 trial pipeline.
*   Despite psychedelics now representing 24% of the trial starts in 2022, their potential role is evolving as sponsors and regulators will need to negotiate highly intensive regulatory and administration burden and unique uncertainties related to these controlled substances both in later stage clinical trials and in clinical practice.

Notes: Trials may focus on more than one segment and depression segment analysis includes some double counting as a result. Additionally, segment assignment depends on reporting in the data source, and secondary depression segmentation may be under counted in the data set.

*   Despite increasing sponsor focus on diversity in clinical trials and diversity data reporting, and recent FDA guidance on diversity data reporting and clinical program diversity planning, Black/African American and Hispanic patient inclusion failed to reach U.S. demographic levels on average across interventional trials, including U.S. sites in the past decade.³,⁴,⁵
*   Black/African American participation has been declining over the past decade, with an inclusiveness drop most notable in the past five years, with a 46% decline in U.S. Census indexed inclusion between 2018 and 2022 — from 81% of US demographics to 43%.
*   Hispanic inclusiveness has varied over the past decade and does not show as distinct a decline as Black/African American inclusion, but also never reached U.S. demographic levels in the past decade. Hispanic patients were enrolled in trials at 53% of U.S. demographic levels in 2022.
*   Black/African American and Hispanic patients are critically under-represented in trials using U.S. clinical sites and seeking U.S. regulatory approval and are indicative of broader clinical development diversity opportunities to address ongoing healthcare disparities and expected ongoing regulatory and legislative requirements.³,⁴,⁵

Notes: Includes all interventional Phase II and III trials with industry involvement and any U.S. sites listed on ClinicalTrials.gov starting after 2009 and completing between the start of 2012 and the end of 2022.

*   While Black/African American and Hispanic inclusion varied across therapeutic areas, both were higher across all therapeutic areas in trials which were recruited exclusively in the U.S., and both saw lowest levels of inclusion in oncology.
*   Specifically, Black/African American inclusion in therapeutic and geographic subsets ranged from 34% (2.5 times higher than U.S. demographic) of patients in U.S.-site-only psychiatry trials run between 2020 and 2022 to 3% (20% of the U.S. demographic levels) of globally run oncology trials in the same time period.
*   Similarly, Hispanic inclusion ranged from 44% (2.3 times higher than the U.S. Hispanic demographic) in U.S. run hepatology studies to 6% (31% of U.S. demographic) of globally run oncology trials.
*   Notably, even in U.S.-site-only trials, Black/African American and Hispanic inclusion in oncology only reached 51% and 35% of the U.S. demographic levels respectively.
*   Given the significant proportion of the industry trial pipeline made up by oncology, averaging 38% over the past five years, the impact of poor inclusivity in oncology trials is driving the industry average inclusivity down across the timeframe.
*   The dramatic inclusivity disparities in the largest clinical development segment mirrors some of the starkest healthcare disparities in the U.S. and provides directed improvement opportunities that can impact the entire pipeline and healthcare outcomes at large.⁶,⁷

## New drug approvals and launches

*   A total 64 novel active substances (NASs) launched globally in 2022, a decline from the more than 80 launched in each of the prior two years but representing a return to pre-COVID-19 levels of NAS launches.
*   Declines in global NAS launches in 2022 were driven by fewer COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics as the pandemic's effects on society lessened, there were fewer U.S. accelerated approvals, and fewer NASs were launched only in China.
*   A growing share of new launches in 2022 were first-in-class, reflecting the increasing availability of novel science for patients. Additionally, new launches are increasingly specialty products due to the growing number of complex molecules launched that often require advanced distribution and management systems to deliver them to patients.
*   Since the first next-generation biotherapeutic launched in 1998, 42 next-generation biotherapeutics — including cell, gene and RNA therapies — have launched globally, with 19 occurring in the last three years and six of the 39 U.S. NAS launches in 2022, including two cell therapies, two gene therapies, and two RNAi therapies.
*   Emerging biopharma companies originated 67% of all new drugs in 2022 and launched 69% of those, indicating more independence on the part of EBP companies in taking products from innovation to market.
*   A total of 353 novel active substances have launched globally in the past 5 years, bringing the 20-year total to 903, with variations in timing of launch and access to these medicines across major geographies.

The number of global novel actives substances launched dropped by nearly a third in 2022 but still exceeded all pre-COVID-19 years and included a higher percentage of first-in-class drugs driving increased availability of novel science for patients.

*   A total 64 novel active substances (NASs) launched globally in 2022, a decline from the more than 80 launched in each of the prior two years but representing a return to pre-COVID-19 levels.
*   Oncology, neurology, and immunology have had rising shares of new launches in the past five years, with 173 of the 353 launches (49%) compared to 95 of 232 (41%) from 2013 to 2017.
*   Infectious diseases, including COVID-19 as well as anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic treatments, have included novel treatments for HIV, Ebola, and more recently monkeypox, and are 16% of NAS launches over the last decade, with some year-to-year variability.
*   The total 184 oncology launches in the past decade include some of the most groundbreaking new treatments in immuno-oncology as well as next-generation biotherapeutics, and many treatments for rare cancers.
*   Neurology includes 58 drugs in 10 years, and many of the more recent launches are for rare neuromuscular diseases as well as the new CGRP mechanism for migraine treatment, the first new mechanism for migraines in decades.
*   The first next-generation biotherapeutic, an antisense oligonucleotide to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis, was launched globally in 1998. Since then, 42 next-generation biotherapeutics — including cell, gene and RNA therapies — have launched globally, with 19 occurring in the last three years.

Notes: A novel active substance (NAS) is a new molecular or biologic entity or combination where at least one element is new. Includes NASs launched anywhere in the world by year of first global launch. Launch is determined using IQVIA audits of sales activity as well as companies' public statements. Oncology includes supportive care & diagnostics. COVID-19 includes novel medicines only, and does not include previously approved medicines with new approved uses for COVID-19.

*   The 64 NASs launched globally in 2022 was a significant drop from the 93 launched globally in 2021, which was a record year and included a variety of unique launches.
*   A small drop in the number of NASs can be attributed to a decline in the number of novel COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines, a result of the declining impact of the pandemic on society and a shift away from COVID-19 pharmaceutical development.
*   Across applications for new drugs and biologics and supplemental applications, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 25 through accelerated approvals in 2021 and dropped to less than half that in 2022. Of the global NAS launches between 2021 and 2022, a decline of 8 can be attributed to fewer U.S. accelerated approvals which represents a return to 2019 levels.
*   China has seen an increasing number of NASs launched only domestically and not in other major markets. The number of NASs launched in China only had remained low in previous years (5-6) but increased to a peak of 21 in 2021 and fell back to 10 in 2022, more consistent with historic levels.

Notes: Segmentations are non-overlapping and all COVID-19 NAS are grouped regardless of other characteristics. China only NAS are those only launched in China and not in other major markets.

*   Over the past five years, a significant number of first-in-class medicines have become available, rising to 62% of those launched in 2022 and averaging 46% for the last five years.
*   Over the past five years, 143 drugs launched with orphan drug designations, representing 53% of the 268 launches, indicating a significant focus of innovative medicines for rare diseases.
*   Specialty medicines — those which treat chronic, complex or rare diseases and which also have complex treatment, distribution or patient management aspects, along with often high costs, made up 85% of the launches in the U.S. in 2022 with only six of the 39 2022 launches being traditional medicines.
*   Unsurprisingly, this increase in specialty medicines in 2022 coincides with an increase in NAS that are biologics (59%) and a decrease in those that are oral administered (31%), as biologic medications and those provided by injection or infusion frequently result in more complex distribution and patient management as well as higher costs.
*   As new medicines have increasingly targeted areas of high unmet need, clinical trial designs have used single-arm and open label designs, common in areas where it is less feasible or practical to conduct a more traditional randomized placebo-controlled trial. Open-label trials were used in the approval trials for 43% of launches over the past five years.

Notes: Includes NASs launched in the United States 2018-2022 regardless of the timing of FDA approval. Orphans include drugs with one or more orphan indications approved by the FDA at product launch. Products are not reclassified as orphan if they subsequently receive an approval for an orphan designated indication. First-in-class is based on FDA classification. Predictive biomarkers and companion diagnostics based on FDA approval information. Open label and single arm are clinical trial attributes determined based on the trial designs of trials noted by FDA being relevant for the approval.

*   The number of novel active substances (NASs) originated by EBP companies that have launched has doubled in the last five years, with 26 NASs launched in 2022 that originated from an EBP company.
*   Although the share of NASs launched that are EBP originated varies significantly from year-to-year, EBP companies have originated 62% of U.S. NAS launches over the past five years, up from 49% over the previous five years and indicating increased EBP innovation reaching the market.
*   Products originated by EBPs are increasingly launched by an EBP company, indicating more independence on the part of EBP companies in taking products from innovation to market.
*   EBP companies launched 69% of their own products in 2022, with 18 EBP originated and launched NASs. This was the largest share of total NASs that were EBP originated and launched (46%) over the last decade (average = 33%).

Notes: NAS Launches in the U.S. have been segmented by the originator, which is based on the company which filed the first patent. The segmentation laid out in exhibit 1 is applied based on the revenue or R&D spend at the time of the patent filing. Launch company segmentation has been assessed by the FDA filing company, further verified by the status of that company in relation to acquisitions by other companies as often filing company does not change retroactively to reflect new ownership.

*   A total of 64 novel active substances have launched for the first time globally in 2022, bringing the five-year total to 353. Based on molecules in the late-stage pipeline, over the next five years an average of 60 NASs are expected to launch annually, expanding the number of NASs launched globally by 300 in the next five years.
*   U.S. launches totaled 39 in 2022, the fewest NAS launches in a single year in the U.S. since 2016, likely reflecting delayed impacts of the pandemic, however still totaling a high of 268 in the last five years.
*   The four largest EU member countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain) and the UK saw a similar number of NAS launches to the U.S. in 2022 at 38, below a record number in 2021 of 50 launches; however, the 192 over the past five years lags 76 behind the U.S.
*   Japan had 31 NAS launches in 2022, the fifth consecutive year with 30 or more launches, and although launching sooner after global launch than earlier in the century, continuing to lag behind the U.S. and other major markets.
*   China's 29 confirmed NAS launches brings the five-year total to 193, with numbers driven by regulatory acceleration mechanisms, such as policies to expedite development and review and reimbursement reforms, all supporting a growing domestic innovation ecosystem and encouraging earlier entry by multi-nationals.

Notes: Novel active substance (NASs) is defined as a medicine with at least one novel ingredient and is noted in the year it launches for the first time in the relevant geography. Fixed-dose combinations are NASs if one of the ingredients is novel but are not if both are previously available. Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) are counted as NASs in the year the medicine became available to patients and no exclusion is applied for approval type. COVID-19 vaccines are counted as NASs based on the technology used to create them, with those made by mRNA technology counted as one NAS, and those made by each of eight sub-types of COVID-19 vaccines considered one NAS each, five types have launched to date with three more in development.

## Clinical development productivity

*   A Clinical Development Productivity Index provides a composite metric of success rates, clinical trial complexity, and trial duration.
*   Clinical development productivity increased dramatically in 2022 driven by a decrease in complexity.
*   The composite success rate across all therapy areas fell to 6.3% in 2022 while Phase II and III success rates rose 2-6%.
*   Across disease areas, 2022's composite success rate was below the 10-year trend with the exception of vaccines.
*   Probability of success varies considerably across diseases, with infectious diseases and dermatology highest.
*   Clinical trial complexity declined in 2022, following a significant increase in 2021 due to large COVID-19 trials.
*   The declining number of sites for rare diseases and oncology trials is a key driver of the decrease in overall pipeline complexity.
*   Trial durations have increased slightly over the past decade and Phase III, in particular, has been a driver in recent years.
*   Oncology and rare diseases trial durations have been declining in recent years, attenuating overarching trial duration increases.
*   The composite Clinical Development Productivity Index saw an increase in 2022 after steadily declining since 2015.
*   Clinical development productivity indices were highest for infectious diseases while oncology extends trend as lowest.

### CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTIVITY

A Clinical Development Productivity Index provides a composite metric of success rates, clinical trial complexity, and trial duration

**Exhibit 33: Clinical Development Productivity Index (Diagram Description)**

The IQVIA Clinical Development Productivity Index is a composite metric defined by the formula:
**Productivity = Success / (Complexity x Duration)**

**Elements of the Index:**

*   **SUCCESS:**
    *   Measured by: Success rate (derived from Trial output).

*   **EFFORT:**
    *   Composed of two main factors:
        *   **Complexity:**
            *   Measured by:
                *   Number of subjects
                *   Eligibility criteria
                *   Trial sites
                *   Endpoints
                *   Countries
        *   **Duration:**
            *   Measured by: Duration of trial (derived from Trial inputs).

Source: IQVIA Institute, Jan 2023.

*   The productivity of the clinical development process can be considered as a measure of trial outputs (drugs, innovation, trial success, etc.), compared to a measure of trial inputs or resources dedicated to obtaining those outputs (e.g., aspects of trial complexity, duration, monetary investments, etc.). Such measures of success, complexity, and trial duration were selected for inclusion in the Productivity Index as described above.
*   Increases in success will increase productivity overall as will decreases in complexity or duration. Conversely, decreases in success will drive down the Productivity Index, as do increases in complexity and duration.
*   To obtain current-state measures of trial complexity (mean number of endpoints, sites, countries, patients, eligibility criteria) as well as data on trial duration, attributes were leveraged from the Citeline Trialtrove clinical trial database. In order to determine the number of eligibility criteria and endpoints from the unstructured or semi-structured text in trial records, natural language processing was used to identify common formatting patterns employed by trial sponsors in detailing these features. Success metrics were calculated from IQVIA™ Pipeline Intelligence based on medicines progressing to a subsequent research phase or being discontinued, suspended, withdrawn, or becoming inactive for three or more years (see Methodology). Each metric in each phase for each disease is indexed to the equivalent 2010 value for all diseases. Indices are available for each phase or as an average across phases.
*   An analysis of productivity was conducted across all trials started between 2010 and 2022, with details included for therapy areas: cardiovascular, dermatology, infectious diseases, endocrinology, immunology, neurology, oncology, respiratory, vaccines (separately from infectious diseases), and rare diseases.

*   Clinical development productivity — a composite metric of success rates, clinical trial complexity, and trial duration — rebounded in 2022, reversing a 10-year downward trend. Trial complexity returned to the previous trend after an outlier high in 2021, while overall success rates improved slightly.
*   Trial success rates were consistent with the baseline, indexing up slightly from 2021 but well below the highs of the past 10 years.
*   Trial complexity dropped sharply in 2022 after unusually high levels in 2021, which were driven by larger numbers of study subjects. All other components of the complexity indices declined slightly in 2022.
*   Trial durations have remained essentially flat from 2017, reflecting difficulties in recruiting patients for more rare diseases and longer follow-up periods after treatment, even as some trials have been exceptionally faster than historic norms.

Notes: Success rates and durations are indexed to the mean value for all diseases in 2010 equal to 1. The five complexity metrics are indexed to all diseases in 2010 equal to 1, and then summed, equaling 5.

**Averages/Trends:**
*   2010-2019 regulatory submission - avg 89%
*   Phase III - avg 67%
*   Phase II - avg 39%
*   Phase I - avg 56%
*   Composite success - avg 13.2%

*   The composite success rate for the pipeline fell to a 10-year low in 2022, but embedded an increase in Phase II and III rates, offsetting declines in Phase I and at regulatory submission.
*   Phase II success rates increased from 35% to 41% in one year, returning to the level last seen in 2017.
*   Phase III rates rose to 54%, still far below the 67% 10-year pre-pandemic average.
*   The pandemic has continued to disrupt the trials which are completed, and some trials which were understood to have failed in recent years due to extended inactivity had actually been continuing and have now completed successfully, resulting in retroactive restatement of past years success rates. The overall composite success rate in last year's report was 5.2%, compared to the restated 6.9% in the current analysis.
*   Phase I success rates dropped to 39%, a low since 2010 and down 7% from the 2021 rate.
*   Success rates for products filing for regulatory approval also reached a low level, dropping to 72% in 2022.

Notes: Phase success rates are calculated as the percentage of products reaching a subsequent phase in the year out of the total of products with an outcome including those which are discontinued, suspended or withdrawn as well as those which have been inactive for three years. The date three years after the last update determines which year the drug is considered to have gone inactive and become included in the denominator of the success rate, except when desk research has concluded the drug is still in active research. Product's research status is assessed in any geography globally.

*   2022's composite success rate of 6.3% was lower than the 10-year trendline in neurology, oncology, respiratory and cardiovascular classes.
*   While most disease areas worsened in 2022, almost all had prior years restated as research previously thought to have become inactive had new progress or updated activity.
*   While activity levels remained resilient during the pandemic, oncology and rare diseases — the two largest segments of the R&D pipeline — all saw substantial decreases in composite success rates in 2022, continuing a trend over recent years.
*   Vaccines, which had seen declining success from 2016 to 2019, saw significant increases in success except in Phase I in 2022, mostly driven by the success of COVID-19 vaccines.
*   Infectious diseases composite success declined slightly in 2022, continuing below the trendline for the observed period, driven by falling Phase I and regulatory submission successes.

Notes: Phase success rates are calculated as the percentage of products reaching a subsequent phase in the year out of the total of products with an outcome including those which are discontinued, suspended or withdrawn as well as those which have been inactive for three years. The date three years after the last update determines which year the drug is considered to have gone inactive and become included in the denominator of the success rate, except when desk research has concluded the drug is still in active research.

*   The drop in composite success rate in 2022 overlays a complex set of dynamics across therapeutic segments, which in 2021 ranged from 1% to 19%, and in 2022 showed a narrower range from 1% to 14%.
*   Infectious diseases, dermatology, and non-oncology rare diseases had the highest composite success rates in 2022, the same or slightly lower than their 2021 level.
*   Oncology, the largest segment of the pipeline, is currently seeing composite success rates of 3%, with slight differences between rare cancers (3%) and non-rare cancers (4%).
*   Rare diseases had a composite success rate of 7% in 2022, down from 14% in the prior year, reflecting highly dynamic results in these types of drugs.
*   Products for cardiovascular disease saw success in 2021 of 12%, more consistent with long-term trends with 2020 and 2022 both representing unusually low success rates. It remains to be seen whether these outlier periods will continue.

*   Following a period of increasing complexity in the first half of the last decade, trial complexity jumped in 2021 to an index of 136 compared to 2010 before dropping back to 121 in 2022, while still exceeding prior years.
*   The unusually high number of trial subjects in 2021, mainly in COVID-19 trials, is the main driver of lower overall complexity in 2022.
*   The drop in the number of sites and the number of countries across industry trials was another driver of the decline in 2022, with sites 2.5% below 2010 levels and countries returning to the baseline index of 100, and some of the reduction in these metrics driven by ongoing COVID-19 trial disruptions and the conflict in Ukraine.
*   The number of subjects on average has increased dramatically since 2018, with the 2021 index of 212 and 2022 at 154, both as a result of large-scale COVID-19 vaccine trials.
*   As the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the number of clinical trial subjects is likely to return to pre-pandemic levels.
*   These measures, while not definitive in determining the complexity of operating a trial, do provide a useful guide for the ongoing effort associated with trials.

Notes: Terminated and withdrawn trials were excluded from the analysis. Trials were industry sponsored and interventional. Diagnostics, behavioral therapies, supplements, devices, and medical procedures were excluded. Infectious diseases excludes vaccines.

*   In line with decreases in overall complexity, most of the evaluated therapy areas showed a decline in 2022.
*   Oncology trials, which are among the most complex using the index, saw a drop in complexity in 2022 to its lowest level since 2011. As with the pipeline in general, this drop is highly correlated with the drop in number of sites and countries, which began in 2015 but was amplified by the pandemic. The number of subjects did increase sharply in 2022, however, perhaps related to a shift away from rare cancers.
*   Rare disease trials have been showing a steady decline in complexity since 2015 due to a declining number of sites and subjects, indicating more focus on smaller patient populations with the exception of large Ebola trials started in 2019. Fewer sites for rare disease trials was a notable inflection in the last three years.
*   In recent years, vaccine trials have become increasingly larger than other trials and vary considerably in the number of subjects by disease target, with much larger trials in Ebola, influenza, and COVID-19 driving the increase in recent years.

Notes: Terminated and withdrawn trials were excluded from the analysis. Trials were industry sponsored and interventional. Diagnostics, behavioral therapies, supplements, devices, and medical procedures were excluded. Infectious diseases excludes vaccines.

*   Trials started in recent years may have durations based on planned completion versus actual confirmed dates, which could be artificially driving this trend down, especially during disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, making the latest three years an unreliable guide to the expected trends.
*   Prior to 2019, Phase III trials saw a moderate increase in trial duration — up to, on average, 2.7 years in 2018 compared to 2.2 years in 2010.
*   Prior to the most recent three years, the majority of trial durations were based on actual completion, whereas the most recent periods have less than 50% of trials with actual dates and include a mix of very accelerated actual trials as well as potentially unrepresentative estimates from sponsors.
*   As a result of these data latency issues, the duration information for 2019 is used for 2020 to 2022 in productivity indices elsewhere in this report, and these indices may be restated in later updates as actual durations are more reliably reported.

Notes: Trial durations are calculated as the time between trail start and the completion of the primary endpoints even as some trial activity may continue after this. In the data latency period, more than 50% of trials report planned end dates, which in combination with actual end dates that are unusually rapid, skew the durations downward in a pattern which is consistently restated over time. For analysis in the development productivity index, the last pre-latency period (2019) is used as the duration for the subsequent years.

*   Trial durations for different disease areas have been generally stable over the last decade, excluding the data latency period in the last three years.
*   Phase I trials are often very short, with all but oncology, rare diseases, vaccines, and dermatology averaging less than a year.
*   Total (all phases) oncology duration has come down by an average of 1% per year through 2018, with Phase II trials decreasing in duration at the greatest rate.
*   Oncology and rare diseases have the longest timelines in general across the disease areas, likely due to difficulties in finding and recruiting patients as well as extended observation periods to demonstrate treatment efficacy.

Notes: Terminated and withdrawn trials were excluded from the analysis. Trials were industry sponsored and interventional. Diagnostics, behavioral therapies, supplements, devices, and medical procedures were excluded. Trial duration is based on trial dates reported in clinical trial databases. Trial start date is the date on which the enrollment of participants for a clinical study began. Trial end date corresponds to when the trial ended or is expected to end. Vaccine trials are infectious disease only. Phase II includes Phases I/II, II, IIa, IIb. Phase III includes Phase II/III and III. Infectious diseases excludes vaccines.

*   The composite Clinical Development Productivity Index has dropped by 22% over the past decade.
*   All phases of clinical development showed declines in productivity in 2021, however Phase II and III rebounded in 2022, lifting overall productivity from 12.9 to 16.3, where the 2010 index is 20.
*   Phase II trials have consistently been above the overall index as success rates have remained more stable and trial durations have declined slightly, but success rates increased dramatically in Phase II in 2022, lifting overall productivity.
*   Phase III trials had seen a significant decline in productivity over the past five years, primarily due to decreasing probability of success and increasing durations, but rebounded as complexity dropped in the latest year.
*   While there is a great variability among therapy areas, the overall downward trend in productivity is believed to be a result of slowly increasing clinical trial timelines and decreasing probability of success, even as clinical trial complexity has seen modest reductions in recent years.
