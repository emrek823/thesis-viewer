Today, the Operators needs to understand overall GL / P&L
performance, service-line / CPT-level insights, and wRVU insights to
run the business, but the current process is very manual and complex:

*   Significant manual effort to parse through GL / P&L
*   Significant manual effort to answer ad-hoc questions related
    to P&L performance throughout the month
*   Complex manual effort to join datasets and run analysis to
    get to wRVU-level insights (e.g., gross charges per wRVU)
