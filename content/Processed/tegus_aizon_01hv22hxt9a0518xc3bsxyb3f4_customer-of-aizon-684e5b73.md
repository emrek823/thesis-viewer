# Customer of Aizon
Interview conducted on January 07, 2022

## Summary (Generated by Blue Heron)
[Customer Name] works in sales and marketing at Gilead Sciences, where he looked at Aizon's analytics solution during a recent evaluation of AI tools. [Customer Name] appreciated Aizon's manufacturing-optimization capabilities, but he says these were not relevant for his needs. He was looking for an AI-powered data-science product to help identify new customers for Gilead Sciences' solutions. [Customer Name] might recommend Aizon to colleagues on the pharmaceuticals side trying to improve their manufacturing process. For his use case, software like H2O.ai, DataRobot, and Databricks were more directly pertinent. [Customer Name] thinks Aizon could appeal to a broader segment of the market if it expanded its product to include tools outside of the manufacturing space. "Perhaps they could evolve as a product and then grow into more product-generic, data-science solution. They could build this platform to address some unmet need within commercial as well as clinical and R&D."

## Aizon evaluation
*   [Customer Name] says Aizon is a solid manufacturing-analytics tool that helps pharmaceutical players improve product quality, compliance, and efficiency.
*   Aizon includes features like omni detection and batch-process optimization designed to enhance manufacturing processes.
*   These aspects were not relevant to [Customer Name]'s use case, which focuses on marketing and sales. He was looking for a product that would leverage AI to predict the right customers for Gilead Sciences' product.
*   "Aizon is more into life-sciences manufacturing. Our commercial use cases were very different from manufacturing. In commercial, everything involved is predicting the right customers and informing marketing and sales strategy."
*   [Customer Name] considered Aizon in late 2020 but decided to focus on products that were more relevant to commercial and sales tasks.
*   He looked at H2O.ai, DataRobot, Databricks, Azure AI, and AWS SageMaker and ultimately chose one of these solutions, though he doesn't specify which one.
*   Pricing was a factor in [Customer Name]'s decision, but the main issue was finding the right match for his requirements.
*   [Customer Name] says he is unlikely to switch from his current provider.
*   Still, he would potentially recommend Aizon to pharmaceutical companies looking to solve manufacturing problems.
*   [Customer Name] says Aizon could be more relevant to sales and marketing teams if it expanded its product into a more general data-science platform.

## Expert Details
Customer: [Customer Name]
Tone: Neutral

## Blue Heron
What prompted you to evaluate Aizon and other solutions like it?

## Evaluated Aizon
We were starting to practice building ML solutions related to commercial use cases in pharmaceutical manufacturing. We were evaluating different data science solutions which would fulfill that need, and that's where Aizon came in.

## Blue Heron
What did your evaluation of Aizon yield for you?

## Evaluated Aizon
I don't remember the specifics. It looked like the product in itself is GxP (Good 'x' Practices) compliant. It's self-sufficient to intergenic predictions related to manufacturing. But my role was more focused towards commercial, so we were evaluating different products supervised machine learning at that time.

## Blue Heron
Do you know why you didn't go with Aizon?

## Evaluated Aizon
The actual evaluation would have been done by the pharmaceutical development and manufacturing team. I'm not involved in those discussions, so I don't remember any specifics. My focus is more for commercial. I was more focused on evaluating AI and analytics solutions that would fulfill commercial needs.

## Blue Heron
Did Aizon not do that?

## Evaluated Aizon
Right. Aizon is more into life-sciences manufacturing. Our commercial use cases were very different from manufacturing. In commercial, everything involved is predicting the right customers and informing marketing and sales strategy.

## Blue Heron
So, you did look at Aizon a little bit, but quickly realized it wouldn't be useful for your specific use case?

## Evaluated Aizon
That's correct.

## Blue Heron
What criteria would you have been using to evaluate whether or not it was useful for what you were doing?

## Evaluated Aizon
For commercial, we were looking at a solution which would double up machine learning algorithms or would help us predict on starting projects. But Aizon wasn't the right fit for that. There are other use cases that would be more relevant for Aizon that didn't fall into our purview.

## Blue Heron
When did that evaluation take place?

## Evaluated Aizon
I was around the last quarter of 2020.

## Blue Heron
In addition to Aizon, what other platforms were you looking at?

## Evaluated Aizon
We were looking at H2O.ai, DataRobot, and Databricks. We evaluated Azure AI as well as AWS SageMaker.

## Blue Heron
Did you end up going with one of those firms?

## Evaluated Aizon
Yes, we did.

## Blue Heron
Can you say which one?

## Evaluated Aizon
I wouldn't want to disclose that.

## Blue Heron
How would you describe Aizon's ROI or value proposition?

## Evaluated Aizon
Value proposition-wise, it has so many features like batch-process optimization, omni detection, and product manufacturing optimization. The value proposition is more relevant toward pharmaceutical manufacturing. It does have some value for sure, but it's more relevant towards the manufacturing and the GxP side of things. But for me to evaluate those business propositions and the ROI on those products would be a little difficult because I don't work in manufacturing.

## Blue Heron
What problem is Aizon addressing?

## Evaluated Aizon
That would be related to the product specifically and how to sell their product according to the use cases that different pharmaceutical companies would be looking at, specifically in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing. This product is totally focused upon optimizing solutions which could optimize some internal processes. It can reduce some manufacturing quality issues and work upon improving compliance as well. That could be one of the limitations in the sense that it's totally focused upon certain areas within manufacturing. Perhaps they could evolve as a product and then grow into more product-generic, data-science solution. They could build this platform to address some unmet need within commercial as well as clinical and R&D. That could be the best value proposition.

## Blue Heron
During your evaluation did you discover if Aizon is capable of integrations with any other software?

## Evaluated Aizon
It was very brief for us. It came up as one of the solutions. It does data management and uses AI to do some real-time and historical analysis. There were some connectors to connect it to large vendors like AWS, but that's it.

## Blue Heron
Who made the decision to start looking at these tools?

## Evaluated Aizon
It was my whole team, my manager and myself and a couple of folks.

## Blue Heron
In terms of the final decision, would that have been the whole team?

## Evaluated Aizon
Yes, we did a vote within the team.

## Blue Heron
How long did it take to make a final decision?

## Evaluated Aizon
I think the evaluation was going for around two months. Then we were evaluating based off the value proposition, and the problem-solving it could do for us. We also looked at the user experience and what we would eventually get out of the product. It went around for two months and then we finally decided.

## Blue Heron
How important was pricing in the decision?

## Evaluated Aizon
Pricing was definitely important, but not to that extent. We were more bound to get a solution which would fit our needs, even if it was a little more expensive. We then negotiate with vendors to come to a point where we think the solution could be taken into production.

## Blue Heron
Your department didn't deploy Aizon. Do you know if the more pharmaceutical side of things evaluated Aizon? Did they implement Aizon?

## Evaluated Aizon
No, we have limited interaction with the other teams within Gilead. Even if they did evaluate it, I'm not sure what happened.

## Blue Heron
In order for Aizon to be relevant to you at all, what features would it have needed to be a real candidate?

## Evaluated Aizon
Their mission manufacturing excellence and regulatory compliance. Their product would have also had to incorporate some more data science and machine learning cases like supervised machine-learning use cases. Those tools allow you to leverage the platform to predict and say who are going to be the patients or who are going to be the providers we will target. Then it would have been more useful for our use cases.

## Blue Heron
On a scale of 1-10, how likely would you be to recommend Aizon to someone on the pharmaceutical side?

## Evaluated Aizon
I would say 6 or 7. The value proposition still lies within manufacturing. If there are unmet needs where the pharmaceutical companies are looking for solutions geared toward solving manufacturing challenges or regulatory compliance things, then this could be one of the solutions where it does solve those kinds of problems. But obviously it depends case by case.

## Blue Heron
In terms of the tool you're using now, if they ceased to exist, how hard would it be to migrate to a competitor tomorrow?

## Evaluated Aizon
It would be hard. First, you have to do business integration with IT. Then there's a knowledge curve involved in learning a new tool or process or language. Definitely, there is a learning curve involved there and then converting the whole team toward the new solution could take some and whatnot. It would be hard. But depending on the value proposition, if it solves our problem in a better way than the existing solution, then definitely there's the potential to switch.

## Blue Heron
Do you have any idea who would be first on your short list to switch to?

## Evaluated Aizon
Right now I think we are on the best solution. There is no other product like what we are using after the evaluation was completed, and this is fairly new. But if another breakthrough product comes which is brand new that we haven't seen before and we like better, that could be one of the potential challengers. But as of now, I would say there isn't a great competitor.

## Blue Heron
Thank you.
