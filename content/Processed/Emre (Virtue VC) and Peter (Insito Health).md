### Peter Daggett - MedFinder/Insitohealth Overview

- Founded MedFinder after personal experience: got prescription, pharmacy was out of stock, spent week going back and forth with doctor
- Availability challenge affects 1 in 4 prescription patients annually (not just shortages)
- Core problem: prescription process is opaque, inflexible, and frustrating for all players
	- Providers: increased back-and-forth with patients
	- Pharmacies: administrative burden from routing issues
	- Pharma: lost revenue when patients can’t fill scripts
	- Payers: non-adherence increases total cost of care

### MedFinder 2.0 Product & Growth

- Launched July with AI voice agents handling pharmacy searches
- Growing 50% month-over-month for last two months
- Hit $2M+ run rate on consumer business
- 25% of patients come from provider referrals (no HCP marketing done)
	- Workflow: Doctor sends script → pharmacy out of stock → doctor refers to MedFinder
	- Alternative: patient googles after calling 5-10 pharmacies

### Upcoming Chrome Extension for Providers

- Launching in 1-2 weeks for psychiatry, primary care, metabolic, telehealth
- Chrome extension sits on browser-based EHRs (Elation, Charm, Practice Fusion)
- Embeds widget into existing e-prescribing workflow
- Removes pharmacy selection step, gives providers Photon-like experience for free
- Embeds MedFinder for patients who hit availability issues (zero CAC)
- Creates distribution network for manufacturer programs, coupon cards

### Infrastructure Layer Strategy

- Rebuilding prescription network infrastructure vs. building workarounds on existing systems
- Vision: kill Cover My Meds by eliminating non-dispensing pharmacy step
	- Direct EHR-to-pharmacy integration
	- Handle prior authorizations at pharmacy level, bounce back to EHR
	- Take over entire routing market
- Two-sided network across EHR integrations and pharmacy management systems

### Next Steps

- Peter sending memo and cell number for weekend questions
- Emre reviewing over weekend before San Francisco trip
- Follow-up call planned for more tactical business questions
