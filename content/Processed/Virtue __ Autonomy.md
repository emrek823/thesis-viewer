### Clinic-Level P&L Economics

- 3 physician practice baseline: 12-14K E&M visits, 8-9k unique patients
- Practices are LLC - everything is flow through to physician take home
- Revenue uplift with ancillaries:
	- Infusions improve net collections by 40-50%
	- Injectable opportunity adds 20-40%
	- Additional take home of 250-300k (consistent across 3 MD or 2 MD practices)
	- Larger practices exceed $1M by adding clinical research and imaging
- Economics:
	- Drug margin: 10-12%
	- $200 in spend related to infusion
	- Only 10% have infusions live today; 90% represent opportunity
	- Multiple chair setup flexes up admin revenue
	- Can’t replace infusion nurses but can optimize $30 verification process with AI

### Key Infusion Categories & Dynamics

- Core therapeutic areas:
	- Multiple Sclerosis
	- Neuromuscular
	- Headache
	- Future growth: Parkinson’s, ALS, Alzheimer’s
- Market penetration:
	- 10-15% of patient panel on infusion therapy
	- Additional 10-15% for migraine treatment
	- Memory population opens cognitive testing opportunity (GUIDE model)
- Competitive landscape example - Paragon:
	- Infusions as lucrative as oncology, rheumatology, gastro
	- Opened next to physician office, taking payer-specific business

### MSO Strategy & Growth

- Density strategy:
	- Must build strategic density vs. scattered growth
	- Focus on operations and contracts
	- Example: Bass Medical Group (Northern CA) - 9% fee but superior rates
- Rate improvement approaches:
	- IPA - limited by messenger model (can’t share rates)
	- CLN - common system enables better negotiation
	- Single TIN option
- Contract optimization:
	- Not all contracts have existing J-codes (e.g. J0585)
	- Opportunity to negotiate better E&M rates with infusion launch
- Growth targets:
	- 500 neurologists (averaging 3 per practice)
	- 25-50% penetration in key states
	- Focus states: Texas, New York, North Carolina, Florida

### Strategic Vision & Stickiness

- Goal to dominate independent neurology
- Winner-takes-all approach in target markets
- Key decisions in next 3-5 months:
	- What components to own
	- Sticky elements to focus on
	- Philosophy on workflow ownership
- Must make joining compelling and leaving difficult
	- Learning from others’ churn problems
	- Focus on both acquisition and retention drivers

### Financing & Partners

- $2M on SAFE
- Key commitments from:
	- Jake (Grow)
	- Zeal AI
	- Yury
	- Additional healthcare operators pending
- Focus on GTM/BD capabilities
- Rates comparable to Grow ($180-190) but adjusted for medical specialty vs virtual world
