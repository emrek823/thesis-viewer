### Science Bridge Global Overview

- AI-native life sciences IP marketplace connecting academic/global innovation with pharma/VC buyers
- Founded by Gianni Thomas (MD/MBA Harvard Business School graduate)
- Background: spun out company at Sloan Kettering, worked at Harvard’s tech transfer office managing 400 life sciences technologies
- Supply side sources:
	- De-prioritized assets in biotech companies
	- Global assets (especially China - visiting Tsinghua, positioning as bridge to Western capital markets)
	- Academic institutions (Johns Hopkins, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
- AI agents continuously source, translate, tag and catalog technologies
- 5,000 technologies currently on platform, targeting 20,000+ by seed round

### Platform & Customer Strategy

- End-to-end solution covering discovery, evaluation, licensing/contracting workflows
- Buy side customers:
	- Pharma external innovation teams (J&J meeting - dedicated sourcing teams struggle with manual processes)
	- VCs seeking access beyond Boston/SF hubs
	- Biotech R&D teams
- Technology database with scientific-level granularity and conversational AI search
- Direct connectivity between buyers and TTOs/scientists through platform
- Documentation workflows replacing email chains (12-24 month licensing processes)
- Fall pilot launching with representation from each customer segment

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Raising $1.5M pre-seed round
- Target milestones: 25 customers, $1-2M ARR within 18 months
- Virtue VC process: second call (60 minutes) → 7-10 day diligence → decision
- Typical investment: ~10% ownership for pre-seed rounds

### Action Items

- Gianni: send deck and 2-minute demo video
- Emre: review materials and follow up early next week
