**A:** Same as the above 2-3.

## Tegus Client
Thanks for talking about the pharmaceutical market. If you wouldn't mind starting with just give us your background a little bit more, also about your day-to-day responsibilities, what your organization is responsible for and the size of the operation.

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
I currently work for a pharmaceutical company, one of the very large pharmaceutical companies. I'm currently in intercompany operations. So I deal with cold chain shipments, replenishment stocks, we don't get involved with sending last mile or to direct to end user or customer. We're more about bulk transfers, both domestic and international lanes. I've only been in my current role for a few months, about three months.

But previously, I have experience with designing cold chain shippers on the vendor side that was before my current role, I was in that role for approximately five years running a cold chain testing lab, basically testing for also for driving sales and supporting our sales team while designing cold chain shippers. And then prior to that was my first job out of college. My degree is in engineering. I have Bachelors and Masters in engineering.

And right out of school, I started a different pharmaceutical company. That one was I was in a center of excellence. So no budgetary restraints really just concerned with cost savings and really integration and assisting the company. But with that role, I was involved with finished product shipments from completely finished product to end user.

So it was more of the small parcel, but also I did get involved with some international lane shipping as well. So lane qualifications and audit defense as well I was involved with any FDA audit defense but defense with foreign governing bodies auditing us. So that's just a little bit a bit more about my background.

## Tegus Client
Maybe we'll start with your current role. So the internal logistics organization, could you just sort of by the numbers talk about volume, total budget, headcount? How much stuff are you guys moving, what internal system do own and use, what CapEx do you own to use? Just give us a lay of the land there?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
As far as headcount, I believe there's seven or eight of us with international presence. So there's four of us in the U.S., there's two in the U.K. and one of us in Belgium. So we have pretty full coverage. In terms of how much we're involved with moving. Really, what we do is where SMEs for having the cold chain shipping solutions validated and qualified. We don't really involve ourselves too much with ops other than with the qualification and validation of the shippers.

We do a tech transfer, provide them with how do you correctly use the shipper and how long it's validated. And what we do is we really look at the lanes that the shipper is going to be used and if it's a new lane that's being shipped or something that hasn't been done before, we'll perform a performance qualification or performance validation with regards to that. And additionally, dotted lines are some of the colleagues that I work with are involved with new product launches.

So those will be moving from manufacturing site to our transportation centers, and then that will be dispersed out. So we've been involved with product launches. We loosely get involved with product launches as well. We are asked to support, but we do have team members their sole job is supporting that.

I was going to say that the solutions that we do qualify and validate are both, passive and active all the way from half pallet loads, not only finished product, but also APIs or active product ingredients. And all the way up through ULD size multipallet loads and also air cargo and ocean freight as well.

## Tegus Client
That's great. Can you tell me more about this qualification process, what you're looking for, like how you assess, what freight looks like, trends in the industry you're seeing as well and any emerging needs that you find interesting?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
I guess, going through the whole process, we would start off with URS or user requirement specification. What that is, is basically we get information from the site, site X wants to ship to site Y or we need to move a product or drug substance from X to Y. So the lane is the biggest thing, where it's going from how it's going.

So whether we can do a ground shipment or if it's going to be involved multi-modes, so it'd be combination of ground, air and possibly sea. From there, we would look at what are the temperature requirements of that product or substance that will be taken into consideration for the shipper design of validation.

Also any stability data that the product or substance has will greatly assist, we want to call that out early in the process that will help us if we're in a situation where we can for example, if we don't have to be fully temperature-controlled the whole way using, for example, temperature control cargo or ground shipments if we can put it into a qualified container and use nontemperature controlled cargo to transport that, that usually will cut cost.

So that will be a consideration down the line, obviously, not putting product at risk. And then from there, once we define all the characteristics that are needed for that product or substance, what we will do is we'll select either from an inventory that we maintain from one of our vendors or one of our systems.

If we have something that's already qualified and validated we'll look at what that previous lane was as long as the temperature requirements and lane modes and validations line up, and we view that as being nonrisk. We will leverage that qualification and that data to be able to shift that substance and go ahead with that shipment.

If for some reason, say, the previously qualified system was only validated for a three-day transit, but this current site from X to Y is going to be a five day, what we would most likely do is utilize that shipping solution but perform a performance qualification.

So what we would do is either most likely, you simulated load representing that product and go through shipments using that and make sure we go through the exact lane that's going through the modes that it's going to be taking temperature moderate through from point X to point Y and make sure that all of the characteristics are still maintained from temperature as well as the duration is accurately recorded.

And in addition to the vendors operational qualification data, we'll use our performance qualification data to support that shipment, and then we will give them to go ahead. They're clear. And of course, all at least protocol for us is to always actively monitor all products and substances for temperature and so all shipments are actively monitored and uploaded to a cloud system, so we have maintained that data as well.

## Tegus Client
You said that all things are actively monitored and uploaded where?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
To like a cloud system. So we will retain that temperature data, but also will maintain location of that shipment. So if an issue does arise, we can actively intervene, we use GPS geo fencing just to alert us or the quality team if a shipment is not reached a certain mode in a certain amount of time, then we can actively intervene with our vendor or our transportation or freight vendors as well.

But also we can maintain temperature as well. So that we'll be able to see in real time but also historically keep track of shipments that go from X to Y so we can create trends in the future. So what we do is we just build a database of temperature as well as durations between the two locations.

## Tegus Client
And can you tell me more about is this an off the shelf sort of piece of software that you're using to monitor all this, is it built in-house?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
It is. So we have teams that are involved with maintaining this system. It's multifaceted. So what we use it for is just maintaining temperature and location, but ops will use this system is used, but it is not in-house created that we rely on a vendor for it. I'm sure all the temperature data and everything and data points are maintained locally, but we rely on a vendor for this as well.

So I've used it. I know not all sites are using a cloud-based system where everything is monitored in real time. A lot of times, we'll use temperature monitors and data loggers that, once they arrive, have to be downloaded and then the data can be uploaded. So it's not 100% real time, but we're slowly transitioning to this real-time monitoring system so we can get access to all that data whenever we would like if needed.

## Tegus Client
Is that an internally stated goal to trend to have the entire system be like real time. Is that like an internal project with budgeted line ahead?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
I'm not sure about that. I know that it's one of our company and corporate goals to move towards more, I guess, it's loosely automation, but really just get it more involved with really move to actively monitor systems so that we don't have the product loss and get intervene, if necessary, because sometimes the cost is justified by potentially losing a shipment and we were able to hold our vendors accountable. So that's really the motivation behind that goal.

## Tegus Client
So you mentioned that all shipments are being actively monitored for temperature and that data is being uploaded into a cloud system. And that cloud system is provided by your vendor. Is that correct?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
Correct.

## Tegus Client
Got it. But I'm assuming for a company of Pfizer's size, you probably need to work with a handful of different vendors, right? You don't have just one vendor handle your entire supply chain.

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
Correct. So it's strictly just maintaining the loggers and that information. It's one that maintains location data, GPS data of all active shipments, but also temperature data. But as far as what product it is, cost, it's not fully encompassing, like it's strictly just for the shipments.

## Tegus Client
It makes sense. So it's for the shipment itself, it's not necessarily on a per unit basis, per master carton basis, per pallet basis, it's for the entire shipment itself, right? Like whatever is being transported.

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
Correct. And yes, we actually do have loggers on every pallet.

## Tegus Client
Like whatever the most like discrete transportation level it is, would be logged but not necessarily, like, hey, inside each box or inside each master carton because that would just be prohibitively expensive?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
Correct. It's really on a container basis. So whether that container is a half pallet or a pallet basis. These loggers are, and that's the thing is the loggers we've worked with our container vendors as well to integrate them to our shipping solutions. So that's also part of the challenge.

## Tegus Client
If you have multiple vendors and they all use different cloud systems or they all use different logger types and devices, how do you stitch them together? How does your company and your team manage this business altogether? Or are you hopping between four or five different systems?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
We're hoping. And that's why I think the push is really to go to this one system. Right now, we're still using older technology and having to upload them in other systems. So depending on which loggers the site is using, sometimes not all sites are using the newest and greatest, so we do have to use some of the older systems at times.

## Tegus Client
What is considered newest and greatest for you today?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
Newest and greatest is real-time temperature monitoring. So it gives us information, so what I have access to is temperature information of the product or of the thermal couple that's placed inside the shipping container and then location of where it is in route, I think it's updates hourly.

So it will tell us where that container is as long as we search by the logger type, but I do know that we've had some issues with our data loggers, and we've worked with the company to get unlock other information that was helpful for us. And so really what's controlled is there's a lot of information that's gathered.

The biggest thing is I have access to temperature of the product and location. But another piece of information I do know is it's recorded, but not always shared is temperature of the actual logger. We were having issues with them freezing in transit. So we were able to worked with a vendor to get that information as well.

## Tegus Client
Is there a specific name of a software that you guys are using off the shelf where you are uploading the logger data? Or is there one vendor that you're currently working with and you really like their system and you're adding data from the three other vendors into their cloud?

I know you mentioned you don't have your own homegrown system yet, but curious what are the names of the software? How are you doing this today? Like if you're shipping it today, like how is that happening?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
So we're moving to Controlant, it is the vendor. And previously, the only other loggers that I've seen used on shipments are Sensitech Ultras, which we don't upload Sensitech data to Controlant. We have to have two separate systems for that.

## Tegus Client
And is this a selection that you make while you're choosing like the supply chain vendor or the logistics vendor? Or do you just have to use whatever they use?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
We are tied to what the distribution center that's sending the product, we're tied to what they have and what they use. We're trying to get everybody online to use the newer system, but we're either tied to the site or if the logger is not fully integrated into their shipping solution that they're using.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And so you mentioned right now, we have the temperature data, we have location, GPS data. Roughly what's a quarter at like the shipping level, not necessarily at the product level, so that could be on the pallet, ELD container level. That's fine. What data do you wish you had? Like what would make a difference for your job or your team or for the product?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
So that the fact that these are mostly finished product and then some active product ingredients, I would say, depending on the cost of the load. I would say shock and vibe would also be great to have.

Shock and vibration. I would say if the container is dropped, experiences that could give us information if the shipper is damaged. And not only is the thermal integrity compromised, but also if the shipper container itself, the product itself is jeopardized in any way, I think that would be pretty valuable to have as well.

## Tegus Client
Just to follow up on that question. So just to ask it another way, are there events in shipping projects and programs where some of these missing pieces of data have resulted in some sort of catastrophic loss or spoilage or something like that? And what is usually the cause when that does happen?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
At my time here, I haven't experienced anything that we didn't have data to support. The only issue that I do know that's arisen as we've had issues with one of our shippers, it's poorly designed. And the issue is, during a product launch, we were loading a trailer with a lot of these shipping containers and when they're in close proximity to each other, there wasn't enough gap in room and the loggers ended up freezing.

And we lost a lot of data for those shipments. So that's why we worked with our vendor and they were able to pull actual logger temperatures, so we can at least identify when this is happening, what side it's happening and what point mode that's occurring, so we're able to remedy the situation that way.

## Tegus Client
In that situation, when you don't have data end to end, does the product get used at risk, so to speak? Or is that product sequestered and not used?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
It's sequestered and an investigation is launched. So then it goes to quality and really goes into a full investigation of the entire shipment just to see if any deviations were to occur and then we, of course, that investigation will work with our vendors in that situation, they might pull temperature data from the actual vendors.

We usually don't concern ourselves with, for example, a trailer or ocean containers' temperature data. But for something like that, if we do lose data, we'll look to see if the vendor does maintain data that we can use to support to still using the product.

## Tegus Client
Just to go another topic. For these vendors that you're using, two questions. Number one is, I know you've only been at the current company for a few months now, but how often does your company switch vendors? And number two, if you do have a new vendor, how do you do pilots with them? Or how do you derisking? Because I know, obviously, this is a painful for many companies in cold chain.

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
Correct. So I would believe it would be a multiyear agreement. I don't think they would go into an agreement with a vendor for a year. I think it would probably be three- to five-year agreements. And of course, that's handled by other teams and we just get told to leave. So we have some input for that.

## Tegus Client
And the second question was, if your team or your company were to add a new vendor, what does that process look like, right? So how do you think about the collection? How do you think about derisking? How do you think about pilot as an example?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
They would go through pilots. They wouldn't do a full rollout. They would most likely select, they might go to a particular site and just monitor, use a select number of shipments and then slowly branch it out from there.

I know I've only been with the company for a few short months, but I've had multiple trainings on using the software and accessing data in the cloud. So it's nearing the end of its pilot stage, but I'm at least looped in and if they seem to be rolling it out to other DCs.

## Tegus Client
I know you worked with a handful of different shipping vendors, like whether truckers or freight forwarders. Do you have a short list of a favorite that you really like?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
I would say, Kuehne+Nagel is definitely a large one, DHL and then UPS as well. I would say these are the top three.

## Tegus Client
Fair enough. I mean they are the big dogs in the world. Kuehne+Nagel is the first thing off your tug. Why was that one first?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
It's the one I've seen the most since starting here. It's probably the one that especially with my team, with my manager being located in the U.K., I feel like just with regards to the international lanes and it's used a lot.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And I know you mentioned this briefly in your short bio, but what percentage of your work is considered cold chain versus just like dry goods?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
Yes, I would say 100% cold chain. We do get involved as far as we do room temperature transportation as well. I don't know if you consider that cold chain or not. But I would say the majority is two to eight. We do the ultra-cold as well or dry ice, but with room temp also occurring as well. So I would say 100% is temperature controlled.

## Tegus Client
Got it. Are you working on dedicated teams with NK and DHL and UPS for cold chain? Or is it like different teams they route you do to different things?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
We have different teams specifically associated with those vendors. And I really haven't gotten to know too much of the logistics team, but we have logistics teams for every site that would do the container bookings and everything else.

## Tegus Client
Got it. I think you mentioned there's another team that does the selection, but how price sensitive are you when selecting services for cold chain.

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
So we're pretty tied to cost from just shipping container systems aspect we, of course, have our vendors that are qualified and use, a lot of that is tied, I would say, cost is definitely one of the top attributes that we focus on, but also ability to supply and presence as well because we're a global team. We work out of the U.S. as well.

## Tegus Client
How often would you have like, I don't know, urgent, last minute, super sensitive shipment or cargo that like is fairly priced and elastic that? Because we're talking to other folks as well, and I think sometimes they mentioned that for certain launches or certain types of products. It just needs to be there in two hours, no other issues aside. Like how often do you have those types of shipments or orders?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
I haven't been looped in on any of those. So I would say not very frequently. I think that every now and then we might need to replenish a site and haven't had that happen, I just know that the last three years have been absolutely nuts. So everything is slowing down now. And we have a lot more time. I think we have a little bit more time to plan and work through that.

## Tegus Client
If you had a magic wand to fix something really critical in industry? What would you want to fix?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
I know it's very complicated and it's very difficult to work with several different vendors at the same time. And everything is very siloed just to conduct a shipment, and that's usually why we get involved with product launches, where our team is discussing product launches that are happening in 2025 right now, which really should be the case. So I would say I would like to fix that.

## Tegus Client
I'm sorry, just so I understand and make sure I understand you want to fix like how complicated it is to work with multiple different vendors that handle shipments?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
Correct. Of course, our team is involved with selecting and qualifying and validating the shipping container, but getting it from point A to point B especially in such a large organization and maybe it's just our organization's issue, but there's just so many different teams and everybody has to have their hand in it. It just becomes a long-term process.

## Tegus Client
That's super helpful. When you say everyone has their hand in it, and it's really hard to work across multiple vendors, like what are the big issues that come about from this? Like it's just super inefficient, is it you're missing stuff. Where is this really tied?

## Transport Qualification Manager at Pfizer
I think at a bare minimum, I don't know all the internal stakeholders, especially for my organization. Everybody seems to have different experience levels with whether it's at the site level, whether it's at what logger system are you supposed to use?

Who are you supposed to contact if it's going from the DC into the next, who we needs to involve, there are several different quality teams, whether it's outbound shipments, inbound shipments or whatnot.

So can very quickly go from just a simple ask or trying to gather information or we want to send a shipment of this product as we have to get people involved that associated with that product. We have to get the product teams involved. We have to get the quality at both sites involved. You have to get logistics involved. So it grows as you grow and add more people that it gets out of hand.

## Tegus Client
That's very helpful. I really appreciate the time. Enjoy the rest of your day.
