### Parth’s Background & Experience

- Medical background: Duke undergrad → McKinsey (healthcare/hospital operations) → Duke MD → Gates Foundation (Covax & women’s health) → Pathai (November 2021)
- Built diagnostics division from 0 to $15M ARR and 7-person global team
	- Enterprise imaging platform + AI point solutions for pathology workflow
	- Customers: health systems, independent labs, academic medical centers, Quest, LabCorp
- Left Pathai in May 2025 to focus on direct care delivery vs. pure B2B SaaS

### NP MSO Value Proposition

- Market demand validation: 5-6 NPs interviewed all said “I didn’t get an MBA, have no idea how to do this on my own”
- Economics advantage over direct care models
	- Higher average revenue per NP vs. per-patient acquisition
	- Zero/minimal customer acquisition costs for NPs (patients come organically)
	- Comparison: competitor spending 70% of dollars on marketing costs
- Strategic benefits
	- Cross-clinic data power for AI systems and predictive analytics
	- Integrated primary care (FNPs) + behavioral health (PMHNPs) network for cross-referrals
	- Positioned for value-based contracts with insurers

### Target NP Profile

- De novo practices only (avoiding multi-EHR complexity)
- 5-10 years experience, currently in big health systems
- Seeking flexibility/autonomy
	- Parents wanting work-life balance
	- Tired of long commutes, on-call, weird hours
	- Want to attend kids’ soccer games, school events
- Geographic focus: suburban/rural areas 30-45 minutes outside major cities
	- Boston area (Karas, Massachusetts)
	- Maryland (45 minutes from DC/Baltimore)
	- Underserved areas with 4-6 month PCP wait times

### Investment Framework Discussion

- Three evaluation criteria for MSO models
	- Market fragmentation ✓
	- Provider revenue increase (ideally significant bump vs. 20-30%)
	- Long-term payer value (cost savings, improved outcomes)
- Comparison to portfolio company Roo (neurology MSO)
	- Ancillary infusions can nearly double neurologist salary
	- Site of care shift creates clear cost savings for payers

### Current Status & Next Steps

- Not actively fundraising but open to right partner
- ~1 year runway, currently bootstrapping
- Two NPs currently being papered
- Interest in NYC networking events with portfolio companies
- Connection to Otto Health founder (Maxine) for lessons learned on NP MSO model
