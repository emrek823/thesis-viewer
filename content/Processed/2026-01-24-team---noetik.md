### Ron W. Alfa, MD, PhD

#### Co-Founder, CEO

Before Noetik:

SVP, Head of Research at Recursion (RXRX), Early employee from Seed through IPO. Stanford University M.D, Ph.D in Neuroscience.

Why Noetik:

"We founded NOETIK from the observation that we're facing a translation gap between basic drug discovery science and therapeutics success in the clinic. That gap is impacting the progress for patients and is unacceptable. Today we're at an inflection point where the convergence of computational methods and biology at scale can transform how we're discovering and developing drugs. We founded NOETIK to build the AI biotech of the future."
