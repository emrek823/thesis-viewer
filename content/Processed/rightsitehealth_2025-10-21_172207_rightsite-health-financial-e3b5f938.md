1. As a reminder, we are continuing to report results against the May-25 forecast

### MD&A

Net revenue fell short of forecast due to a combination of delayed contracting, an influx of new physicians requiring credentialing and lower than forecasted EMS call volume. Most of the miss came in Atlanta while Florida is now contributing to the negative variance as we are subject to current local government dynamics.

During August we evaluated Grady's call data and discovered they were sending only 1/3 of eligible dispatch calls. Once identified, Grady management launched new oversight and training in mid-September. As a result Atlanta volume was up 21% from Aug to Sept and total RightSite call volume was up 26%. Grady volume has remained steady into October

Though the impact in September was small, we began billing Molina TX for case rates after we executed the agreement and were configured in Molina's billing system.

Patient Care Expenses were higher than forecast but came down $10 per episode from Aug to Sept due to the call volume increase. The negative variance comes from overstaffing physicians, driven primarily by the initial overestimation of Ft. Worth call volume.

Adjusted SG&A was in line with forecast.

### MD&A

#### September Snapshot
*   Activations ended the month below forecast (-15%). Georgia was the primary driver of the Activation miss (-23%) while Florida was a miss as discussed on the prior page. Texas activations were 3% over budget but 6% behind expected diversions due to the quality of calls coming from Ft Worth during the initial 3 weeks of implementation.
*   Correspondingly, diversions were also below plan (-25%), as result of lower GA Activations and lower diversion rates (52% vs. forecasted 59%) from the recently on-boarded physicians. Improvement to physician/patient communication training has increased October MTD diversion rate to 56%

### MD&A
*   September cash ended at $13.5M, a negative variance (-$111k)
*   Net Revenue was $73.3k, a negative variance (-$172.3k)
    *   lower activation/diversion volume
    *   new physicians missing credentialing
    *   delayed case rate contracting
*   Net Revenue / Episode was $66, a negative variance of $123.
*   Patient Care Cost / Episode was a negative variance of $92, driven by physician staffing in anticipation of higher call volume from Ft. Worth EMS. Note It takes 4-6 months to fully license and credential a new physician so we begin the hiring process in advance of forecasted agency implementations
*   Without the activation volume miss, Patient Care Cost / Episode would have been $284 compared to the $242 target
