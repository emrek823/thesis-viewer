- Self-insured employer model using defined contribution approach
	- Employee + employer contributions packaged into tax-advantaged savings account (37-40% of premium)
	- Front-loaded funds for consumer use without financial barriers
	- $6,500 out-of-pocket max with $2,500 deductible “doughnut hole”
	- Single card combining insurance and debit functionality
	- HSA-like rollover but funds stay purpose-restricted

### Product Differentiators & Economics

- Provider payment model:
	- Allowed amounts based on 25th percentile of existing contracts
	- National clearinghouse integration (Availity, etc.)
	- Full price transparency before service delivery
	- Deleted low-ROI pre-auth and utilization management under $6,500
- Member service as core differentiator:
	- “They might come for the cash but stay for the service”
	- 30% overhead typically spent on case management reinvested into customer service
	- 10-15 year healthcare experience staff with unlimited member support time
	- Building AI tools from high-fidelity interaction data
- Unit economics:
	- All-in $55 PMPM administrative fee for core Vivian services
	- Shared upside economics on growing trust balances
	- Future fully insured model targeting 10,000+ lives
	- Consumer marketplace potential for directed wellness spending
