### Charles Yang’s Background & Journey

- Former materials science at Berkeley → computer science, focused on AI for scientific discovery
- Research experience in composite materials and optical metamaterials
- ML engineer at AI hardware startup in Bay Area
- Department of Energy (2023-February 2025)
	- AI policy advisor, helped establish new AI office
	- Worked with 17 national labs on AI for Science strategy
- Currently at Renaissance Philanthropy (backed by Schmidt Futures)
	- Organized autonomous science instruments workshop (October, San Diego)
	- 50 attendees: researchers, startups, investors including Thermo Fisher, Sefla, Lab Rack

### “Andoril for Science Instruments” Thesis

- Key insight: Science instrument companies need full portfolio solutions, not single products
- Current lab automation space overcrowded with limited ceiling companies
	- Mentions Periodic, LILA, Madra, Zion as unlikely to succeed
	- Most focus on commoditized low-level instruments
- Electron microscopy as uncrowded wedge opportunity
	- Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) generates 10-20 GB/second
	- Each run produces ~1TB of data
	- Researchers using outdated hardware (P5000 Nvidia, RTX cards from 2-3 generations ago)
	- Massive compute-capability mismatch

### Market Opportunity & Strategy

- Primary target: Semiconductor industry
	- Each fab has 30+ STEM instruments
	- Apple outsources chip verification to metrology labs
	- Industry struggling with AI adoption due to lack of expertise
- Edge compute requirement (can’t stream 20 GB/second to cloud)
- Go-to-market model similar to CryoSpark
	- Free academic licenses, paid industrial licenses
	- Academic labs serve as adoption hubs for industry learning
- Expansion path from software → CRO/metrology lab → instrument portfolio

### Immediate Plans & Team Building

- Moving to Boston in 2 weeks (near Longwood Medical Center)
- Next 6-8 weeks goals:
	- Get GUI feedback from national lab contacts
	- Secure deployment commitments from labs
	- Identify 2 key hires
- Team structure (leveraging AI coding tools for smaller team):
	- 1 physics grad student for computational work
	- 1 software engineer (full-stack with ML background)
- Existing relationships:
	- David Mueller (Cornell, invented STEM technique) - sending 2 graduating students
	- National Renewable Energy Lab contact
	- Plans SF trip in 6 weeks for engineering hire

### Next Steps

- Charles: Not raising currently, will reconnect in 2-3 months
- Virtue team: Will connect Charles with former Tetra Science co-founder in Boston
