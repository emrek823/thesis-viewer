Thought process: Weighed learning versus coding for world models and multimodal robotics approaches.

The user is asking two deep, interconnected questions about AI/robotics development approaches:

1. Is coding (programming/symbolic approaches) the way to build world models?
2. Is vision the key modality to advance robotics?

These are fundamental questions in AI research right now. Let me think through the current state of play and what matters for a healthcare VC.

For world models:
- Traditional approach: hand-coded rules, symbolic AI
- Modern approach: learned world models from data (video prediction models like Sora, GAIA, etc.)
- The debate: can you "code" physics and common sense, or must it be learned?
- Recent trends: video generation models as implicit world models, multimodal foundation models

For robotics + vision:
- Vision has been central to robotics perception
- But there's a debate about whether vision alone is sufficient
- Tactile sensing, proprioception, force feedback are increasingly important
- Recent work on embodied AI, RT-2, PaLM-E suggests multimodal approaches

The "so what" for healthcare VC:
- Surgical robotics: vision is critical but haptic feedback matters enormously
- Care robots: need to understand and predict human behavior
- Rehabilitation: proprioception and force sensing are key
- The companies that integrate multiple modalities may have advantages

Let me search for recent developments to give current perspective.
````

These are two of the most debated questions in AI/robotics right now, and they're deeply interconnected. Let me search for the latest thinking on both.

Thought process: Synthesized competing approaches to world models and multimodal robotics integration.

I now have a comprehensive picture. Let me synthesize this for the healthcare VC with the "so what" angle.

Key points:
1. On world models: The consensus is shifting AWAY from hand-coded approaches toward learned world models from video/multimodal data. But there's a big debate between two camps:
   - DeepMind/OpenAI: Scale video data, world model emerges from the statistical soup
   - LeCun/Meta: Need new non-generative architecture (JEPA)
   
2. On vision for robotics: Vision is necessary but NOT sufficient. The field is rapidly moving toward multimodal fusion:
   - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are hot
   - Tactile is critical for manipulation tasks
   - Haptic feedback in surgical robotics is a key missing piece

3. Healthcare-specific:
   - Da Vinci 5 (2025) finally adding haptic feedback
   - World models are being applied to disease progression, surgical planning
   - The vision-only approach has been a limitation in surgical robotics
   - Meta-analysis shows haptic feedback significantly improves outcomes

So what for a healthcare VC:
- Companies building multimodal (vision + tactile + force) surgical systems have a technical moat
- World model approach could be transformative for surgical planning/simulation
- The sim-to-real transfer problem is critical - video world models might help
- Watch for: startups integrating learned world models with robotic surgery
````

These are perhaps *the* defining questions in AI/robotics right now, and the answers have massive implications for where healthcare robotics is heading. Let me break down what the research landscape tells us.

## On World Models: Coded vs. Learned

The short answer: **coding is losing; learning from video is winning—but it's complicated.**

The field has essentially fractured into two camps:

1. **The "Scale Video" Camp** (DeepMind, OpenAI, NVIDIA): World models learn by watching video or digesting simulation data, building internal representations of objects, scenes and physical dynamics. Instead of predicting the next word, they predict what will happen next in the world. DeepMind's Genie 3 can now generate dynamic worlds you can navigate in real time at 24 fps, retaining consistency for a few minutes at 720p resolution.

2. **The "New Architecture" Camp** (Yann LeCun): He argues an entirely new non-generative AI architecture will provide the necessary scaffolding rather than hoping world models "spontaneously congeal within a neural network's statistical soup."

The key insight is that current video generators like Sora/Veo aren't true world models because they lack frame-level interactivity and frame-to-frame dynamic modeling—they can't respond to actions. True world models need to be *action-conditioned*.

## On Vision for Robotics: Necessary but Insufficient

Here's where it gets interesting for healthcare. **Vision alone is hitting a wall.**

The field is rapidly consolidating around Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but the cutting-edge work is adding tactile and force modalities. Vision provides global information on object position, posture, and geometry, while touch offers local feedback on force, surface properties, and slip detection. By combining these modalities, robots can overcome single modality limitations.

This is precisely what surgical robotics has struggled with. The lack of haptic feedback remains one of the biggest technical problems in current robotic systems. Surgeons can't physically "feel" tissue resistance or texture while operating these machines.

A meta-analysis of 56 studies found haptic feedback was effective in reducing average forces and peak forces applied during surgery, as well as reducing completion time. Haptic feedback also led to higher accuracy and success rates during surgical tasks.

Notably, providing both vision and force feedback leads to better tissue characterization than only vision or force feedback alone.

---

## The "So What" for Healthcare Investing

**1. The world model wave is coming to healthcare.** There's already work on world models for healthcare that learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care—from disease progression modeling to surgical planning. EchoWorld, for instance, pre-trains a motion-aware world model for echocardiography that encodes anatomy and the effect of probe motion.

**2. Multimodal is the moat.** The next generation of surgical robotics will integrate vision + haptic + force feedback. Intuitive Surgical announced haptic feedback for Da Vinci 5 in 2025, but startups like Edge Medical Robotics are betting on AI-powered soft-tissue surgical robots with real-time tactile sensing, giving the robot a simulated sense of touch.

**3. Sim-to-real is the unlock.** The emerging stack looks like: video world models → synthetic training data → robotic policy transfer. NVIDIA's Cosmos explicitly enables synthetic data generation, policy evaluation, and closed-loop simulation for robotics.

**Investment thesis questions to ask:**
- Is the company building proprietary multimodal datasets (action-labeled, not just video)?
- Can their world model actually respond to interventions, or is it just fancy video prediction?
- For surgical companies: are they integrating haptic/force sensing, or still vision-only?
- What's their sim-to-real transfer strategy?

The companies that crack "learned physics + multimodal perception + action conditioning" will own the next decade of healthcare robotics. Vision got us 80% of the way there; the last 20% requires touch.

Great context. Let me break down what Physical Intelligence is doing with OpenPI and why it matters.

---

## Physical Intelligence: The Company

**The setup:** Founded 2024 by ex-Google DeepMind roboticists and Stanford/Berkeley academics. Physical Intelligence was founded in 2024 by former Google DeepMind researchers as well as academics from Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley.

**The raise:** Physical Intelligence closed a $600 million Series B in November 2025 led by CapitalG at a $5.6 billion post-money valuation, up from a $2 billion valuation in November 2024. Total raised: ~$1.07B. Investors include Bezos, OpenAI, Thrive, Lux, T. Rowe Price, Index Ventures.

**The thesis:** Build the "Android for robots"—a single foundation model that controls any robot, any task, without task-specific programming.

---

## What π0 Actually Is (The Technical Breakdown)

π0 is a **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** model—essentially GPT for robot control. Here's the architecture:

**1. Foundation:** It builds upon a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), specifically PaliGemma with 3 billion parameters, and extends it with an action generation mechanism using flow matching.

**2. The secret sauce—Flow Matching:** Instead of discrete action tokens, π0 uses *flow matching* (a diffusion-inspired technique) to generate continuous, high-frequency motor commands. This is critical for dexterous manipulation where precision matters.

**3. Architecture (π0 vs π0.5):**
- **π0:** VLM backbone + action expert using flow matching
- **π0.5 (upgraded):** A hierarchical architecture where during pre-training the discrete action tokens are predicted via FAST tokenizer. Post training using flow matching is used for continuous actions. For inference, a high-level textual subtask is predicted first, followed by low-level action prediction.

In plain English: π0.5 first "thinks" about *what* to do (high-level reasoning), then generates *how* to do it (precise motor commands). This two-stage approach mirrors how humans plan.

---

## What OpenPI Provides

The openpi repository provides: code and model weights for running the base pre-trained π0 model, several checkpoints fine-tuned for simple tasks on widely available platforms like ALOHA and DROID, example code to run inference on several real-world and simulated robot platforms, and code for fine-tuning the base π0 model for your own tasks and platforms.

**Key capability:** Between 1 and 20 hours of data was sufficient to fine-tune to a variety of tasks.

This is massive. Traditional robotics requires thousands of hours of task-specific programming. PI is claiming you can adapt their foundation model to new tasks with ~1-20 hours of demonstration data.

---

## The Business Model

Physical Intelligence runs a B2B software-as-a-service model for robotics companies, manufacturers, and automation integrators. Pricing is a $300 monthly subscription per connected robot, yielding recurring revenue that scales with fleet deployments.

They're *not* building robots—they're selling the brain. Rather than manufacturing hardware, Physical Intelligence provides hardware-agnostic AI models that work across different robot embodiments.

---

## The "So What" for Healthcare

**Why this matters for healthcare robotics:**

1. **The portability problem is being solved.** Surgical robots, rehab robots, and care robots all currently require bespoke software. If a single foundation model can transfer across embodiments with minimal fine-tuning, it dramatically reduces development costs and time-to-market.

2. **The data bottleneck is real—and they're addressing it.** This project requires extensive real-world operational data, which is currently scarce. Consequently, Physical Intelligence is compiling its own datasets, supported by advancements in AI models that can process visual information. Healthcare companies building surgical or care robots could potentially leverage pre-trained foundation models rather than starting from scratch.

3. **Language-conditioned control is underappreciated.** π0 takes natural language instructions ("pick up the scalpel") and translates them to motor commands. For OR robotics, this could enable intuitive surgeon-robot interaction.

4. **However—the tactile gap persists.** π0 is fundamentally vision-language-action. There's no force feedback, no haptic sensing, no proprioceptive understanding of tissue compliance. For surgical applications where touch matters (see our earlier discussion), this is a critical limitation.

---

## Investment Implications

| **Bull Case** | **Bear Case** |
|---------------|---------------|
| First-mover in robot foundation models with best-in-class team | Vision-only; no haptic/force feedback for surgical precision |
| Open-source strategy drives ecosystem adoption | $300/robot/month SaaS may face pricing pressure |
| Hardware-agnostic = massive TAM | Competitors (Skild, Covariant) pursuing similar strategies |
| Pre-training on 10K+ hours of robot data creates data moat | Healthcare regulation/validation timeline is long |

**The key question for healthcare:** Can a vision-language foundation model be extended to incorporate force/tactile modalities? Or will healthcare robotics require purpose-built multimodal models?

Covariant and Skild AI pursue similar hardware-agnostic strategies, building general-purpose robot foundation models that integrate with multiple robot platforms. These companies compete directly on model performance, training efficiency, and developer ecosystem adoption.

**My read:** PI is building the "base model" layer for robotics, similar to what OpenAI did for language. For healthcare, the opportunity is in the *vertical application layer*—taking foundation models like π0 and fine-tuning them with domain-specific data (surgical video, haptic feedback, OR workflows). The startup that cracks "π0 + haptics + surgical domain adaptation" could be very interesting.

The user wants me to explain the technical advancements of Physical Intelligence in simple, beginner-friendly terms. Let me break down the key innovations without jargon.
````

Great question. Let me strip away the jargon and explain what Physical Intelligence actually built that's new.

---

## The Problem They're Solving

**Traditional robotics works like this:**

You want a robot to fold a towel? An engineer spends months writing specific code: "move arm to position X, grip at force Y, rotate 45 degrees, etc." 

Want that same robot to pour coffee? Start over. New code. New months of work.

Every task = custom programming. Every robot = custom programming. This doesn't scale.

---

## What Physical Intelligence Built (The 4 Big Ideas)

### 1. One Brain for All Robots

**Old way:** Each robot type (single arm, dual arm, mobile robot) needs its own software.

**PI's way:** They built one AI model (π0) that can control *any* robot. Same brain, different bodies.

**Analogy:** It's like how you can install Android on phones from Samsung, Google, or OnePlus. π0 is "Android for robots"—one operating system that works across different hardware.

---

### 2. Learning from Watching (Not Programming)

**Old way:** Engineers manually program every movement.

**PI's way:** π0 learns by watching demonstrations—like how a child learns by observing adults.

**The breakthrough:** You only need 1-20 hours of demonstration data to teach it a new task. Show a robot how to fold laundry a few times, and it figures out the pattern.

**Why this matters:** This is orders of magnitude less data than traditional machine learning approaches required.

---

### 3. Understanding Language + Vision + Action Together

**Old way:** Robots either understand images OR follow commands OR move—separate systems stitched together.

**PI's way:** π0 combines three capabilities in one model:
- **Vision:** Sees the world through cameras
- **Language:** Understands instructions like "pick up the red cup"
- **Action:** Generates precise motor commands

**Analogy:** Instead of having a separate translator, photographer, and athlete who have to coordinate, you have one person who can see, understand instructions, and act—all seamlessly integrated.

**Technical term:** This is called a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model.

---

### 4. Flow Matching (Smooth, Continuous Movement)

This is the most technical innovation, but here's the simple version:

**The problem:** Robot movements are either:
- **Discrete:** "Move to position 1, then position 2, then position 3" (jerky, like stop-motion animation)
- **Continuous:** Smooth, flowing motion (like how humans actually move)

Dexterous tasks (folding clothes, handling delicate objects) require smooth, continuous control.

**Old AI approach:** Predict the next position, then the next, then the next (discrete steps).

**PI's approach (Flow Matching):** Instead of predicting steps, predict the *flow*—the smooth trajectory from start to finish.

**Analogy:** 
- Old way = GPS that says "turn left, go 100 feet, turn right" 
- Flow matching = GPS that draws the entire curved path and guides you smoothly along it

**Why this matters:** Dexterous manipulation (surgery, assembly, food handling) requires fluid motion, not choppy steps.

---

## The π0 → π0.5 Upgrade (Think, Then Act)

The newer model (π0.5) added a two-stage process:

**Stage 1 - High-level planning:** "What should I do?" 
→ Model thinks: "I need to pick up the cup, move it to the sink, set it down"

**Stage 2 - Low-level execution:** "How exactly do I move?"
→ Model generates precise motor commands for each subtask

**Analogy:** When you make coffee, you don't consciously think about each finger movement. You think "grab mug" and your motor system handles the details. π0.5 works similarly—high-level reasoning feeds into automatic motor execution.

---

## What They Open-Sourced

Physical Intelligence released:
- The trained model weights (the "brain" itself)
- Code to run it on common robot platforms
- Code to fine-tune it for your own tasks

**Why this matters:** Anyone with a robot and some demonstration data can now experiment with state-of-the-art robot AI without building it from scratch.

---

## The Limitations (For Healthcare Context)

What π0 **can't** do yet:

| Capability | π0 Status |
|------------|-----------|
| See the world | ✅ Yes (cameras) |
| Understand language | ✅ Yes |
| Generate smooth movements | ✅ Yes |
| **Feel pressure/texture** | ❌ No |
| **Sense force feedback** | ❌ No |
| **Understand tissue compliance** | ❌ No |

For surgical robotics, the missing piece is *touch*. π0 is like a surgeon with perfect vision who's wearing thick gloves—they can see everything but can't feel anything.

---

## The Bottom Line

Physical Intelligence's core innovations:

1. **Generalization:** One model → many robots → many tasks
2. **Data efficiency:** Hours of demos, not years of programming
3. **Integration:** Vision + language + action in one system
4. **Smooth control:** Flow matching for dexterous manipulation

The bet is that this approach—foundation models for robotics—will do for physical AI what GPT did for language AI. Whether that extends to high-stakes domains like surgery depends on solving the multimodal sensing problem (adding touch, force, proprioception).
