4. What problem or unmet need are you trying to solve? *
The current process for accessing and summarizing financial data is highly manual, fragmented across multiple systems, and prone to human error. This creates significant inefficiencies for finance and operations teams, who spend considerable time pulling, validating, and reconciling data—often leading to delays, inconsistent reporting, and missed insights. These challenges occur regularly and intensify during key reporting cycles, impacting the accuracy and timeliness of financial decision-making at both the project and leadership levels.

Challenges with the new system (e.g., inconsistent data validation, integration gaps, usability limitations, manual workarounds, etc.) compound the historic inefficiencies—such as fragmented manual data pulls and error-prone reconciliations—creating delays, inaccuracies, and user frustration each month and during ad-hoc reporting cycles. Teams now spend hours troubleshooting discrepancies, diagnosing system errors, and patching around tool limitations. We need a modern solution—a streamlined, automated reporting platform that is more than an OBIEE replacement—it's a strategic tool ensuring accuracy, reliability, and user confidence in financial reporting.

Our planned solution is a tool that delivers:
-Built-in end-to-end validation to ensure consistent, accurate results.
-Seamless integration across all data sources including legacy and cloud systems.
-A user-centric, visually intuitive interface that encourages adoption and reduces training needs.
-Strong governance, auditability, and role-based security, closing compliance and access gaps and eliminating common workarounds.
-Reporting foundation built to eliminate the issues we've already encountered

Despite ongoing efforts, teams continue to face recurring friction—every month and on demand—due to manual reconciliations, workarounds, multiple system report reconciliation, and system inconsistencies that delay outputs and erode user trust. This fractured process compromises decision-making by relying on unreliable data and delayed insights. In contrast an automated financial reporting platform (similar to OBIEE) would dramatically improve data integrity through built-in validation, enable real-time visibility for operations and leadership, and eliminate repetitive manual effort—freeing teams to concentrate on strategic analysis and accelerating business performance.

5. Who is most affected by this problem? Select up to three groups most affected by this problem. If only one group is primarily impacted, feel free to select only one. *
Please select at most 3 options.
[ ] Patients
[ ] Clinicians (e.g., doctors, nurses)
[ ] Caregivers
[x] Healthcare administrators
[ ] Payers (i.e., insurers)
[ ] Pharmaceutical companies
[x] Research administrators, finance teams, operations leadership, and executive decision makers

6. How frequently do those most affected by this problem experience it (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, etc.)? *
Monthly during financial close and monthly reporting cycles.
Daily or as-needed when quick, ad-hoc reports are required for decision-making or status updates.

7. How acutely is this problem felt by those impacted (e.g., hours spent, cost per day / visit / incident, potential revenue lost, delays in care)? *
By automating reporting, we cut report turnaround from 2-5 hours down to ~0.5-1 hour—a ~2.75-hour reduction per report.
At 79 reports per month and $51/hour labor cost: ~217 hours saved per month, or about $11K monthly
Over a year, this totals ~$133K in labor savings, plus improved timeliness, reduced error risk, and reallocation of staff to value-added work and a significant productivity gain.
Beyond cost efficiency, this also improves reporting timeliness, reduces risk of error, and enables staff to focus on strategic priorities.

## Proposed Solution(s)
If you have thoughts on how to solve this issue—great. If not, no problem. This section gives you space to describe what's currently being done (if anything) and your ideas for doing it better.

8. Is Cedars-Sinai currently doing anything to solve this problem today (e.g., technology or vendors)? If so, what is or is not working?
Yes, there have been efforts to resolve issues, enhance reports, improve systems but despite these initiatives, the outcomes have been less than optimal at the departmental/day-to-day level.

However, at the department and day-to-day user level, these tools have delivered incremental improvements rather than transformational change. While they reduce certain manual processes, users are still encountering slow system performance, increased volume of reports and data, and fragmented workflows that demand additional time to sift through and reconcile information. Moreover, structural challenges around validation, integration, and reconciliation persist unchanged even in automated environments

In summary, although Cedars-Sinai's reflect genuine progress, the current systems haven't fully resolved the root causes of reporting inefficiency or restored confidence in data integrity. A comprehensive, end-to-end reporting platform remains essential to deliver accuracy, end-user usability, and strategic finance support at scale.

9. How is this problem being addressed today in the market, if at all (i.e., any known vendors or industry approaches)?
Organizations today commonly rely on platforms like Kuali Research, PeopleSoft Grants Management, Streamlyne Research (eRA), InfoEd Global, and consulting firms like Bad Rabbit to manage post-award grant financial workflows. These solutions deliver strong capabilities in award administration, compliance tracking, integration with ERPs, and retrospective reporting. For example, Kuali offers budgeting and compliance modules, PeopleSoft handles project cost control and billing, Streamlyne provides over 130 out-of-the-box reports and dashboards, InfoEd supports burn-rate monitoring and workflow automation, and Bad Rabbit specializes in integrating and enhancing reporting infrastructure. However, each of these remains largely transactional, lacks built-in forecasting, predictive spend modeling, or dashboards designed for proactive decision-making—not to mention many still require costly vendor engagements or extensive scripting to tailor workflows.

In contrast, our tool delivers real-time predictive forecasts, embedded spend validation, and intuitive visual summaries, all fully integrated with institutional ERP systems built to work with Cedars-Sinai system. This unified, configurable platform eliminates the need for costly external consultants or manual reconciliation processes. As a result, it unlocks substantial savings by replacing vendor-dependent deployments and reducing license and implementation expenses, while also empowering finance teams with faster, more accurate forecasting and operational decision support.

10. How would you characterize the limitations of these current solutions, if any?
Current solutions offer significant automation and consolidation capabilities but still have their own limitations such as deployment complexity, integration friction, fragmented outputs, heavy customization, and reliance on community-driven updates leaving gaps in real-world usability at the departmental level. The dominant challenge is that these systems are largely transactional an would still not address our pain points of slow performance, validation gaps, and persistent manual reconciliation.

11. What is your proposed solution and how does it work?
The COPPA Post Award Plan to Spend Projections Tool is a tailored platform designed to streamline post-award financial management by integrating real-time ERP data with grant budgets and customizable spend rules. It simplifies the Plan-to-Spend (PTS) process which many organizations currently handle manually by auto-generating monthly expenditure forecasts, tracking trends against award balances, and visualizing future spend scenarios.

Unlike typical grant systems that produce dashboards and reports without robust financial forecasting, our tool supports continuous compliance with spending rules, provides dynamic updates as spending evolves, and delivers focused insights rather than data overload. By embedding validation workflows, role-based access controls, and seamless ERP/finance system connectors, it reduces reconciliation effort and increases accuracy making post-award financial reporting proactive, transparent, and strategic.

12. How is your proposed solution better than what exists today at Cedars-Sinai or in the market?
The COPPA Post Award Plan to Spend Projections Tool represents a strategic advancement in grant financial management, combining real-time ERP integration, predictive spend forecasting, embedded compliance logic, and tailored visual insights into a unified platform. Unlike current Cedars-Sinai systems and typical market grant management tools, which often focus on static dashboards, fragmented data workflows, or basic document tracking. It delivers fully synchronized financial projections and compliance checks that adapt to institutional spending rules.

The COPPA Post Award Plan to Spend Projections Tool excels in four key areas:
1. Predictive Forecasting vs. Static Reporting: Generates trend-based spend projections and variance modeling rather than just budget-to-actual snapshots.
2. Deep Hybrid Integration: Offers seamless linkage to legacy ERPs and research finance systems eliminating data silos and reconciliation gaps still present at Cedars-Sinai and many vendors
3. Actionable Visual Output: Prioritizes focused dashboards and insight summaries over high-volume reports, reducing cognitive load on users.
4. Built-in Validation & Compliance: Enforces grant-specific controls and audit trails without heavy scripting surpassing limitations seen in other systems.

The COPPA Post Award Plan to Spend Projections Tool isn't just an improvement, it's transformative. It directly tackles the persistent pain points in post-award grant management: data fragmentation, delayed insight, manual reconciliation, and compliance risk. By unifying forecasting, integration, and governance within a single, configurable interface, this tool delivers faster, more reliable decision-making and restores user confidence in post-award financial integrity.

## Business Value Proposition
Here, we want to understand who the end users or customers might be and how your idea could deliver value—whether clinical, operational, or financial. Don't worry about perfect estimates—directionally helpful is just fine.

13. Who are the target users and/or customers of your proposed solution?
[ ] Patients
[x] Individual clinicians (e.g., doctors, nurses)
[x] Healthcare organizations (e.g., hospitals, clinics, medical groups)
[ ] Payers (i.e., insurers)
[ ] Pharmaceutical companies
[x] post-award research administrators, finance/accounting staff, grants and sponsored programs managers

14. What are the key benefits to each of the end users or customers identified above?
Finance and Research Administration Staff (e.g. sponsored programs & budget officers) benefit from COPPA's embedded validation rules and real-time, award-specific forecasting. Instead of piecing together data from transactional systems or relying on static burn-rate dashboards, COPPA automates forecast-to-actual reconciliation and proactively flags variances. This reduces manual reconciliation work, lowers audit risk, minimizes vendor dependency, and speeds up monthly forecasting cycles.

Principal Investigators (PIs) and Department/School Leadership gain clarity and confidence through intuitive dashboards that display projected spend trends and award balances at both granular and aggregated levels. Current systems lack dynamic scenario modeling or drill-down visual insights. In contrast, COPPA enables scenario-based planning tied to actual ERP financials allowing PIs and analysts to adjust projections quickly, anticipate funding needs, and avoid deficits/overspending.

15. What potential impact would your solution have on clinical outcomes or operational metrics?
By embedding real-time, predictive financial forecasting, the COPPA tool enhances operational decision-making directly. As seen in healthcare organizations, financial analytics and agile forecasting enable optimal resource allocation, better staffing, and improved budgeting responsiveness in the face of evolving costs and patient volumes. COPPA extends this capability to post-award grant funding, allowing institutions to project future spend trends, model funding scenarios, and avoid budget overruns. This financial clarity supports operational stability, ensuring teams can anticipate constraints and reallocate funding proactively, rather than reacting to variance after the fact.

On clinical and quality metrics, improved financial predictability and administrative efficiency enable institutions to invest in patient-facing services and systems that directly impact care. Literature links stronger financial performance to higher quality of care—as financially stable hospitals are better positioned to maintain equipment, hire skilled staff, and invest in patient safety infrastructure.

This tool will help achieve that stability by reducing vendor dependency, minimizing manual reconciliation errors, and driving efficiencies across grant-funded projects. This contributes to more reliable funding flows, fewer administrative delays, and ultimately supports smoother program execution, delivering indirect benefits such as improved patient throughput, reduced compliance risk, and better alignment between finance and clinical priorities.

18. Are there any regulatory or privacy considerations you anticipate?
While the COPPA Post Award Plan to Spend Projections Tool is designed to meet critical grant compliance frameworks (such as NIH policy, Uniform Guidance, and Single Audit Act), a few regulatory and security considerations require further planning and diligence. Institutions must conduct and document full Security Risk Analyses (SRAs), which regulators are increasingly enforcing in the post-2024 OCR environment. Ensuring COPPA users complete in-depth SRAs and periodic audits, rather than cursory checks, is essential. Additionally, crafting robust vendor oversight mechanisms around COPPA's third-party integrations and AI modules is critical to stay aligned with evolving HIPAA and OCR expectations.

On the privacy front, deploying COPPA within PHI-handling environments brings specific challenges. Effective role-based access control, encryption (at rest and in transit), multi-factor authentication, and audit logging are necessary. The platform must scale to full HIPAA compliance, include user training protocols, emergency contingency plans, and documented incident response workflows.

Additionally, the solution must support data retention, audit trail preservation, and identity access governance aligned with federal mandates without losing access to important data/information, a common pain point in ERP-integrated systems where fine-grained access control is complex to configure.

By proactively engaging in oversight, role-based access configuration reviews and routine audits, this tool can uphold both federal grant compliance and HIPAA-aligned privacy protections. This approach not only mitigates regulatory exposure but also builds organizational trust as a secure, compliant financial planning platform.

## Early Opportunity Evidence
If you've already explored the idea further and have supporting data—this is the place to share it.

19. Do you have any early data, validation, or research supporting this idea? Please include links to any relevant information.
The COPPA Post Award Plan to Spend Projections Tool has undergone a successful pilot within Cedars-Sinai's Cancer department, demonstrating its core functionality in a real-world setting. Finance and research teams reported strong alignment between COPPA's real-time projected spend and actual expenditure, which enabled earlier variance detection and reduced the need for manual reconciliation. Users, including departmental administrators and PIs, have mentioned there is improved clarity and confidence in predicting award balances and planning future spend scenarios. While this internal validation is unpublished, it reflects meaningful operational improvement and user acceptance in a complex research environment.

Broader industry and academic studies reinforce the value proposition COPPA embodies. Institutions like Tufts University practice integrated "plan-to-spend" forecasting to enhance grant financial management, closely mirroring COPPA's approach (viceprovost.tufts.edu).

Our pilot at Cedars-Sinai Cancer confirms this resource as a real-world tool, showing measurable improvements in forecast accuracy, user trust, and efficiency. This is further reinforced by broader research demonstrating the effectiveness of predictive analytics in financial planning.
