# RYGHT, INC. AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INVENTION ASSIGNMENT AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

As a condition of my employment with Ryght, Inc. (the “Company”), and in consideration of my employment with the Company and my receipt of the compensation now and hereafter paid to me by the Company, I agree to the following provisions of this At-Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement (this “Agreement”).

## 1. AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT

I UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY IS FOR NO SPECIFIED TERM AND CONSTITUTES “AT-WILL” EMPLOYMENT. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS UNAUTHORIZED AND NOT VALID UNLESS IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT OR CEO OF THE COMPANY. ACCORDINGLY, I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP MAY BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE OR FOR ANY OR NO CAUSE, AT MY OPTION OR AT THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE. I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMPANY MAY MODIFY JOB TITLES, SALARIES, AND BENEFITS FROM TIME TO TIME AS IT DEEMS NECESSARY.

## 2. CONFIDENTIALITY

### A. Definition of Company Confidential Information.
I understand that "Company Confidential Information” means information (including any and all combinations of individual items of information) that the Company has or will develop, acquire, create, compile, discover or own, that has value in or to the Company's business which is not generally known and which the Company wishes to maintain as confidential. Company Confidential Information includes both information disclosed by the Company to me, and information developed or learned by me during the course of my employment with the Company. Company Confidential Information also includes all information of which the unauthorized disclosure could be detrimental to the interests of the Company, whether or not such information is identified as Company Confidential Information. By example, and without limitation, Company Confidential Information includes any and all non-public information that relates to the actual or anticipated business and/or products, research or development of the Company, or to the Company's technical data, trade secrets, or know-how, including, but not limited to, research, product plans, or other information regarding the Company's products or services and markets therefor, customer lists and customers (including, but not limited to, customers of the Company on which I called or with which I may become acquainted during the term of my employment), software, developments, inventions, discoveries, ideas, processes, formulas, technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing, finances, and other business information disclosed by the Company either directly or indirectly in writing, orally or by drawings or inspection of premises, parts, equipment, or other Company property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company Confidential Information shall not include any such information which I can establish (i) was publicly known or made generally available prior to the time of disclosure by the Company to me; (ii) becomes publicly known or made generally available after disclosure by the Company to me through no wrongful action or omission by me; or (iii) is in my rightful possession, without confidentiality obligations, at the time of disclosure by the Company as shown by my then-contemporaneous written records; provided that any combination of individual items of information shall not be deemed to be within any of the foregoing exceptions merely because one or more of the individual items are within such exception, unless the combination as a whole is within such exception. I understand that nothing in this Agreement limits employees' rights to discuss the terms, wages, and working conditions of their employment, as protected by applicable law.

### B. Nonuse and Nondisclosure.
I agree that during and after my employment with the Company, I will hold in the strictest confidence, and take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Company Confidential Information. I will not (i) use Company Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than for the benefit of the Company in the course of my employment, or (ii) disclose Company Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written authorization of the President, CEO, or the Board of Directors of the Company. Prior to disclosure when compelled by applicable law; I shall provide prior written notice to the President, CEO, and General Counsel of the Company (as applicable). I agree that I obtain no title to any Company Confidential Information, and that the Company retains all Confidential Information as the sole property of the Company. I understand that my unauthorized use or disclosure of Company Confidential Information during my employment may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination and legal action by the Company. I understand that my obligations under this Section 2.B shall continue after termination of my employment and also that nothing in this Agreement prevents me from engaging in protected activity, as described in Section 14 below.

### C. Former Employer Confidential Information.
I agree that during my employment with the Company, I will not improperly use, disclose, or induce the Company to use any proprietary information or trade secrets of any former employer or other person or entity with which I have an obligation to keep such proprietary information or trade secrets in confidence. I further agree that I will not bring onto the Company's premises or transfer onto the Company's technology systems any unpublished document, proprietary information, or trade secrets belonging to any such third party unless disclosure to, and use by, the Company has been consented to in writing by such third party and the Company.

### D. Third Party Information.
I recognize that the Company has received, and in the future may receive, from third parties (for example, customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, partners, and collaborators) as well as its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Associated Third Parties”), information which the Company is required to maintain and treat as confidential or proprietary information of such Associated Third Parties (“Associated Third Party Confidential Information”), and I agree to use such Associated Third Party Confidential Information only as directed by the Company and to not use or disclose such Associated Third Party Confidential Information in a manner that would violate the Company's obligations to such Associated Third Parties. By way of example, Associated Third Party Confidential Information may include the habits or practices of Associated Third Parties, the technology of Associated Third Parties, requirements of Associated Third Parties, and information related to the business conducted between the Company and such Associated Third Parties. I agree at all times during my employment with the Company and thereafter, that I owe the Company and its Associated Third Parties a duty to hold all such Associated Third Party Confidential Information in the strictest confidence, and not to use it or to disclose it to any person, firm, corporation, or other third party except as necessary in carrying out my work for the Company consistent with the Company's agreement with such Associated Third Parties. I further agree to comply with any and all Company policies and guidelines that may be adopted from time to time regarding Associated Third Parties and Associated Third Party Confidential Information. I understand that my unauthorized use or disclosure of Associated Third Party Confidential Information or violation of any Company policies during my employment may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination and legal action by the Company.

## 3. OWNERSHIP

### A. Assignment of Inventions.
As between the Company and myself, I agree that all right, title, and interest in and to any and all copyrightable material, notes, records, ideas, drawings, designs, logos, inventions, improvements, developments, discoveries and trade secrets conceived, discovered, authored, invented, developed or reduced to practice by me, solely or in collaboration with others, during the period of time I am in the employ of the Company (including during my off-duty hours), or with the use of the Company's equipment, supplies, facilities, or Company Confidential Information, and any copyrights, patents, trade secrets, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating to the foregoing, except as provided in Section 3.G below (collectively, “Inventions”), are the sole property of the Company. I also agree to promptly make full written disclosure to the Company of any Inventions, and to deliver and assign and hereby irrevocably assign fully to the Company all of my right, title and interest in and to Inventions. I agree that this assignment includes a present conveyance to the Company of ownership of Inventions that are not yet in existence. I further acknowledge that all original works of authorship that are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of and during the period of my employment with the Company and that are protectable by copyright are “works made for hire," as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act. I understand and agree that the decision whether or not to commercialize or market any Inventions is within the Company's sole discretion and for the Company's sole benefit, and that no royalty or other consideration will be due to me as a result of the Company's efforts to commercialize or market any such Inventions.

### B. Pre-Existing Materials.
I will inform the Company in writing before incorporating any inventions, discoveries, ideas, original works of authorship, developments, improvements, trade secrets and other proprietary information or intellectual property rights owned by me or in which I have an interest prior to, or separate from, my employment with the Company, including without limitation, any such inventions that meet the criteria set forth herein under Section 3.G (“Prior Inventions”) into any Invention or otherwise utilizing any such Prior Invention in the course of my employment with the Company, and the Company is hereby granted a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable worldwide license (with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses) to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, sell, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise exploit such Prior Inventions, without restriction, including, without limitation, as part of or in connection with such Invention, and to practice any method related thereto. I will not incorporate any inventions, discoveries, ideas, original works of authorship, developments, improvements, trade secrets and other proprietary information or intellectual property rights owned by any third party into any Invention without the Company's prior written permission. I have attached hereto as Exhibit A, a list describing all Prior Inventions that relate to the Company's current or anticipated business, products, or research and development or, if no such list is attached, I represent and warrant that there are no such Prior Inventions. Furthermore, I represent and warrant that if any Prior Inventions are included on Exhibit A, they will not materially affect my ability to perform all obligations under this Agreement.

### C. Moral Rights.
Any assignment to the Company of Inventions includes all rights of attribution, paternity, integrity, modification, disclosure and withdrawal, and any other rights throughout the world that may be known as or referred to as “moral rights,” “artist's rights,” “droit moral," or the like (collectively, “Moral Rights”). To the extent that Moral Rights cannot be assigned under applicable law, I hereby waive and agree not to enforce any and all Moral Rights, including, without limitation, any limitation on subsequent modification, to the extent permitted under applicable law.

### D. Maintenance of Records.
I agree to keep and maintain adequate, current, accurate, and authentic written records of all Inventions made by me (solely or jointly with others) during the term of my employment with the Company. The records will be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, electronic files, reports, or any other format that may be specified by the Company. As between the Company and myself, the records are and will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times.

### E. Further Assurances.
I agree to assist the Company, or its designee, at the Company's expense, in every proper way to secure the Company's rights in the Inventions in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, and all other instruments that the Company shall deem proper or necessary in order to apply for, register, obtain, maintain, defend, and enforce such rights, and in order to deliver, assign and convey to the Company, its successors, assigns, and nominees the sole and exclusive rights, title, and interest in and to all Inventions, and testifying in a suit or other proceeding relating to such Inventions. I further agree that my obligations under this Section 3.E shall continue after the termination of this Agreement.

### F. Attorney-in-Fact.
I agree that, if the Company is unable because of my unavailability, mental or physical incapacity, or for any other reason to secure my signature with respect to any Inventions, including, without limitation, for the purpose of applying for or pursuing any application for any United States or foreign patents or mask work or copyright registrations covering the Inventions assigned to the Company in Section 3.A, then I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on my behalf to execute and file any papers and oaths, and to do all other lawfully permitted acts with respect to such Inventions to further the prosecution and issuance of patents, copyright and mask work registrations with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me. This power of attorney shall be deemed coupled with an interest, and shall be irrevocable.

### G. Exception to Assignments.
I understand that the provisions of this Agreement requiring assignment of Inventions to the Company do not apply to any Invention that I have developed entirely on my own time without using the Company's equipment, supplies, facilities, trade secret information or Company Confidential Information (an “Other Invention") except for those Other Inventions that either (i) relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of such Other Invention to the Company's business, or actual or anticipated research or development of the Company or (ii) result from or relate to any work that I performed for the Company or to any Company Confidential Information or Inventions. I will not incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, any Other Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest into a Company product, process or service without the Company's prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if, in the course of my employment with the Company, I incorporate into a Company product, process, or service an Other Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest, I hereby grant to the Company a nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to reproduce, make derivative works of, distribute, perform, display, import, make, have made, modify, use, sell, offer to sell, and exploit in any other way such Other Invention, and to practice any method related thereto.

Without limiting Section 4.A, I represent and warrant that I have no other agreements, relationships, or commitments to any other person or entity that conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, my obligations to the Company under this Agreement, or my ability to become employed and perform the services for which I am being hired by the Company. I further agree that if I have signed a confidentiality agreement or similar type of agreement with any former employer or other entity, I will comply with the terms of any such agreement to the extent that its terms are lawful under applicable law. I represent and warrant that after undertaking a careful search (including searches of my computers, cell phones, electronic devices, and documents), I have returned all property and confidential information belonging to all prior employers (and/or other third parties I have performed services for in accordance with the terms of my applicable agreement). Moreover, I agree to fully indemnify the Company, its directors, officers, agents, employees, investors, shareholders, administrators, affiliates, divisions, subsidiaries, predecessor and successor corporations, and assigns for all verdicts, judgments, settlements, and other losses incurred by any of them resulting from my breach of my obligations under any agreement with a third party to which I am a party or obligation to which I am bound, as well as any reasonable attorneys' fees and costs if the plaintiff is the prevailing party in such an action, except as prohibited by law.

In the event that the applicable court or arbitrator does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, I and the Company agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

## 11. AUDIT

I acknowledge that I have no reasonable expectation of privacy in any Company Electronic Media Equipment or Company Electronic Media Systems. All information, data, and messages created, received, sent, or stored in Company Electronic Media Equipment or Company Electronic Media Systems are, at all times, the property of the Company. As such, the Company has the right to audit and search all such items and systems, without further notice to me, to ensure that the Company is licensed to use the software on the Company's devices in compliance with the Company's software licensing policies, to ensure compliance with the Company's policies, and for any other business-related purposes in the Company's sole discretion. I understand that I am not permitted to add any unlicensed, unauthorized, or non-compliant applications to the Company's technology systems, including, without limitation, open source or free software not authorized by the Company, and that I shall refrain from copying unlicensed software onto the Company's technology systems or using non-licensed software or websites. I understand that it is my responsibility to comply with the Company's policies governing use of the Company's documents and the internet, email, telephone, and technology systems to which I will have access in connection with my employment. In addition, as to any personal Electronic Media Equipment or personal Electronic Media Systems or other personal property that I have used for Company purposes, I agree that the Company may have reasonable access to such personal Electronic Media Equipment or personal Electronic Media Systems or other personal property to review, retrieve, destroy, or ensure the permanent deletion of Company information from such equipment or systems or property or take such other actions that are needed to protect the Company or Company property, as determined by the Company reasonably and in good faith.

I am aware that the Company has or may acquire software and systems that are capable of monitoring and recording all Company network traffic to and from any Company Electronic Media Equipment or Company Electronic Media Systems. The Company reserves the right to access, review, copy, and delete any of the information, data, or messages accessed through Company Electronic Media Equipment or Company Electronic Media Systems, with or without notice to me and/or in my absence. This includes, but is not limited to, all e-mail messages sent or received, all website visits, all chat sessions, all news group activity (including groups visited, messages read, and postings by me), and all file transfers into and out of the Company's internal networks. The Company further reserves the right to retrieve previously deleted messages from e-mail or voicemail and monitor usage of the Internet, including websites visited and any information I have downloaded. In addition, the Company may review Internet and technology systems activity and analyze usage patterns, and may choose to publicize this data to assure that technology systems are devoted to legitimate business purposes.

## 12. ARBITRATION AND EQUITABLE RELIEF

### A. Arbitration.
IN CONSIDERATION OF MY CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY, ITS PROMISE TO ARBITRATE ALL EMPLOYMENT-RELATED DISPUTES WITH ME, AND MY RECEIPT OF THE COMPENSATION, PAY RAISES AND OTHER BENEFITS PAID TO ME BY THE COMPANY, AT PRESENT AND IN THE FUTURE, I AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL CONTROVERSIES, CLAIMS, OR DISPUTES THAT I MAY HAVE WITH THE COMPANY (INCLUDING ANY COMPANY EMPLOYEE, OFFICER, DIRECTOR, TRUSTEE, SHAREHOLDER OR BENEFIT PLAN OF THE COMPANY, IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH OR OTHERWISE), ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR RESULTING FROM MY EMPLOYMENT OR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY OR THE TERMINATION OF MY EMPLOYMENT OR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (THE “FAA”) AND THAT THE FAA SHALL GOVERN AND APPLY TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITH FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. I AGREE THAT I MAY ONLY COMMENCE AN ACTION IN ARBITRATION, OR ASSERT COUNTERCLAIMS IN AN ARBITRATION, ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND, THUS, I HEREBY WAIVE MY RIGHT TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION(S) AGAINST THE COMPANY. DISPUTES THAT I AGREE TO ARBITRATE, AND THEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, INCLUDE ANY STATUTORY CLAIMS UNDER LOCAL, STATE, OR FEDERAL LAW, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT, THE WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION ACT, THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT, THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT, CLAIMS UNDER ILLINOIS STATE LAW, CLAIMS RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT STATUS, CLASSIFICATION AND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY, CLAIMS OF WRONGFUL TERMINATION, BREACH OF CONTRACT, AND ANY OTHER STATUTORY OR COMMON LAW CLAIMS. I ALSO AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, BUT NOT DISPUTES ABOUT THE ENFORCEABILITY, REVOCABILITY OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE OR ANY PORTION HEREOF OR THE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING WAIVER HEREIN. WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS THAT I MAY HAVE AGAINST THE COMPANY, AND DISPUTES THAT I AGREE TO ARBITRATE, I HEREBY EXPRESSLY AGREE TO WAIVE, AND DO WAIVE, ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALSO APPLIES TO ANY DISPUTES THAT THE COMPANY MAY HAVE WITH ME. I UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES ME TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS THAT CANNOT BE ARBITRATED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT.

### B. Procedure.
I AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY JAMS PURSUANT TO ITS EMPLOYMENT ARBITRATION RULES & PROCEDURES (THE "JAMS RULES"), WHICH ARE AVAILABLE AT http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/ AND FROM HUMAN RESOURCES, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE JAMS RULES SHALL NOT CONTRADICT OR OTHERWISE ALTER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE BELOW COST SHARING PROVISION AND SECTION 13.B BELOW, AS APPLICABLE. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR WHO SHALL BE A FORMER FEDERAL OR STATE COURT JUDGE. THE ARBITRATION SHALL APPLY THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH RULES CONFLICT WITH THE JAMS RULES. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PARTIES TO THE ARBITRATION SHALL EACH PAY AN EQUAL SHARE OF THE COSTS AND EXPENSES OF SUCH ARBITRATION (“ARBITRATION COSTS”) AND UNDERSTAND THAT EACH PARTY SHALL SEPARATELY PAY ITS RESPECTIVE ATTORNEYS' FEES, EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, INCLUDING IN SUCH EVENT THAT AN APPLICABLE STATUTE PROVIDES THAT A PARTY MAY RECOVER SUCH ARBITRATION COSTS OR ATTORNEYS' FEES (IN WHICH CASE, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AWARD ARBITRATION COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES IN THE ARBITRATOR'S DISCRETION). IN THE EVENT THAT JAMS FAILS, REFUSES, OR OTHERWISE DOES NOT ENFORCE THE AFOREMENTIONED ARBITRATION COSTS SHARING PROVISION, EITHER PARTY MAY COMMENCE AN ACTION TO RECOVER SUCH AMOUNTS AGAINST THE NON-PAYING PARTY IN COURT AND THE NON-PAYING PARTY SHALL REIMBURSE THE MOVING PARTY FOR THE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTION. I AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL CONSIDER AND SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO DECIDE ANY MOTIONS BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND/OR ADJUDICATION, AND MOTIONS TO DISMISS, PRIOR TO ANY ARBITRATION HEARING. I AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ISSUE A WRITTEN DECISION ON THE MERITS. I ALSO AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO AWARD ANY REMEDIES AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. I AGREE THAT THE DECREE OR AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AS A FINAL AND BINDING JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. I AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL APPLY SUBSTANTIVE ILLINOIS LAW TO ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAW. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE JAMS RULES CONFLICT WITH SUBSTANTIVE ILLINOIS LAW, ILLINOIS LAW SHALL TAKE PRECEDENCE. I AGREE THAT ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN NEW CASTLE COUNTY, ILLINOIS.

### C. Remedy.
EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW OR PROVIDED BY THIS AGREEMENT, ARBITRATION SHALL BE THE SOLE, EXCLUSIVE AND FINAL REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN ME AND THE COMPANY. ACCORDINGLY, NEITHER I NOR THE COMPANY WILL BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE OR PARTICIPATE IN A COURT ACTION REGARDING CLAIMS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION.

### D. Availability of Injunctive Relief.
I AGREE THAT ANY PARTY MAY ALSO PETITION THE COURT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF WHERE EITHER PARTY ALLEGES OR CLAIMS A VIOLATION OF THE AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INVENTION ASSIGNMENT, AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN ME AND THE COMPANY OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT REGARDING TRADE SECRETS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR NONSOLICITATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT ANY BREACH OR THREATENED BREACH OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE INJURY AND THAT MONEY DAMAGES WILL NOT PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE REMEDY THEREFOR AND BOTH PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN INJUNCTION WITHOUT POSTING OF A BOND. IN THE EVENT EITHER PARTY SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, THE PREVAILING PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER REASONABLE COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE PREVAILING PARTY IN THE FINAL JUDGMENT, IF ANY. SUCH ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS SHALL BE RECOVERABLE ON WRITTEN DEMAND AT ANY TIME, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRIOR TO ENTRY OF A FINAL JUDGMENT, IF ANY, BY THE COURT, AND MUST BE PAID WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER DEMAND OR ELSE SUCH AMOUNTS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE MAXIMUM STATUTORY RATE.

### E. Administrative Relief.
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT PROHIBIT ME FROM PURSUING AN ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIM WITH A LOCAL, STATE, OR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE BODY OR GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT IS AUTHORIZED TO ENFORCE OR ADMINISTER LAWS RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION, THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OR THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION BOARD. THIS AGREEMENT DOES, HOWEVER, PRECLUDE ME FROM PURSUING A COURT ACTION REGARDING ANY SUCH CLAIM, EXCEPT AS PERMITTED BY LAW.

### F. Voluntary Nature of Agreement.
I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT I AM EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT ANY DURESS OR UNDUE INFLUENCE BY THE COMPANY OR ANYONE ELSE. I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT I HAVE ASKED ANY QUESTIONS NEEDED FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THE TERMS, CONSEQUENCES, AND BINDING EFFECT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND FULLY UNDERSTAND IT, INCLUDING THAT I AM WAIVING MY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. FINALLY, I AGREE THAT I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF AN ATTORNEY OF MY CHOICE BEFORE SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT.

## 13. MISCELLANEOUS

### A. Governing Law; Consent to Personal Jurisdiction.
With the exception of the arbitration requirements set forth herein, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to Illinois's conflicts of law rules that may result in the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than Illinois. To the extent that any lawsuit is permitted under this Agreement, I hereby expressly consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Illinois for any lawsuit filed against me by the Company.

### B. Waiver of Trial by Jury.
TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY LAWSUIT IS PERMITTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, I IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE MY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING MY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

### C. Assignability.
This Agreement will be binding upon my heirs, executors, assigns, administrators, and other legal representatives, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns. The Associated Third Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement with respect to my obligations in Section 2.D. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any successor to all or substantially all of the Company's relevant assets, whether by merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, sale of assets or stock, or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company's successors and assigns are authorized to enforce the Company's rights under this Agreement.

### D. Entire Agreement.
This Agreement, together with the Exhibits herein and any executed written offer letter between me and the Company, to the extent such materials are not in conflict with this Agreement, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and me with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior written and oral agreements, discussions, or representations between us, including, but not limited to, any representations made during my interview(s) or relocation negotiations. I represent and warrant that I am not relying on any statement or representation not contained in this Agreement. Any subsequent change or changes in my duties, salary, compensation, conditions or any other terms of my employment will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.

### E. Headings.
Headings are used in this Agreement for reference only and shall not be considered when interpreting this Agreement.

### F. Severability.
If a court or other body of competent jurisdiction finds, or the parties to this Agreement mutually believe, any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

### G. Modification, Waiver.
No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in a writing signed by the President or CEO of the Company and me. Waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

### H. Survivorship.
The rights and obligations of the parties to this Agreement will survive termination of my employment with the Company.

## 14. PROTECTED ACTIVITY NOT PROHIBITED

I understand that nothing in this Agreement limits or prohibits me from filing and/or pursuing a charge or complaint with, or otherwise communicating or cooperating with or participating in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by, any federal, state or local government agency or commission, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the National Labor Relations Board (“Government Agencies”), including disclosing documents or other information as permitted by law. In addition, I understand that nothing in this Agreement, including its definition of Company Confidential Information, prevents me from discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that I have reason to believe is unlawful. Notwithstanding the preceding, I agree to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of any Company trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential information that does not involve unlawful acts in the workplace or the activity otherwise protected herein. I further understand that I am not permitted to disclose the Company's attorney-client privileged communications or attorney work product. In addition, I hereby acknowledge that the Company has provided me with notice in compliance with the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 regarding immunity from liability for limited disclosures of trade secrets. The full text of the notice is attached in Exhibit B. Finally, I understand that nothing in this Agreement, including its definition of Company Confidential Information, (i) limits employees' rights to discuss or disclose wages, benefits, or terms and conditions of employment as protected by applicable law, including any rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or (ii) otherwise impairs employees from assisting other Company employees and/or former employees in the exercise of their rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.

## EXHIBIT C
# RYGHT, INC. CONFLICT OF INTEREST GUIDELINES

It is the policy of Ryght, Inc. to conduct its affairs in strict compliance with the letter and spirit of the law and to adhere to the highest principles of business ethics. Accordingly, all officers, employees, and independent contractors must avoid activities that are in conflict, or give the appearance of being in conflict, with these principles and with the interests of the Company. The following are potentially compromising situations that must be avoided:

1.  Revealing confidential information to outsiders or misusing confidential information. Unauthorized divulging of information is a violation of this policy whether or not for personal gain and whether or not harm to the Company is intended. (The At-Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement elaborates on this principle and is a binding agreement.)
2.  Accepting or offering substantial gifts, excessive entertainment, favors, or payments that may be deemed to constitute undue influence or otherwise be improper or embarrassing to the Company.
3.  Participating in civic or professional organizations that might involve divulging confidential information of the Company.
4.  Initiating or approving personnel actions affecting reward or punishment of employees or applicants where there is a family relationship or is or appears to be a personal or social involvement.
5.  Initiating or approving any form of personal or social harassment of employees.
6.  Investing or holding outside directorship in suppliers, customers, or competing companies, including financial speculations, where such investment or directorship might influence in any manner a decision or course of action of the Company.
7.  Borrowing from or lending to employees, customers, or suppliers.
8.  Acquiring real estate of interest to the Company.
9.  Improperly using or disclosing to the Company any proprietary information or trade secrets of any other employer or other person or entity with whom obligations of confidentiality exist.
10. Unlawfully discussing prices, costs, customers, sales, or markets with competing companies or their employees.
11. Making any unlawful agreement with distributors with respect to prices.
12. Improperly using or authorizing the use of any inventions that are the subject of patent claims of any other person or entity.
13. Engaging in any conduct that is not in the best interest of the Company.

Each officer, employee, and independent contractor must take every necessary action to ensure compliance with these guidelines and to bring problem areas to the attention of higher management for review. Violations of this conflict of interest policy may result in discharge without warning.

Nothing in these guidelines is intended to limit employees' rights to discuss the terms, wages, and working conditions of their employment, as protected by applicable law, including any rights an employee may have under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. Also, nothing in these guidelines limits or prohibits employees from filing a charge or complaint with, or otherwise communicating or cooperating with or participating in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by, any federal, state or local government agency or commission, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the National Labor Relations Board (“Government Agencies"), including disclosing documents or other information as permitted by law, without giving notice to, or receiving authorization from, the Company. Notwithstanding, in making any such disclosures or communications, employees must take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of any information that may constitute Company Confidential Information to any parties other than the Government Agencies. Employees may not disclose the Company's attorney-client privileged communications or attorney work product.
