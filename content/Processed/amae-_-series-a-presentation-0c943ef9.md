### Key Highlights
1.  Amae patients require **lifelong care** as SMI is a chronic condition
2.  Amae has a **far lower cost structure** than incumbents offering similar services due to better technology, lower indirect costs and non-union labor
3.  Amae generates **significant cash flow** across multiple reimbursement strategies

# Every clinic we launch becomes a new data hub

### Amae Health Clinics
Amae clinics serve as key data collection sites that inform Amae Institute's AI models.

**Patient Care:**
*   Each patient spends >500 hours a year in Amae's care
*   This enables Amae to build the largest dataset for SMI patients

**Data Collection:**
*   Genomics
*   Blood tissue samples
*   Metabolic labs
*   EHR data
*   Prior medical records
*   Claims records
*   Voice recording
*   Measurement-based care

### Amae Institute
Amae Institute is our academic research & AI technology platform that enhances care delivery.

**Research:**
*   Signed research collaboration with UCLA Semel Institute of Neuroscience to analyze patient data from Amae clinics
    *   Affiliation: UCLA Health

**AI Utilization:**
*   Accurate prescribing -> reduced total cost of care -> higher revenue to Amae via shared savings
*   Care efficiency = higher contribution margins

| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Customer Issue** | SMI patients are amongst the most expensive members for health plans |             | Hospitals lose significant amounts of money on complex SMI patients |

# Testimonials

"I am grateful to Amae Health for the transformation I've witnessed over the past year. With Dr. Scott Fears' guidance, our son has found ways to live with and even to overcome many of the challenges he's been facing. He values the insights Dr. Fears brings to their conversations.

Our son has committed to the medication regimen and the recommendations he's received—from dietary adjustments to engaging in community activities, social interactions, and physical fitness.

The Amae caregiver meetings, especially the family support sessions led by Dr. Gary Tsai, have amplified our empathy for others in similar situations and has fostered hope.

We thank the clinic for their care and for making such a positive impact on our lives."

"The people at Amae are very friendly and supportive. I've learned a lot of new coping skills and ways to control my intrusive thoughts. With the health coach, I've learned about nutritional foods and getting exercise. With the treatment and the medication, I'm getting better."

"I'm a sister of a member at Amae. I felt immediate relief from the beginning of our first visit to their facility. The staff is incredibly supportive, caring, and immediately follows up when needed. This is unfortunately rare in the mental health field.

Though it's been less than two months since my brother has joined Amae, I've noticed significant improvement in his overall well-being. For the first time, my brother has accepted that he needs help and is willing and eager to continue to do the work at Amae. We're beyond grateful for the staff at Amae, and I'm excited for him to continue to stay on the right path."
