### Customer Problem
Over 7M US kids under 8 face delays & disabilities, with less than 10% getting timely care. Public programs have month-long wait times, and private therapy is costly. Coral Care ends the wait, offering affordable, transparent access to top providers. On the provider side, 81% of 500k pediatric specialists are underused and underpaid. Starting a private practice is costly and admin-heavy. Coral Care changes the game for both families & providers.

### Our Solution
Coral Care is a marketplace where parents can find the specialists they need for their children, and where developmental therapists can affordably and easily build their own practice using our proprietary tools.

### Competitive Advantage
Coral Care's focus on in-person, in-home multi-specialty collaborative care for the general population is unique and positioned to achieve positive outcomes for children across the U.S. With a focus on recruiting providers who work in the public sector (school districts), Coral Care helps them to establish a side hustle moonlighting in the private sector with Coral Care, uniquely solving the market supply gap.

### Business Model
Coral Care takes a 30% commission of each booking from insurance and charges providers a $100/mo platform fee. On average, we expect the lifetime revenue per family to be $13.5K, allowing us to get to $180M in projected revenue by 2028.
