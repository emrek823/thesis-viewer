In 2026, employers will face similar challenges as encountered in previous years, yet at a steeper trajectory and more severe impact. The survey results highlight the health care cost and delivery challenges confronting employers. Based on the findings of this survey, the following emerged as the top insights:

* ## 1 | Employers are facing steeper year-over-year health care cost increases, a development made clear after actual health care costs significantly exceeded employer forecasts for the second year in a row. This calls for employers to act with greater urgency than in the past.

  In 2023 and 2024, employers experienced the highest back-to-back increases in a decade, surpassing what they had projected and budgeted for. As a result, employers started 2025 at a major cost disadvantage, likely adversely impacting how 2025 full year costs will end up relative to already high budgets for the year. Against this cost paradigm, employers predict that health care cost trend for 2026 will come in at a median of 9%, which falls to 7.6% with plan design changes. Understandably, employers say their top priority in the coming year is health care costs overall, followed by affordability for their organization and affordability for employees.

  ![This series of bar charts provides the median increase in health care cost trend. It includes actual health care trend through 2024 and projections through 2026. Highlights include: actual trend in 2023 of 6.8%  above projections in 2023, actual trend of 7.5% above projections in 2024, and projections before plan design changes for 2025 and 2026 of 8.0% and 9.0% respectively. ](/-/media/bgh/images/2026-employer-health-care-strategy-survey/executive-summary/fig-1.jpg)

* ## 2 | While employers have always sought to adopt sustainable cost-containment approaches, the current unfavorable environment is a call to action for bolder moves to address health care costs.

  This year, employers have observed a number of factors that have tremendous implications for both near-term and future plan costs. More employers say that increases in obesity treatments (e.g., GLP-1s) are driving health care costs. In addition, employers reported an increase in the prevalence of cancer and higher utilization of mental health services. These and other market elements combine to drive up both the unit cost and utilization of health care services. Employers and employees must work together to address affordability in a multitude of ways.
* For example, employers must assess the effectiveness of benefit provisions, programs and vendors offered, eliminating those that deliver less value, while employees can find cost-effective ways to get their recommended screenings and immunizations and use health plan resources and navigation tools to find providers that deliver high-value care.

  ![This series of stacked bar charts indicates the percentage of employers experiencing and anticipating specific health and well-being trends in 2025. 79% of employers are currently experiencing increased member utilization of obesity treatments (and another 15% are anticipating seeing an impact). 74% of employers are currently seeing an impact of higher prevalence of cancers in their population (and another 17% are anticipating). 73% of employers are currently seeing an impact of increase in services to treat mental health and substance use orders (and another 17% are anticipating). 64% of employers are currently seeing an impact of higher chronic condition management needs (and another 30% are anticipating). 44% of employers are currently seeing an impact of higher prevalence of autoimmune conditions (and another 23% are anticipating).](/-/media/bgh/images/2026-employer-health-care-strategy-survey/executive-summary/fig-2.jpg)

* ## 3 | Employers are seeing an increase in utilization of costly obesity medications, which play a role in overall health care cost increases. As a result, many employers are implementing prior authorizations and clinical oversight to address appropriateness and optimize outcomes. However, the high price of these popular medications continues to present a challenge.

  As seen in Figure 2, 79% of employers are currently seeing an increase in the utilization of obesity medications, and an additional 15% are anticipating seeing an increase in the future. As discussed later in this report, the percent of employers covering GLP-1s for conditions other than diabetes will stagnate as employers try to stabilize their health care costs. More employers covering GLP-1s for obesity will place requirements such as prior authorization, participation in a weight management program and obtaining the prescription from a specific provider in order to ensure appropriateness and optimize outcomes for the patient and the plan.
    
    
  Many employers face challenges when seeking to implement obesity management protocols; rebates related to GLP-1s are either reduced or eliminated under certain circumstances. As such, employers will need to require their vendor partners to deliver sustainable, cost-effective financial models for this class of medications or enable employers to implement utilization strategies of their choosing and receive the rebates earned.

  ![This bar chart indicates the requirements in place among employers offering coverage for GLP-1s for obesity. 90% require prior authorization. 54% require participation in weight management programs. 48% require a particular BMI threshold and/or comorbidities beyond FDA-indication.](/-/media/bgh/images/2026-employer-health-care-strategy-survey/executive-summary/fig-3.jpg)

* ## 4 | A macro-level overhaul of the pharmacy supply chain is needed to address pharmaceutical costs for employers and employees. Even though a majority of employers use plan design approaches and utilize management strategies offered by their PBMs, pharmacy cost pressures are increasing, requiring more strategic approaches and systemwide reforms.

  Fallout from the current macroeconomic environment, including potential tariffs, proposed changes to Medicare and Medicaid and other dynamics at play in the pharmaceutical market, means that employers are anticipating the cost of pharmaceuticals to continue to rise. This is on top of an already burgeoning pharmacy cost situation: In 2024, 24% of health care dollars went to pharmacy expenses. Employers are anticipating an 11-12% increase in their pharmacy costs in 2025 into 2026. This is not – and has not been – a situation that can be remedied by plan design changes. Employers must immediately explore implementation of non-traditional PBM models offered by incumbents and innovators alike, which focus on increased transparency and reduced reliance on rebates. Further, systemic change—whether brought on by dramatic marketplace moves or via government intervention—is necessary to bring down pharmacy costs for employers and employees alike.

* ## 5 | U.S. health care costs are impacting multinational employers’ ability to offer benefits outside the U.S. – and global health care costs are a growing concern.

  For multinational employers, the impact of skyrocketing health care costs doesn’t stop at the U.S. border. When asked about rising U.S. health care costs’ impact on global benefits, 67% of multinational employers agree it affects what’s offered worldwide (Figure 5). When asked about their concern about controlling health care costs outside the U.S., three-quarters of multinational employers indicated some level of concern; 34% have the strongest level of concern. Cancer, musculoskeletal conditions, cardiovascular issues and diabetes were listed as cost drivers of concern worldwide.

  ![This figure is a stacked bar chart that indicates how significant of an impact rising health care costs are going to have on global benefits. 7% indicate a very significant impact. 21% indicate a significant impact. 16% indicate a somewhat significant impact. 23% indicate a slight impact. 24% indicate no impact. 9% didn't know.](/-/media/bgh/images/2026-employer-health-care-strategy-survey/executive-summary/fig-5.jpg)

* ## 6 | Employers need to increase their focus on value while driving change to improve the quality of care that their employees receive. Crucial to this effort: Employers holding their vendors increasingly accountable for outcomes and tasking them with bringing forward bold ways to improve care while strengthening the employee experience.

  By ramping up their focus on value-driven strategies and models, employers have a number of opportunities to improve the quality of care. Navigation to higher quality providers, improved transparency of quality data and coordination of integrated care teams top the list (Figure 6). However, these actions are dependent on partners’ ability to bring forward effective and bold ways to promote and enable value-based care.
    
    
  As discussed later in the report (Figure 3.4), value-driven strategies include various approaches: centers of excellence, advanced primary care models and adoption of high-performance network models, including those offered through alternative health plans. While the number of employers deploying these strategies remains stable, opportunities exist to improve relevance and reach of these programs through broader enrollment and utilization.
    
    
  While employers seek to accelerate their efforts in these areas, industry partners providing these services will need to accelerate progress in getting employees to higher value care, which can lower overall health care costs and improve experience.

  ![This bar chart indicates which actions employers believe can have a meaningful impact on the quality of care. The most commonly indicated actions were: 82% selected navigation to higher quality sites-of-care. 82% selected improved transparency of quality. 79% selected coordination of integrated care teams. 77% selected improved transparency of cost. 73% selected pursuing efforts that reduce inappropriate and unnecessary care.](/-/media/bgh/images/2026-employer-health-care-strategy-survey/executive-summary/fig-6.jpg)

* ## 7 | Cancer continues to be the top condition driving employer health care costs, made worse by a growing prevalence of cancer diagnoses and the escalating costs of treatment.

  For the fourth year in a row, cancer is the top condition driving health care cost, which is growing at an astounding rate. Accordingly, employers are doubling down on cancer prevention and screening coverage. More employers have enhanced their screening coverage, including covering alternatives to colonoscopies, expanding coverage of breast cancer screenings and removing age restrictions to preventive care coverage. Some employers are even providing personalized support to help employees understand which cancer screenings they are due for and rewarding those who follow through on recommendations. While prevention is key to getting ahead of the cancer cost curve, employers recognize that offering access to high-value treatments is also essential. About half of employers will offer a cancer COE in 2026, and another 23% are considering doing so by 2028.

  ![This series of bar charts indicates the top conditions identified by employers to be driving health care costs in 2023-2025. The percentages reflect the percentage of employers that indicated a condition was one of the top three conditions driving health care costs. The most common (in 2023-2025) was cancer (selected by 88% of employers in 2025). The second most common (in 2023-2025) was musculoskeletal (selected by 71% in 2025). The third most common (in 2023-2205) was cardiovascular (selected by 35% in 2025). Other commonly indicated conditions in 2025 were: diabetes (21%), mental health (18%), obesity (15%), maternity (15%) and autoimmune (11%).](/-/media/bgh/images/2026-employer-health-care-strategy-survey/executive-summary/fig-7.jpg)
