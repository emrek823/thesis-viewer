## Slide 5: Healthcare data teams waste $1M+ annually wrestling with fragmented, low-quality data

Problem
Healthcare data teams waste
$1M+ annually wrestling with
fragmented, low-quality data

Healthcare data pain points:
1.  Multiple sources: Claims, EHR, HIE, Labs
2.  Multiple formats: CSV, JSON, XML, DB, PDF
3.  Persistent quality issues: Missing, invalid,
    duplicate, referential, implausible values
4.  Missing analytics-ready features

Result: Teams spend 80% of time cleaning vs.
analyzing while wasting $1M+ per year in resources.

## Slide 6: How do you go from 1 million+ codes to analytics-ready concepts?

Problem
How do you go from 1 million+ codes to analytics-ready concepts?

**Codes (Examples):**
*   SNOMED-CT
*   ICD-10
*   LOINC
*   NDC
*   RxNorm
*   HCPCS
*   Place of Service
*   Revenue Center
*   Bill Type
*   Etc...

**Analytics-Ready Concepts (Examples):**
*   Care Settings
*   Provider Specialties
*   Services
*   Conditions
*   Procedures
*   Encounters
*   Episodes
*   Preventable Events
*   Care Transitions
*   Etc...

Why they are adopting Tuva:
*   **Speed:** Takes months to ingest and transform data into analytics on current platforms
*   **Control:** Current platforms have limited ability to customize data model to meet their needs
*   **Transparency:** Struggled to validate reporting and data quality due to lack of transparency of black box data models
