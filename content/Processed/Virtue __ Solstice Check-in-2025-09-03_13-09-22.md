### Current Hiring Strategy

- Targeting “diamonds in the rough” candidates over established companies
	- Ben: cognitive science background, non-traditional CS path, hunger and technical skills
	- Chandu: Columbia researcher without LinkedIn presence
	- Current approach: career fairs, LinkedIn/email outreach, cold outreach
- High-volume, high-touch process required
	- Hundreds of interviews conducted
	- ~12 candidates invited for multi-day in-person trials
	- Only 1 offer extended so far
- Pipeline challenges and nuances of hiring
	- Recruiters less effective than internal sourcing
	- Avoiding big tech/established logos due to cultural incompatibility
	- Some venture-backed healthcare companies appear inflated despite fundraising success

### Talent Pool Opportunities

- Target non-obvious backgrounds and schools
	- UChicago, Georgia Tech, UT Austin candidates showing promise
	- Chemical engineers from drug discovery platforms
	- AI engineers in pharma frustrated by 5-10 year drug development timelines
- Early-career professionals seeking faster impact than traditional biotech allows
- Campus-based networks while candidates still accessible

### Near-term Hiring Urgency

- Multiple client onboardings approaching: Sanofi, Takeda
- Need 1-2 additional engineers within 3-4 months to serve 7-8 large enterprises
- Balancing cultural fit requirements with delivery capacity
	- Non-negotiable: willingness to grind
	- Seeking mission-aligned team members over mercenaries
	- 95% missionary, 5% mercenary mentality acceptable

### Series A Fundraising Timeline

- Target: Q1/Q2 H1 Series A
- Plan to initiate investor conversations in Q4
	- Build relationships before formal process
	- Leverage existing investor interest and previous connections
	- Aris to handle initial introductions, full team involvement later

### Next Steps

- Continue aggressive outbound hiring efforts
- Begin Series A relationship building in coming weeks
- Focus on execution: client satisfaction and team expansion
- 30-day sprint to convert pipeline and close deals
