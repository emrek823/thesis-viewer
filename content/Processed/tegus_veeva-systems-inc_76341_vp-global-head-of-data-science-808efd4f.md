**Tegus Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about Veeva and other life sciences software providers. To start off, could you please give us a quick overview of your background and experience in this space?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Sounds good. I lead the data science and customer insights group for what we call Customer Powerhouse and for all of our markets. I essentially lead a cross-functional group that covers customer engagement, data science, analytics and AI, which is building out platforms. Essentially either bringing in software companies like Veeva, implementing their solutions within our organization and rolling it out to all of the countries or partnering with some of them to build it together or building it internally ourselves.

So we do all of those three, and we work with a wide variety of software and data partners. My team builds out the data stack brings out the analytics and AI that is needed and also the customer engagement tools that we leverage. And we were fit into that on a couple of different funds, both in how we manage our sales, manager have our sales reps engage with customers and collect data and also providing us data itself that we use for different analysis.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And I know for Veeva, they have the commercial side of the business and the clinical and R&D side of the business. For you when you interact with Veeva, is it more kind of entirely on the commercial side? In the context of your role?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
So yes, in the context of my role, I partner with them on commercial and medical and to some extent, we have a joint steering committee that makes simple investment decisions across the board. So I see what we are investing in across R&D and to some extent, clinical as well.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. So, we could spend the vast majority of this call on the commercial side and maybe at the end, remember to drive us back to R&D. So I think starting on the commercial side, what are the core problems that you partner with Veeva to help solve either by purchasing software from them or by partnering to build something. I'd be curious where you find Veeva most helpful in your guy's commercial efforts?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. First, I think the first foremost, we started off working with Veeva as our core CRM system. So they help us understand our customers better and help us engage with our customers to meet their needs. That is the core underlying problem that they are helping us solve. And then there is additional components that surround it, that are also aimed towards helping us reach our customers better. Some of them are how do we organize ourselves internally as an organization.

That's more about how we structure our sales forces, how do we connect them, align them with customers.

And then also getting to know about the customers themselves, we used to use other data providers. And now we use Veeva OpenData and we were linked for some of that information, right, to understand who our customers are, where are they, contact details and all of that.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And so, on the CRM side, have you guys been working with Veeva there for a number of years?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. We have been working with Veeva for a number of years, and we've had multiple different implementations of Veeva as well. I think we went through two or three rounds of implementing Veeva in slightly different fashions.

The latest one, I think, is the one that we've implemented globally across the board starting 2015, '16. And all of our organization essentially was implemented onto one common global instance of Veeva, but not technically one instance because we have multiple servers, but I think the configuration set and everything, we've standardized and rolled it out across the board.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And based on press releases that that you guys are interested or will be moving to the next version of their CRM as well. I was curious how do you think about that decision and whether to do that or to move to another option or just kind of wait and see?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Correct. I think right now, we will have partnered with them for the next five years. The software solution continues through '26 and above. And later, if we see Veeva in its current state is meeting our needs, I think the question that we're trying to understand is what is the cost of transition of it.

And what are the alternatives that are out there, like from where we are today, we don't see too many alternatives that reach the gamut of everything that we're doing with Veeva, hence a decision to continue with Veeva, at least for the next five years and then see what the industry evolves into.

**Tegus Client**
And explain to me, is it just that there's quite a few things you guys are doing with Veeva? And so it's hard to find to find someone that's got comprehensive?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. I think there's one, the amount of depth of features that Veeva has implemented that pertained to the pharma industry and how we've been running processes and how our organization is set up. I think a lot of that reflects into the business process and a lot of the business process is literally reflected into the system, and it makes processes run faster.

And then also, there's a lot of integration work that's needed, which if you build on to different Veeva products, that happens by design, if you will. Whereas otherwise, a lot of that is heavy development costs and heavy maintenance cost for us on the IT layer long term. So when we buy into a stack all across, especially in commercial, I can speak to it in much more detail.

R&D, we are still very young in that kind of implementation. But in commercial, we've seen that some of these processes, we've played with five, seven years ago, multiple different solutions that work in parallel bit. I think we've migrated to having Veeva as the one common solution end to end for the most business processes. I wouldn't say everything is there, but most of them we leverage Veeva.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And I guess, it sounded like to me from reading the press release that, I mean, I guess it says that Bayer will be among the first top 20 biopharmas to move to Veeva Vault CRM. And what I was curious about is why kind of do that move if I'm reading the press release correctly like versus waiting and seeing and let someone else do that. I was curious sort of why or how at least you think about that?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes, we like to see some kind of like feature development and product development that we are able to influence. And I think this is one pathway that we have to help shape the product and shape that we see fit. And also, I think there's also areas where we are transforming our organization a bit.

And I think timing some of these things, right, where we might be changing certain business processes, we might rather connect it with solution upgrades. The end rep facing solution would remain the same, that Veeva's current statement, but that might evolve. I think the bigger influence will be on how the platform is set up and managed and how headquarters users or back-office users are going to be using a lot of the suite iconic change.

**Tegus Client**
This is more kind of IT, basically what the reps see should stay the same, but the IT stuff on the back end might change a lot?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Correct. I think that yes, the change will be lower, smaller. I think you see even today, I think the reps iPad app, for example, is completely Veeva built and managed. It's not something that is Salesforce. But if the rep logs into something online on their computer or in their browser, then they see the Salesforce UI, for example. So that part of it will change, but the app component of it would remain similar or an evolution of more or less what they have today.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And just on the CRM side, first, I'm curious, what do you like about the Veeva CRM system, what strengths do you see with what weaknesses do you see with it? I'd love to just hear where you think it shines where you think it should be better?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. I think there are a few areas that Veeva has thought through the business process pretty well. The integration from how marketing interacts with sales reps and what the sales reps need to be speaking to customers about and they've also standardized a lot of a lot of the processes within the system where if a rep has captured certain feedback, they can route it directly through to the right workflows within what a marketeer should be doing or what the legal team might have to see.

It's also connected with ordering processes, for example, if you are dropping samples and so on. So a lot of the business process and how it connects into different parts of the value chain and connecting it into the process flow for that specific department or for that specific user has been pretty well laid out.

And they listen to customers pretty well. They have a customer ad board, and we provide feedback on what are the features that we see are required. Not everything gets prioritized, obviously, but at least we see what they are prioritizing and also, I think if most pharma companies raise their voice, things eventually get developed because it's a custom pharma specific solution.

So it essentially gets into what different pharma companies might need. And it also encompasses the regulatory frameworks that are needed and the required reporting requirements that are there that can be captured, all of that. And it flows into different areas. The CRM connects with, say, the event platform that we have, where you might need to run events with physicians, it is connected to transfer of value reporting that you might need with our regulatory department.

**Tegus Client**
What's transfer of value reporting?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Transfer of value reporting is basically when you need to report what benefits you're providing to physicians any given year in the U.S., it's called Sunshine Act, in France, there's a different name, but essentially, all of it is about reporting transfer of value from the pharma company to doctors, and it enables some of that capturing some of that as well within the system and so on. So yes, there is a multitude of these processes, which connect seamlessly into the business flow, which is a big add-on.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then are there multiples here? It sounds like you got Veeva as kind of a universal CRM system across the organization, not kind of that there's multiple of them floating around.

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. Right now, it is the universal organization, at least in pharma, in consumer and so on, we use different stuff, but within pharma it is.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then what about kind of areas for improvement, like what kind of about the system would you like or wherever you like it to be better?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
I think Veeva has traditionally been focused on being the CRM, and that means they are focused heavily on the sales reps because that has been the major part of how pharma companies have engaged with customers previously. The amount of digital engagement or headquarters-driven marketing activities or how we integrate and look at patient engagement activities where patients are also customers, especially in markets like U.S. and so on.

That kind of features seems to be much lower and I think that is where Veeva could improve a lot. Those are essentially areas where we invest a lot outside of Veeva and on other digital engagement or digital marketing platforms. I think those features would make a big difference on making those connections more seamless and being a more holistic CRM solution.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And so, what other digital marketing platforms are valuable for you to fill that need?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
So for example, we use the native Salesforce platform for a lot of our other digital marketing activities. We use Salesforce also for a lot of our data management components as well. Veeva has their data platform that they have started to launch, but I think it's still pretty nascent. I think the data management component and the analytics components could improve in Veeva a lot more.

Those are areas where we use other solutions like we either custom build solutions on native data software solutions like Snowflake, for example, or we buy or license certain solutions from industry-specific companies like ZS Associates or Axtria or some of these guys where they have built certain industry tools on managing the data.

So that's on the data side. On the engagement side, Salesforce is the core. We also use Seevent for event engagement, for example, that's to run event. We use the Adobe suite sometimes for web engagement and platforms like running all of our digital advertising. We use LiveRamp and stuff like that as our audience management platform. So those are the kind of things that we use that are beyond just CRM that we connected to Veeva.

**Tegus Client**
And is there a need for you guys to use the kind of stuff that's, let's say the Salesforce Service Cloud, like if people are calling your call centers?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
Interesting to hear about how do you guys use the Service Cloud?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
For exactly that reason, like we use Service Cloud for our contact centers where doctors call in to us, we use Service Cloud also as our customer service platform for when people have issues with product or like they want to report certain events or even for adverse event reporting, we use Service Cloud as the back-end solution that manages a lot of that. So there's a few different customer engagement areas that we use ServiceMax as a back-end solution.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And one of the things that Veeva has talked about that I'd be interested to get your reaction to is an intention to get more into the marketing and service areas. I believe their prior agreement with Salesforce limited how much they could do, for example, in the service cloud space and the digital marketing space because Salesforce has products in those areas? And I guess, Veeva now wanting to do more there. I'm curious if you were working at Veeva, is that an opportunity you like, or think is compelling for them or not?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. I can't give you details on what we are working with them. But I think in general, if I think about the Veeva, if I put myself on Veeva's shoes, I think it is definitely an area that they should be focusing on. Those are big spend areas for pharma in general. And I think the Salesforce platform natively offers a lot of that integration.

And right now, because Veeva and Salesforce run on the same platform, a lot of that integration happens due to Salesforce's capabilities. And in the future, if there'd be couple Veeva from the Salesforce platform, that would become a bigger burden for companies like us, for example.

I think marketing is the other area which is growing in terms of percentage spend that pharma has on overall promotional activities. And I think that's the other space which is very native to Salesforce, and they've made huge progress there.

And I think if Veeva really want to make themselves as the one place where pharma wants to operate all of their customer engagement, then I think it really makes sense for them to invest in that area as well.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And a little speculative, but I wonder what could Veeva do in your mind do better in the service area? Like in the CRM area, they do better at handling meeting your guys' needs than kind of a generic non-pharma-oriented CRM system. I'd be curious within both marketing and service if there are things that you think a pharma-specific system could do better than a more generic one?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
I think right now they do not have offerings that are compelling enough in either of those two spaces. I think having a compelling enough solution to offer would be a start. I think having an alternative to Salesforce that people are ready to adopt.

Even if it's not industry-specific, if it gives the integration advantages that we might lose, I think that's a good enough starting point. I don't know if everyone would bind to that in jump shift, but I think that would be a fair starting point for them to have.

There is a lot more customization that they could do. The amount of development work that we do on top of Salesforce to enable a lot of the service center to actually integrate back with our medical requirements, like content management requirements, with our adverse event reporting, for example, there's a lot of custom build that we do on top of the native Salesforce platform to make the current solution work.

I could foresee if we were building similar business process layer on top of any regular service center type platform that they're able to then offer to people that reduces the internal maintenance efforts or internal customer built that people like us, like buyers do or like any big pharma, for example, would be doing. And that could be the reason why they capture up more customers or capture a bigger share of that pie.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And then what about kind of on the marketing side? Kind of it sounds like maybe Adobe is perhaps more important for you guys than Salesforce. But I'd be curious if there are opportunities you see there where Adobe is lacking or even where someone like Veeva could potentially do better. Again, long, long, long ways from getting there. But I'd be curious if you see any kind of glaring opportunities?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes, frankly, on the marketing side, I see the customer requirements are increasing a lot, and I think platforms like Adobe are also making quite a few advances. I see a bigger hurdle for Veeva to cross on the marketing side, to be honest, for them to get there.

The only few things that I could think of are clearly advantageous. I think if they really integrate their CRM solution with headquarters and make marketing or medical and CRM as really an omnichannel play, connecting all three of them into one common engagement mechanism and treating each of them as service points for customers, similar to what, say, ServiceMax does or like a Twilio does, for example, or something like that.

Rethinking the way you do the front end of marketing where business process are concerned, I think that could be an advantage. But from a true execution standpoint, I think that Adobe and even Salesforce actually have quite a few layers.

Especially, on the marketing side, I think the connection between marketing and data and programmatic, I think there's a lot of things to connect. You also need to be able to connect some of these to programmatic ad servers and connected to the right networks on display ads that you would like to have and so on.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, coming for the Veeva to be there.

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Exactly. I see either partnerships or acquisitions as the only way that they can really step into that game pretty heavily. Otherwise, I think it will be too big of a hurdle for them to invest in and actually grow.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. I want to talk about the data side. You've mentioned that you guys use, I believe, it was OpenData?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Correct.

**Tegus Client**
And maybe just talking about OpenData, what do you use Veeva OpenData for? And have you been using it for a long time? Are there other data providers that you get the same data from? I'd be curious how it fits into your broader data strategy and what you do with that?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. So OpenData, it is a reference data. It provides us with a lot of details on like all of our customer information, what are their e-mails, like what organizations are they connected with, all of that. It is delivered onto the Veeva Network.

That is how we manage our sales steps and customer mapping. It's a platform that helps us manage our overall territory design and map people to key accounts or map key accounts to key map like our key account managers and so on.

They have been playing in the field for, I think, around 10 years. We used to buy data from IQVIA, which is a big service provider across the world and from many other smaller companies in very specific countries.

I think Nordics have one specific country. U.K. has one specific data provider, et cetera. But on a global scale, IQVIA was the only alternative that we had, and we used to be buying this data from IQVIA for quite a long time.

And I think we've started making the transition in some countries. I think 2017, '18 onwards, Veeva has been getting pretty mature, and they've matched the customer data requirements that we've had and the coverage of customers that we've had pretty well across the board. That's the reason we switched over to Veeva OpenData now since the last couple of years, I must say.

And it's basically across the HCP, like it could be HCP information. It is HCO information, so organization information. It is affiliations between HCPs and HCOs. That's the information that we get from OpenData.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And how does the data you get from OpenData? Is it similar or different than what we used to get from IQVIA?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
It is pretty much similar. The amount of coverage of like e-mail information and the frequency of update of the information is something that was higher.

**Tegus Client**
Was higher with IQVIA or is higher with Veeva?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Veeva was higher, the frequency that they are updating in the data was higher. And then we have the data stewardship service that they offer, which is also faster. They have much faster turnaround times, essentially for the customer.

**Tegus Client**
What service?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Data stewardship service. When a sales rep in the country is on the field and he visits the office and he sees that the person has moved or their office has closed or something like that, they would raise the request, and that eventually gets updated by Veeva, someone verifies it, and it's updated in the system automatically or it's updated in the system after they agree to it, after the Steward say yes, but the turnaround time for that was much faster.

Previously, it used to be a couple of weeks to a week. Now it's a few days, if not a day. And I think that's important because these guys, on the field, want to record what conversations they've had and so on, and they would see that customer change, and that's not something that's ideal for them.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And so, is this something now where you just buy the data from Veeva? Or do you get it from both Veeva and IQVIA?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
We buy the data from Veeva. There are only very specific markets we'll get it from both because we still don't have enough coverage from Veeva on certain areas. But yes, I would say a large majority of it is only Veeva.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And you mentioned kind of some smaller providers still data providers like the Nordics. Is that something that you still need to get some data from those?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
There are some areas like oncology, for example, where Veeva still don't have high coverage in smaller countries, and that is where we still do have smaller providers providing us that information.

But Veeva seems to be increasing coverage on the road map and they're also actually from the last time that I said I think they are trying to pass on with some of these providers as well to bring them on to their own platform and so on. It's either of them building their own capabilities or partnering that they're trying to increase their coverage massively.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then from a pricing perspective, how is the cost of this data different from Veeva and IQVIA, if you know?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
I think the last time that we did a comparison review, they were slightly cheaper. I'd say below 20% cheaper, but still cheaper. And I think their advantage is to offer it as a package offering with CRM and provide better pricing models.

I think it's also a challenge for Veeva to operate and for pharma customers because of the lawsuit that they've had ongoing with IQVIA that it makes us challenging to use some of their platforms. I think there's a few reasons why they are cheap, and they want to keep their solution cheaper, but also offer better packages on leveraging different components of Veeva suite to make it adoptable.

**Tegus Client**
Overall, does it feel like you guys have lost anything by not having the IQVIA data moving to this Veeva data or kind of not really?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Not really right now. I think in the early stages there were places where there was a challenge in the customer base that we were able to reach, but we had to augment it. It felt in some cases where we are duplicating purchases, but I think that is decreasing massively.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And so I'm curious are there other data that you guys still sort of moving beyond, I guess, OpenData? Or is there other data that you guys still buy from IQVIA?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. There's data from Veeva Link that we have started purchase and I think that's giving us information on scientific awareness like publications that people have and so on. And then also Veeva Compass, I think, is something that we are starting to explore. We haven't purchased it yet. I don't think they have rolled it out fully, but I think that's also another area that we are exploring. But those are the few things that we're looking at.

**Tegus Client**
What is Veeva Compass? Or kind of what would that either supplement or replace?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
It is data for like HCP level or customer level data that should be available in the U.S. that helps us understand what kind of products the customers are using and so on. That's essentially their alternative that they're starting for IQVIA's prescriber data.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And is that something you're interested in or kind of not all that interested in?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes, something that we haven't gone down the route of purchasing and actively using, but that's something that we're exploring. But Link is something that we use. Link is key account data around how many customers. Like in a certain stakeholder network, what kind of customers do we have, like who are the key decision-makers, that kind of information.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And then on the Compass side, what would you want to see or kind of how do you think you'll evaluate kind of the Compass data versus the data you get from IQVIA?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. I think there's three or four key KPIs that we look at. The first one would be coverage. What coverage of the market do they have? Do they represent a similar size of the market? Do they represent a similar share of customers that we're looking at?

I think the second one would be granularity and the granularity of the data and the longitudinal view that we get. How long of a history do we have on the data? And what level of granularity? And does the coverage remain the same across the full history that we are interested in?

And then also the competitor information, like what kind of competitor information do we have available? Those are the kind of parameters that we'd be interested in. And I think the last one is also time to availability.

Do we have weekly data do we have monthly data? How long after the week has closed or the month has closed? Do we actually get our hands on the data? Those are the kind of things that would be important for us to evaluate if it is really an alternative or not.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And I guess, do you see opportunity for Veeva to improve versus the IQVIA prescriber data in those dimensions?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. In the U.S., I think there's quite a few data providers that play in this space. All of them offering different parts of the solution. And I think Veeva could definitely play a part in optimizing some of this.

Right now, they're focusing this in the U.S. only. I think if they move outside of the U.S., I think there's even a bigger dearth of data providers and IQVIA, in most cases, is the only provider that's out there. And I think Veeva could actually have a bigger role to play outside of the U.S. if they actually build out their data network there.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And generally speaking, when looking at IQVIA versus Veeva, within the data product space, are you more optimistic about kind of IQVIA's prospects at being kind of the data provider of choice for the industry or Veeva or perhaps someone else?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
I think right now, IQVIA is the standard data provider across the industry. Hence, they have, I think, quite a big. It's almost a monopoly and they have quite a big influence on their pricing strategies, on how they define the industry definition and so on. I think having credible alternatives.

Like we are seeing in the U.S. right now. I think the U.S. market is a lot more competitive, and I think IQVIA actually does a much better job in U.S. right now, because of some of the competitors that are pushing the boundaries on how well is the claims data can configure? How well is patient information available? How long of a history do we actually get to? What level of granularity do they maintain ICD codes, and so on?

There's a lot of stuff that I think IQVIA has improved once like credible competitors like Symphony. There's quite a few that have come into the place. And I think Veeva could do the same for the kind of data that is available.

IQVIA, in general, has quite a big network of affiliations and data providers that they have contracts with. Reaching that scale will be a big challenge or a big step to cross. But I think being a pharma specific company and having the right scale of connections or touch points in the organization, Veeva could be a challenger. I think Veeva is one of the better players to be a challenger, I would say.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And when looking at Veeva's data strategy and approach, where do you think kind of they're getting things right? If they've had missteps where they had missteps and kind of how either optimistic or pessimistic are you about them kind of on the data provision side?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
I think they're still evolving their data strategy. I don't think they have perfected their data strategy yet. They were launching their data cloud, if I remember correctly, a few years ago. I don't think they are investing in that product too much just yet.

I think they have pivoted more to consulting or like commercial analytics providers. Service provider kind of offering there rather than a product offering which they have in most other places. But I think they're starting to solve some core problems.

I think they've identified, I would say, accurately that availability of data in pharma is a big challenge. So tackling that problem of collecting the data and making it available across the pharma dusty, I think is a big place to start and hence a lot of their data products that they're building out.

And I think the pharma companies, they value timeliness of information a lot more. So they're focused on making their offerings to be faster and accurate, but also faster for the reps. I think that's something that they've learned from their CRM experience working with sales reps and they're improving that.

There are places where they are learning from the access that they have to the customers like their end users, which is the sales reps or the marketing teams and building that into their data strategy. Those are things that they're getting right.

But I think their product strategy is something that they still need to evolve. I think similar to the marketing platform and the service center platform, for example, that we spoke about, even on the data side, all of the pharma companies spend quite a lot of resources on actually building and maintaining their data stack.

And I think at least on the commercial side, the data stack is pretty similar. I think those are areas where they could productize it and have it as a solution. There are consulting companies or service provider companies that are aiming to do that.

That associate actually is one that I know of that actually are building out data management platforms as products that are pharma specific. I think those are areas that they can still improve and play a role.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then I was curious next on the R&D side. What have you kind of seen, I know you spend more of your time on the commercial and medical side. But on the R&D side, where have you kind of seen Veeva do well? Where have you seen them kind of lacking? I was curious kind of just for your high-level take on what you've seen from them there?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. I think the areas that they're starting to roll out, there's a lot of the content management part within R&D that they are doing pretty well. Bringing their promos, moving it into their quality dock component or like the QMS space, for example, on all of the processes that we are trying to integrate.

The knowledge that they have in GXP relevant software. They're using that pretty well to build a lot of these requirements that are process requirements that we have. Things on how we actually run our clinical operations. I think they have decent offerings, but I think those are areas that they can still improve a lot more.

How do we actually manage that site information and how do we improve payment processes there, et cetera. I think those are places where they are starting to. I think it's part of their product strategy, but they haven't yet closed the gap to say what customers had built using standard payment software or standard process management tools, et cetera.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And when thinking at a larger customer like for you guys, like if you and your team want some more products from Veeva, how does that work? Like I'm wondering kind of from a procurement or buying side, when there's such a big relationship with a company like Veeva, how does the company think about their relationship with Veeva? And how does their work decide how many products they want? And I was just curious for context and kind of how the relationship works?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. I think we usually have people either in the countries who are wanting to try out new solutions and they reach out to the account managers or engagement managers that we have from Veeva.

Procurement gets involved usually, and the global product owners or process owners like folks on my team and similarly across the board are involved in those purchasing decisions. I think we have different ways of approaching that problem, either we see solutions that are standard add-ons to their native product offering that we are able to purchase and roll out across the board for all of the users that we have within the organization at once.

Or there might be some solutions where a larger effort is needed to actually implement it in our environment or configure it and actually connect it back to our data management solutions and so on. Maybe there are country-specific requirements to begin with and then we might want to evaluate if that's actually the best option.

So those places we may be piloted with a few countries or few user groups, test it out and then eventually scale it. It could be add-ons that we look at. Specifically, it could be enterprise level decisions right from the get-go. And then we have regular reviews on utilization progress and so on that we steer our engagement.

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. And really for other big pharma organizations like yours, you're spending tens of millions of dollars in Veeva, on many different Veeva solutions, what influences whether that kind of spend number moves? Would Veeva move up or down each year moves?

Is it at the point where it shouldn't move very meaningfully anymore? Or is there kind of enough opportunity still on the Veeva side to solve problems for you and to increase that amount. I'd be curious to hear how the company thinks about its spend level with Veeva and whether there's opportunity still for Veeva to grow it meaningfully?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. I think there are a few that are more based on how the company is evolving, which I think happened, so if the company is growing, if the number of sales reps is growing, for example, and so on, I think the licensing prices will increase accordingly.

And similarly, if the companies are shrinking, I think they will evolve accordingly. There are different tiers of slabs that we negotiate with Veeva on pricing models and so on. I think on the offerings, I'd say there are a few mature products and there are a few early-stage products that Veeva has at hand.

On the major products, I would say it's pretty stable, and I would assume that it remains stable. There is a continuous improvement of the feature set that we would expect and that Veeva promises on a regular basis.

On the newer products, I think is where, depending on the problems that they are trying to address the spend could increase. I think those are areas where we might evaluate and say, is this the right product? And is this the right time for us to actually buy on to this solution or implement it across the organization and so on? And I think those are areas where they can still grow the relationship.

**Tegus Client**
And what kind of opportunities do you see for them? If you're saying the Veeva account managers choose to really to grow the relationship if they can get their products?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. I think R&D and clinical, these are areas where they are still pretty young, I would say. And then data, I think, is the other one where they're still pretty young in their journey. Those are the areas that I think they can still focus on.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then from a customer support perspective, how well or how poorly do you think Veeva has done kind of for you and your teams?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Overall, I think the customer support is pretty good. They have different models of supporting us. I think their most preferred way is to work with partners who actually implement the support instead of Veeva as an organization, taking it up themselves.

They have their partner ecosystem that they certify and maintain and so on. But there's also Veeva product engineers that are on hand for implementations that help us on the support. They act as our final line of defense, if you will.

And I think the Veeva product teams in general are pretty good. The service ecosystem that they have, I think is something that depends on who you choose and how premium provider are they and so on, that influences the support it.

But from Veeva as an organization itself, I think we are pretty content with how there is also some of the issues. There are areas where certain problems or issues that we identify are product limitations, I would say.

Those are areas where it is much harder because I think influencing the product road map becomes much harder at this scale that Veeva is right now. And those are areas where I think we've always had discussions and negotiations on how to get it done.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then kind of on an overall basis, on a scale from one to 10, how likely would you be to recommend Veeva to peers of yours or I guess, Veeva products to peers of yours?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
If you ask me as a blanket statement, I would say a seven. On some of them it would be a nine and some of them it would be a five. So I'd say it's a seven overall.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And for which one would it be a nine and for which one would it be a five?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
I think for the established ones like CRM PromoMats, I would say it's nine. For most of the others, I would say it's six or five. I think the data I would also say is an eight. I think they're getting much better, OpenData specifically. Link and so on are still maturing. If you have other solutions, yes, those ones, I'd say, are five.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And for the others you're thinking about these are kind of some of the younger data areas? Or what do you think of them?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Link and Compass, those are more of the younger areas that, I would say, six and five I would say, respectively. And then for the clinical components and for the research components, I would say they are seven.

I think clinical management they are pretty well, but clinical trial management, I'd say this, it's six. It's still something that needs to improve. But I'm not too much into the details there. So I can't say specifics of what they should improve, but I think these are more aggregate insights that I see from our own company.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then on the PromoMats side, we haven't talked about that much. I was curious what the value proposition for that product is for you guys, and it'd be great just to hear a little bit more on how you think about that?

**VP, Global Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics Markets & Customer Powerhouse for Bayer AG**
Yes. And on PromoMats, it's a content management system for all of our marketing content that goes out to the sales teams. There are regulations on how we can promote things to physicians, how they are connected with specific publications and so on and requirements on legal claims that we need to maintain, et cetera.

A lot of that is something that is managed within the system as a process flow. You as a marketer could actually create a piece of content, we send it to someone in legal to review it, get it validated and so on. And eventually publish it and push it down to all of the sales reps who work with you on the product.

That's the value prop of the product itself. It's something that we leverage across the board. I think it's one of our core components of how we manage our content ecosystem for marketing content, but also for medical content. It also has native integrations into CRM.

If someone in headquarters has actually created a new set of content elements that should now go out into the field and sales reps should be using it, using PromoMats, for example, gives us much faster way time to market.

From when we say, yes, the content is ready and everything is fixed, from that time to when it is actually out in the field and sales reps are using it, it's much faster because of PromoMats compared to other content management solutions that are out there.

**Tegus Client**
