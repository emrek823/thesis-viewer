AUTH, AUDIT AND PAY: INITIAL APPS THAT SECURE CRITICAL DATASETS

**Flow Diagram Components:**
*   **Inputs to AI-ASSISTED POLICY CAPTURE:**
    *   MEDICAL POLICY
    *   CODING RULES
    *   PAYMENT POLICY
    *   CONTRACTS
*   **AI-ASSISTED POLICY CAPTURE** feeds into **POLICY SOURCE OF TRUTH**
*   **POLICY SOURCE OF TRUTH** feeds into:
    *   **MACHINIFY AUTH** (via PORTAL AI CHAT) -> AUTH DB
    *   **MACHINIFY SHADOW ADJUDICATION**
*   **MACHINIFY AUTH** -> ADJUDICATION -> CLAIM
*   **MACHINIFY SHADOW ADJUDICATION** receives input from POLICY SOURCE OF TRUTH and feeds into:
    *   **AUDIT DECISION** (PRE-PAY)
    *   **CLINICAL / CODING / BILLING REVIEW** (NO AUDIT)
    *   **PAYMENT POLICY ENFORCEMENT**
*   **AUDIT DECISION** -> ADJUDICATION -> CLAIM
*   **CLINICAL / CODING / BILLING REVIEW** (NO AUDIT) -> POST-PAY LOOPBACK
*   **DATA STORE** includes: AUTH DB, RECORDS DB, CLAIM DB

**TWO KEY AI USE CASES**

1.  **Policy capture**
    a. Leverage LLMs to translate policy into code
    b. Human-verified for compliance
    c. Deterministic enforcement sometimes feasible downstream

2.  **Policy enforcement**
    a. **Analytical:** Predict anomalies/errors in diagnosis/procedure coding/treatment via LLMs trained on medical history
    b. **Extractive:** Read complex documents to extract administrative or clinical details relevant to policy.
    c. **Deductive:** Collate evidentiary elements to deduce higher-order clinical/coding/billing criteria and make decisions.
    d. **Deterministic:** Execute pre-captured policy rules at scale
