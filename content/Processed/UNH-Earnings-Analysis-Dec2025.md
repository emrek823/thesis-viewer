## Executive Summary

UnitedHealth Group experienced a dramatic deterioration over the past 15 months, transitioning from confident navigation of external headwinds to a full-blown operational crisis requiring leadership overhaul and massive earnings reset. The company slashed 2025 EPS guidance from ~$30 to "at least $16" — a 47% reduction — citing systematic underestimation of medical cost trends across all business lines. This report traces the evolution of the crisis through three earnings calls and assesses the multi-year recovery path.

**Key Metrics Progression:**

| Metric | Q3 2024 | Q4 2024 | Q2 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| EPS Guidance | $27.50-27.75 | ~$30 (2025) | ≥$16 (2025) |
| Medical Care Ratio | ~85% | 86.5% target | 89.25% |
| MA Cost Trend Assumption | ~5% | "respectful" | 7.5% actual |
| Leadership | Witty/Thompson | Witty/Thompson | Hensley/Noel/Conway |

## Section 1: The Unraveling — Timeline of Deterioration

### Phase 1: Manageable Headwinds (Q3 2024)

In October 2024, management characterized challenges as "transitory" and navigable:

**Three identified pressures:**
1. **Hospital coding intensity** — Certain systems upshifted coding by 20%+, converting outpatient to inpatient stays
2. **Medicaid rate/acuity mismatch** — State rates lagging 12-18 months behind actual member acuity post-redetermination
3. **Specialty drug acceleration** — IRA eliminated catastrophic phase coinsurance, pulling forward utilization

Management projected 2025 EPS "upper end around $30" — acknowledging conservatism but maintaining 13-16% long-term growth commitment. CEO Andrew Witty emphasized value-based care as the strategic differentiator and highlighted AI-driven cost reduction initiatives.

**Critical miss:** Management believed specialty drug acceleration was a timing shift (pulled from 2025 into 2024), not a structural increase. This assumption proved catastrophically wrong.

### Phase 2: Confident But Cautious (Q4 2024 — January 2025)

The Q4 2024 call opened with acknowledgment of Brian Thompson's murder — a harbinger of broader challenges ahead. Despite delivering $27.66 EPS (within original range), the call revealed deeper issues:

**Medical care ratio 150bp above original outlook**, driven by:
- Member mix: "Different profile of consumer than expected" — didn't grow as planned due to competitor benefit designs
- Medicaid timing mismatch persisting longer than anticipated
- Cyberattack business disruption (~$0.75/share impact)
- Aggressive hospital coding and specialty prescribing acceleration

**2025 pricing confidence statement:** "The answer is yes. And here's why... outlook incorporates a view of care activity commensurate with what we saw in '24."

This statement aged poorly. Management's "respectful view of care activity" proved insufficiently conservative.

### Phase 3: Crisis and Reset (Q2 2025 — July 2025)

The July 2025 call revealed a company in crisis:

**New Leadership Team:**
- Stephen Hensley (CEO) — replacing Andrew Witty
- Tim Noel (UHC CEO)
- Patrick Conway (Optum CEO)
- Roger Connor (CFO, Optum)
- Krista Nelson (COO, Optum Health)

**Tone shift:** Management used words like "humility," "transparency," "reform," "remediation" — a stark departure from prior confidence.

**Quantified Damage:**

| Business | Shortfall vs. Plan | Key Drivers |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| UnitedHealthcare | $6.5B | Pricing assumptions 250bp short of actual trend |
| Optum Health | $6.6B | V28 underestimation, new patient mix, trend acceleration |
| Medicare Advantage | $3.6B | 7.5% actual trend vs 5% priced |
| Commercial | $2.3B | ACA morbidity mismatch, group trend 100bp high |
| Medicaid | Remainder | Behavioral trend at 20% |

## Section 2: Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Medicare Advantage Pricing Failure

Management admitted fundamental pricing errors:

> "When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings, back in the first half of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently."

**Specific failures:**
- Priced for 5% trend; experienced 7.5% — a 250bp miss
- Medicare Supplement trend hit 11% (vs 8-9% historical) — confirmation of broad-based cost acceleration
- 70% of MA pressure from physician/outpatient; inpatient accelerating through Q2
- "Most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more"

**Structural vs. cyclical:** Management initially characterized pressures as "transitory." The Q2 2025 call implicitly acknowledges these are structural, requiring multi-year remediation.

### 2.2 V28 Risk Model Transition — $11B Headwind

The CMS V28 risk adjustment model change proved far more damaging than anticipated:

**Optum Health V28 Impact:**
- Original estimate: $9B over 3 years
- Revised estimate: $11B over 3 years
- Through 2025: $7B realized (vs $5B original estimate)
- "Overestimated the impact and misexecuted the planned efforts to offset"

**Value-based care margins compressed:**
- 2023: ~5% operating margin
- 2024: ~3% operating margin
- 2025: ~1% operating margin (guidance)
- Long-term target: Reduced to 5% (from higher)

### 2.3 New Patient Cohort Drag

OptumHealth's rapid growth created margin pressure:

**Cohort margin profile:**
| Vintage | % of Patients | Margin |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| 2024-2025 | 40% | Negative (near -10%) |
| 2022-2023 | ~35% | ~2% |
| 2021 and prior | ~25% | 8%+ |

> "Nearly forty percent of patients served today having come in since the beginning of 2024... These new patients are largely in markets where numerous plan exits occurred, they include complex patients who require time to be managed effectively."

The growth-at-all-costs strategy created an embedded drag that will take years to remediate.

### 2.4 Discontinued Portfolio Actions

Management halted ~$2B in planned portfolio actions (divestitures, contract restructuring):

> "I came in and looked at that, my orientation is to pursue more of the performance of the business portfolio that we have... We stopped that entire activity."

This reversal suggests prior management was attempting to mask underlying performance issues through asset sales and one-time gains.

## Section 3: Remediation Strategy Assessment

### 3.1 Pricing Response

**Medicare Advantage 2026:**
- Pricing for ~10% trend (vs 7.5% current)
- "Significant adjustments to benefits"
- Plan exits affecting 600,000+ members (primarily PPO)
- Target margin: 2.5-3% (vs 2-4% range)

**Commercial:**
- Pricing for 11%+ trend
- Membership declines expected
- Shift toward self-funded/level-funded products

**Medicaid:**
- Continued state engagement for rate adequacy
- Expecting 2026 losses in non-dual segment

### 3.2 Operational Restructuring

**Optum Health:**
- Four regional market leaders (consolidated from more dispersed model)
- Exiting ~200,000 patients from fully accountable PPO arrangements
- Shifting risk back to payers in markets without "hardened capacity"
- $1B cost reduction target for 2026

**Optum Insight:**
- New leadership (Divya Surat Devara)
- AI-powered product portfolio pivot
- Recovery from cyberattack "pacing more slowly than expected"

### 3.3 Capital Allocation Restraint

Management signaled conservatism:
- "Strike a balance as to how we use capital over the near term"
- Share repurchase paused (only completed earlier in year)
- Amedisys acquisition still pending regulatory approval
- Dividend maintained (increased 5% in June)

---

## Section 4: Multi-Year Earnings Bridge

**Management's recovery timeline:**

| Year | EPS Expectation | Key Drivers |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| 2025 | ≥$16 | Absorbing trend miss, V28 year 3, portfolio actions reversed |
| 2026 | "Solid but moderate growth" | 80% of premium reprices Jan 1, benefit restructuring |
| 2027 | "Strengthening quickly" | V28 fully absorbed, cohort maturation, pricing catch-up |
| 2028+ | Return to 13-16% CAGR | Normalized operations |

**Critical assumption:** Management believes underlying trend will stabilize and 2025 was the trough. If medical cost acceleration persists into 2026, the recovery timeline extends significantly.

## Section 5: Investment Thesis

### Bear Case (Base Case)

1. **Trust deficit:** Three consecutive quarters of downward revisions destroyed management credibility. New leadership is unproven at this scale.

2. **Structural cost problem:** The characterization of pressures as "transitory" proved wrong. Provider coding intensity, specialty drug utilization, and care seeking behavior may represent permanent step-changes.

3. **Value-based care model stress-tested:** The V28 transition revealed OptumHealth's vulnerability to risk adjustment changes. With 40% of patients in money-losing cohorts, the growth strategy created embedded losses.

4. **Competitive positioning weakened:** 600,000+ member exits in MA create openings for Humana, CVS, and regional plans. Commercial pricing increases will accelerate membership losses.

5. **Political/regulatory risk:** Management acknowledged "continuing public controversy over longstanding entire health care sector. Particularly managed care." The Thompson murder elevated scrutiny of prior authorization and claims practices.

### Bull Case

1. **Scale advantages persist:** UNH remains the largest diversified healthcare company with unmatched data assets and negotiating leverage.

2. **Pricing reset creates margin recovery runway:** 2026 pricing reflecting 10% trend provides cushion if actual trend moderates.

3. **New leadership reset:** Hensley's "reform and change mandate" could surface additional issues but also positions for clean restart.

4. **Value-based care thesis intact:** Despite near-term margin compression, the structural advantages of coordinated care remain. Mature cohorts still generating 8%+ margins.

---

## Section 6: Key Monitoring Metrics

**Quarterly tracking:**
1. Medical care ratio progression vs. 89.25% guidance
2. OptumHealth value-based care margins (target: ~1% for 2025)
3. MA membership retention through 2026 AEP
4. State Medicaid rate updates timeline
5. V28 offset execution (50% mitigation target for 2026)

**Red flags:**
- MCR exceeding 90% in any quarter
- Further leadership changes
- Additional plan market exits
- Dividend reduction

---

## Conclusion

UnitedHealth Group's 2025 crisis represents the most significant operational failure in the company's modern history. The combination of pricing errors, V28 underestimation, growth-driven cohort drag, and leadership turnover creates a multi-year recovery scenario. While the company's scale and diversification provide downside protection, the path to normalized earnings (2027+) requires flawless execution by unproven leadership in an industry facing structural cost pressures and elevated political scrutiny.

We rate UNH UNDERWEIGHT with a $380 price target, reflecting 15x our 2026 EPS estimate of $25, a discount to historical multiples given execution risk and reduced visibility.
