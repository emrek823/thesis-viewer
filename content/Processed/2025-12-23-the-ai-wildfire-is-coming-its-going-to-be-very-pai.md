# The AI Wildfire Is Coming. It's Going to Be Very Painful and Incredibly Healthy.

### AI won’t crash—it will burn. Like every tech cycle, the fire will clear the brush, redistribute talent, and leave infrastructure to power what comes next. The question is: what kind of plant are you?

## The Fire Season

At a recent CEO dinner in Menlo Park, someone asked the familiar question: Are we in an AI bubble?

One of the dinner guests, a veteran of multiple Silicon Valley cycles, reframed the conversation entirely. She argued for thinking of this moment as a wildfire rather than a bubble. The metaphor landed immediately. Wildfires don’t just destroy; they’re essential to ecosystem health. They clear the dense underbrush that chokes out new growth, return nutrients to the soil, and create the conditions for the next generation of forest to thrive.

As I reflected on the wildfire metaphor, a framework emerged that revealed something deeper, built on her reframing. It offered a taxonomy for understanding who survives, who burns, and why, with specific metrics that separate the fire-resistant from the flammable.

The first web cycle burned through dot-com exuberance and left behind Google, Amazon, eBay, and PayPal: the hardy survivors of Web 1.0. The next cycle, driven by social and mobile, burned again in 2008–2009, clearing the underbrush for Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, and the offspring of Y Combinator. Both fires followed the same pattern: excessive growth, sudden correction, then renaissance.

Now, with AI, we are once again surrounded by dry brush.

**The coming correction will manifest as a wildfire rather than a bubble burst. Understanding that distinction changes everything about how to survive and thrive in what comes next.**

## The Overgrown Forest

When the brush grows too dense, sunlight can’t reach the ground. The plants compete against each other for light, water, and nutrients rather than against the environment.

That’s what Silicon Valley feels like right now.

Capital is abundant, perhaps too abundant. But talent? That’s the scarce resource. Every promising engineer, designer, or operator is being courted by three, five, ten different AI startups, often chasing the same vertical, whether it’s coding copilots, novel datasets, customer service, legal tech, or marketing automation.

The result is an ecosystem that looks lush from above: green, growing, noisy. But underneath, the soil is dry. Growth becomes difficult when everyone’s roots are tangled.

In that kind of forest, fire serves as correction rather than catastrophe.

## The Ecology of Fire

Wildfires don’t just destroy ecosystems. They reshape them. Some species ignite instantly. Others resist the flames. A few depend on the fire to reproduce.

The same is true for startups.

### The Flammable Brush

These are the dry grasses and resinous pines of the ecosystem: startups that look vibrant in a season of easy money but have no resistance once the air gets hot.

They include:

* AI application wrappers with no proprietary data or distribution
* Infrastructure clones in crowded categories (one more LLM gateway, one more vector database)
* Consumer apps chasing daily active users instead of durable users

They’re fueled by hype and ebullient valuations. When the heat rises, when capital tightens or customers scrutinize ROI, they go up in seconds.

**The flammable brush serves a purpose.** It attracts capital and talent into the sector. It creates market urgency. And when it burns, it releases those resources back into the soil for hardier species to absorb. The engineers from failed AI wrappers become the senior hires at the companies that survive.

### The Fire-Retardant Giants

Then there are the succulents, oaks, and redwoods: the incumbents that store moisture and protect their cores.

**Thick bark:** Strong balance sheets and enduring customer relationships.

**Deep roots:** Structural product-market fit in cloud, chips, or data infrastructure.

**Moisture reserves:** Real revenue, diversified businesses, and long-term moats.

Think Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon. They will absorb the heat and emerge stronger. When the smoke clears, these giants will stand taller, their bark charred but intact, while the smaller trees around them have burned to ash.

### The Resprouters

Some plants die back but grow again; manzanita, scrub oak, and toyon are phoenix-like. In startup terms, these are the pivots and re-foundings that follow a burn.

They’re teams with:

* Deep expertise
* Underground IP and data assets that survive even if the product doesn’t
* A willingness to prune and start over

After the fire, they re-sprout — leaner, smarter, and better adapted to the new terrain.

**This is where the real learning happens.** A founder who built the wrong product with the right team in 2024 becomes the founder who builds the right product with a battle-tested team in 2027. The failure gets stored underground, like nutrients in roots, waiting for the next season, rather than being wasted.

### The Fire Followers

Finally come the wildflowers. Their seeds are triggered by heat. They can’t even germinate until the old growth is gone.

These are the founders who start after the crash. They’ll hire from the ashes, build on cheaper infrastructure, and learn from the mistakes of those who burned. LinkedIn in 2002, Stripe in 2010, Slack in 2013. All are fire followers.

The next great AI-native companies will likely emerge here. These are the ones that truly integrate intelligence into workflows rather than just decorating them. And critically, the inference layer (where AI models actually run in production) represents the next major battleground. As compute becomes commoditized and agentic tools proliferate, the race will shift from training the biggest models to delivering intelligence most efficiently at scale.

## The Fire’s Function

Every few decades, Silicon Valley becomes overgrown. Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 both proved the same truth: too much growth chokes itself.

The Web 1.0 crash cleared away more than startups. It cleared noise. The Web 2.0 downturn, driven more by the mortgage crisis than the market itself, followed the same dynamic: overfunded competitors fell away, talent dispersed, and the survivors hired better, moved faster, and built stronger. Savvy companies even used the moment to get leaner, cutting underperformers and upgrading positions from entry-level to executive with hungry refugees from failed competitors.

That redistribution of talent may be the single most powerful outcome of any crash. Many of Google’s best early employees (the architects of what became one of the most durable business models in history) were founders or early employees of failed Web 1.0 startups.

And it went beyond talent alone. Entrepreneurial, restless, culturally impatient talent specifically shaped Google’s internal ethos. That DNA created Google’s experimental, aggressive, always-in-beta culture and radiated outward into the broader ecosystem for the next 10 to 20 years. The fire reallocated intelligence and rewired culture rather than simply destroying.

## Two Great Fires: 2000 and 2008

### The Burn of 2000

The 2000 wildfire was a full incineration. Infrastructure overbuild, easy capital, and speculative exuberance burned away nearly all profitless growth stories. Yet what remained were root systems: data centers, fiber optics, and the surviving companies that learned to grow slow and deep.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Eb5N!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee78a2ed-edc3-4c49-9e30-2437e65d1d42_1508x996.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Eb5N!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee78a2ed-edc3-4c49-9e30-2437e65d1d42_1508x996.png)

Amazon looked dead, down 95%, but emerged as the spine of digital commerce. eBay stabilized early and became the first profitable platform marketplace. Microsoft and Oracle converted their software monopolies into durable enterprise cashflows. Cisco, scorched by overcapacity, rebuilt slowly as networking became the plumbing for doing business.

By adding Apple, Google, and Salesforce, the story becomes one of succession as well as survival. Apple didn’t merely survive the fire; it changed the climate for everything that followed. Google sprouted where others burned, fueled by the very engineers and founders whose startups perished in the blaze. Salesforce took advantage of scorched corporate budgets to sell cloud-based flexibility, defining the SaaS model.

### The Ashes That Built the Internet

During the late 1990s, telecom firms raised roughly $2 trillion in equity and another $600 billion in debt to fuel the “new economy.” Even the stocks that symbolized the mania followed a predictable arc. Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, and Oracle together were worth around $83 billion in 1995; by 2000, their combined market cap had swelled to nearly $2 trillion. Qualcomm rose 2,700% in a single year.

That money paid for over 80 million miles of fiber-optic cable, more than three-quarters of all the digital wiring that had ever been installed in the U.S. up to that point. Then came the collapse.

By 2005, nearly 85% of those cables sat unused, strands of dark fiber buried in the ground. This was overcapacity born of overconfidence. But the fiber stayed. The servers stayed. The people stayed. And that excess soon became the backbone of modern life. Within just four years of the crash, the cost of bandwidth had fallen by 90%, and the glut of cheap connectivity powered everything that came next: YouTube, Facebook, smartphones, streaming, the cloud.

**That’s the paradox of productive bubbles: they destroy value on paper but create infrastructure in reality.** When the flames pass, the pipes, the code, and the talent remain — ready for the next generation to use at a fraction of the cost.

### The Burn of 2008

The Great Recession sparked a different kind of wildfire. Where Web 1.0’s flames had consumed speculative infrastructure, Web 2.0’s burned through business models and illusions. Venture funding froze. Advertising budgets evaporated. Credit tightened. Yet the survivors didn’t just withstand the heat. They metabolized it.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfOQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e94f5e3-b026-43c3-a2e7-444f192c34aa_1498x832.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfOQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e94f5e3-b026-43c3-a2e7-444f192c34aa_1498x832.png)

Apple turned adversity into dominance, transforming the iPhone from curiosity into cultural infrastructure. Amazon, having survived the dot-com inferno, emerged as the quiet supplier of the internet’s oxygen: AWS. Netflix reinvented itself for the streaming era, its growth literally running over the fiber laid down by the previous bubble. Salesforce proved that cloud software could thrive when capital budgets died. Google discovered that measurable performance advertising could expand even in recession. And Facebook (a seedling then) would soon root itself in the ashes, nourished by cheap smartphones and surplus bandwidth.

The 2008 fire selected for companies that could integrate hardware, software, and services into self-sustaining ecosystems rather than simply clearing space. The result was evolution, not merely recovery.

## The Canopy Problem

This cycle, though, introduces a new kind of fuel — the canopy fire.

In the past, the flames mostly consumed the underbrush (small, overvalued startups). Today, the heat is concentrated in the tallest trees themselves: Nvidia, OpenAI, Microsoft, and a handful of hyperscalers spending staggering sums with each other.

Compute has become both the oxygen and the accelerant of this market. Every dollar of AI demand turns into a dollar for Nvidia, which in turn fuels more investment into model training, which requires still more GPUs. This creates a feedback loop of mutual monetization.

**This dynamic has created something closer to an industrial bubble than a speculative one.** The capital isn’t scattered across a thousand dot-coms; it’s concentrated in a few massive bilateral relationships, with complex cross-investments that blur the line between genuine deployment and recycled capital.

When the wildfire comes (when AI demand normalizes or capital costs rise) the risk shifts. Instead of dozens of failed startups, we face a temporary collapse in compute utilization. Nvidia’s stock may not burn to ash, but even a modest contraction in GPU orders could expose how dependent the entire ecosystem has become on a few large buyers.

**That’s the real canopy problem: when the tallest trees grow too close, their crowns interlock, and when one ignites, the fire spreads horizontally, not just from the ground up.**

In Web 1.0, Oracle (the de facto database for all dot-coms) saw a symbolic collapse from $46 to $7 in 2000 before recovering to $79 by the launch of ChatGPT and $277 today. In Web 2.0’s wildfire, Google (the supplier of performance advertising) dropped 64% from $17 to $6 but exploded to $99 with ChatGPT’s launch and has since hit $257. In this cycle, the analog could be Nvidia. Not because it lacks fundamentals, but because its customers are all drawing from the same pool of speculative heat, fueled by complex cross-investments that have elicited scrutiny about whether capital is being genuinely deployed or simply recycled.

## The Coming Compute Abundance

Here’s where the AI wildfire may prove even more productive than its predecessors: the infrastructure being overbuilt today goes beyond fiber optic cable lying dormant in the ground. We’re building compute capacity, the fundamental resource constraini
