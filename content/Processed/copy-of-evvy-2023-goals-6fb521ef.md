**2023: Company-wide objectives & key results that drive this narrative**

**Build a profitable testing & care business**

1.  **Acquire customers sustainably**
    *   10% MoM new test customer growth
    *   $30 CAC
2.  **Increase 1-year CLV for each customer**

## Slide 9: Achievements

**(Image of two people in a room, with a presentation slide showing "How?")**

It's amazing to think back on what we've done in the past 10 months since we set out to launch care in Feb

*   We re-built our test from scratch & CLIA validated it to perform better than PCR panels
*   We built our own proprietary reference database for metagenomes in the vaginal microbiome
*   Built a full telehealth platform with personalized education and value
*   Designed & ran the first ever clinical study on personalized vaginal healthcare

All while growing our test business by 300%, building our first internal classification algorithms, and submitting our first two publications.
