AMAE Health

### 14 Million
People in the US struggle with a serious mental illness (SMI)*

**Existing treatment options are:**

*   **Expensive**
    *   >$300B spent on SMI in the US alone yearly
    *   6.3x higher spend per patient than compared to non-SMI population, as >50% of patients have a comorbidity
*   **Ineffective**
    *   SMI is the 2nd leading cause of 30-day readmissions in hospitals for Medicaid patients
*   **Fragmented**
    *   1 in 5 people with a SMI will also develop a substance use disorder - only 7% with dual diagnoses receive treatment for both

### 47%
In 2018, half of all adults with SMI did not receive psychiatric treatment

\*Serious mental illness is defined as someone over the age of 18 who has a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that causes serious functional impairment that substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. This includes a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder (MDD).

## Slide 3: Mental health is treated separately from physical health

DocSend
3/23
AMAE Health

**...is the brain not part of the body?**

*   Current treatments & the dominant mental health care model **do not address SDoH challenges**
*   Mental health is almost always **carved out of risk-bearing contracts**
*   Splitting mental health from physical health leads to **uncoordinated and fragmented care plans**

**This makes it challenging to deliver Personalized Care**
Current models cannot effectively account for individual needs, particularly for patients with serious mental illness
Ultimately this prevents comprehensive data tracking and insights, integration and efficiency for patient care

**We know the best outcomes are only possible when mental and physical health are integrated**

| Condition          | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Diabetes**       | • ~2x higher prevalence of diabetes in SMI patients than the general population (9% across the general U.S. population)                                                                                  |
| **Life Expectancy** | • 2-3 times higher average mortality for SMI patients compared to the general population, reflecting a 10-20 year reduction in life expectancy                                                           |
| **Hypertension**   | • Hypertension is 33% more prevalent in bipolar patients<br>• 48% of MDD patients have hypertension compared to 30% of the general population, an increase of 60%                                            |
| **Cardiovascular Issues** | • 1.5-3x higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in SMI patients when compared with the general population |

## Slide 5: There is great need for a new SMI care model

DocSend
5/23
AMAE Health

**Health equity and behavioral health are top priorities for payors**

*   **Evernorth (Cigna Corporation's health services business) shows when people with a BH condition receive treatment, costs decrease:**
    *   First-of-its-kind analysis proves medical and pharmacy costs can decrease by more than $3,000 per person over two years when people receive outpatient behavioral health care
*   **Managed Medicaid and Medicare Advantage payors**
    *   are demanding better ways to align incentives and share risk from their providers
*   **Pressure from state Medicaid agencies**
    *   to carve in BH to an "integrated" framework, requiring MCO's to take on difficult to treat and expensive SMI patients
*   **According to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), 58% of health systems listed equity as a top priority in 2021**
    *   This is a significant jump from 25% two years ago
*   **Managed Medicaid plans will need a SMI Solution**
    *   Our solution helps our Medicaid customers grow their member base and revenue, alongside reducing their MLR

## Slide 7: Amae Health is a value-based integrated care provider that treats behavioral health first

DocSend
7/23
AMAE Health

By focusing our treatment on a patient's primary diagnosis, their SMI, we can vastly improve their outcomes and also help treat their physical health comorbidities

*   **Flipping the treatment model to treat SMI as the primary condition**
    *   Just like a nephrologist is the lead clinician for a patient with chronic kidney disease, a psychiatrist should be the lead clinician for a patient with SMI
*   **Taking responsibility for treatment costs for patients with the highest needs**
    *   The primary driver of these patients' health outcomes and healthcare costs is their SMI. Physical health conditions are comorbidities that cannot be properly managed until the underlying SMI is treated
*   **Aligning incentives and delivering innovative clinical approaches for improved outcomes**
    *   Providing high resource treatments that FFS doesn't properly support:
        *   Long-acting injectables, Clozapine, IV Ketamine, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)
    *   Addressing SMI specific SDoH including:
        *   Substance abuse treatment, housing, employment, nutrition, sleep, and finding purpose and meaning

DocSend
9/23
AMAE Health

We intervene at a critical behavior change point and build trust through dedicated support for a patient's immediate needs

### Engage patient at the ED

Pre-discharge, an onsite Amae Engager (LCSW) meets with the patient at the ED and onboards them into our community

*   **Onboard and set up a care plan**
    *   We create an account for the patient, set up their care dashboard, receive consents and intake medical records to pair with claims data
*   **Care coordinator matching**
    *   Patient is matched with a care coordinator based on preferences, presenting symptoms, cultural competency, and medical history
*   **Housing facilitation**
    *   If needed, a living arrangement is provided based on their existing status and living conditions (eg. home-attendant for suicidal patient living alone)
*   **Telepsychiatry evaluation**
    *   When a psychiatrist is not available during a patient's hospitalization, we provide a telepsychiatry evaluation to expedite discharge

## Slide 10: Next, we provide delivery of holistic care

DocSend
10/23
AMAE Health

With a psychiatry-led model, we establish personalized treatment plans for patients' behavioral health, physical health and additional SDoH needs to vastly improve outcomes compared to existing solutions

### Clinical
*   **NP / GP**
*   **Medication Management**
*   **Psychologist**

Psychiatrist and the nurse practitioner / general physician work together to evaluate and establish a personalized medication and treatment plan including SUD treatment, comorbidity treatments, and medication side effect monitoring

**Connecting to:**
*   **Psychiatrist**
*   **Care Coordinator**

### Social Determinants of Health
*   **Support System**
*   **Housing**
*   **Community + Holistic Health**

Care coordinator (LCSW) acts as our patients' health "quarterback" and helps address critical social determinants of health including but not limited to: housing, nutrition, sleep, exercise, mindfulness, support system engagement, community integration

### Amae Prosperity Pact

*   **Amae Peer Mentor**
*   **Prosperity Pact**

*   Amae Patient is assigned an Amae Peer Mentor – an individual with SMI experience whom the patient can relate to and build trust with based on their condition
*   Peer mentor supports patient in completing their Amae Prosperity Pact – a set of measurable aims to re-establish meaning and purpose in a patient's life
*   Amae Patient will also be responsible for engaging in local community service efforts and volunteering in order to feel that they are contributing to their community and helping others

## Slide 13: We address core pain points across patients, providers and payors

DocSend
13/23
AMAE Health

Providing personalized and high-touch treatment that improves patient outcomes while lowering the total spend

### Patients
*   Provide a holistic treatment approach that directly addresses both the patient's SMI needs and their physical health needs
*   Deliver highly effective medications that are complex to administer & often not reimbursable in a FFS world
*   Focus on helping patients lead overall healthier and more meaningful lives

### Providers
*   Increase capacity for ED beds by alleviating them of SMI patients that are a loss driver as traditional billing does not cover the cost of care
*   Reduce hospital readmissions for these challenging patients, as SMI is the 2nd leading cause of 30-day readmissions for Medicaid patients
*   Alleviate physician burnout with this difficult to manage population by discharging patients faster

### Payors
*   Increase payors' membership via Medicaid assignment & Medicare Advantage open enrollment
*   Lower MLR by treating the SMI as the primary disease which then improves physical health comorbidities
*   Take on the patients that other risk providers carve out and provide a health equity solution

## Slide 21: Measurement-based methodologies to understand complex human behavior are increasingly more available

DocSend
21/23
AMAE Health

### The ways to measure complex human behavior are exploding

*   There is a huge catalog of well validated assessments to measure relevant aspects of human behavior and characteristics
*   Genetics is starting to develop a deep catalog of variants correlated with complex human characteristics and will continue to grow to include phenotypes related to treatment response
*   Digital health technology and wearables acquire a massive amount of data related to sleep, physical activity, and social behavior
*   Artificial Intelligence aims to use the massive quantity of data to shift prediction from populations to individuals

### Increasing role for measurement-based care in mental health treatment

*   Initial treatment planning: Population level evidence will be used to classify individuals based on genetics, biomarkers, demographics and baseline assessments to predict and refine an initial treatment plan
*   Adjunct treatment monitoring: Ongoing 'real-time' measurements can be used to inform adjustments to treatment
*   Wellness-monitoring: Continuous post-treatment measurement-based monitoring (activity, social interactions, sleep, biomarkers) can identify early evidence of symptom worsening and enable early interventions

## Slide 22: Future of leveraging measurement and data to enable precision medicine

DocSend
22/23
AMAE Health

### Conventional vs. Alternative Approach

*   Conventional psychiatric approach assigns a one-size-fits-all plan based predominantly on a diagnostic category
*   An alternative approach is to use measurement-based methods to:
    *   Define symptom targets
    *   Predict optimal treatment plan
    *   Monitor and adjust treatment course
    *   Maintain wellness

### Enabling focused and tailored treatment

*   Leverage denser data acquisition to identify patients as high risk for suicidality
*   Use our digital platform to increase communication bandwidth
*   Develop personalized treatment plans with specific targets (e.g. sleep quality and stress) to lower baseline risk
*   Build a research program to investigate basic science of suicide e.g. integrate clinical research with basic science
*   'Omics-approach to identify biomarkers of risk and resilience
