implementation, and other Professional Services. Orders for Professional Services will describe the applicable Professional Services, fees, costs and expenses payable by Customer to 32Health and any assumptions or dependencies relating to such Professional Services. 32Health will have no obligation to perform any Professional Services until an Order (or Statement of Work) for such Professional Services has been executed.

### 3.1. General.
Customer acknowledges and understands that use of the Services or Platform will permit or require Customer (or its users, including members or providers) to provide certain data, content, materials, and other information ("Customer Data") to 32Health for purposes of processing or storage. All Customer Data will be considered proprietary to Customer, as between the Parties, and Customer is responsible for obtaining any required consents from third parties relating to the provision of Customer Data to 32Health in connection with this Agreement. 32Health will only use Customer Data for performing the Services or Professional Services or as authorized under this Agreement. 32Health may aggregate and anonymize/de-identify any data or information relating to Customer Data ("De-Identified Data") to monitor, improve, or expand the Services, Platform or 32Health's commercial offerings, and/or use Customer Data to train and improve artificial intelligence algorithms and models ("AI Learnings"), as and if applicable, and subject to applicable laws and regulations.

## 4. PAYMENTS.

### 4.1. Fees and Expenses.
In consideration for the rights granted to Customer and the performance of 32Health's other obligations under this Agreement, Customer will pay to 32Health, without offset or deduction, the fees and expenses as determined under Schedule C of the Agreement. The fees for Professional Services will be based upon 32Health's standard professional fee rates then in effect, unless otherwise stated in an applicable Order. 32Health reserves the right to increase the fees each year after the Initial Subscription Term, but must provide notification of such increases at least thirty (30) days in advance. Unless otherwise provided in an Order, all such fees will be due and payable within thirty (30) calendar days after an invoice is issued by 32Health. Whenever any services are provided by 32Health at a Customer location or any other location requested by Customer other than one of 32Health's locations, Customer will reimburse 32Health for reasonable travel, lodging, meal and related expenses incurred by 32Health representatives in providing such services.

### 4.2. Taxes.
The fees and other amounts payable by Customer to 32Health do not include any taxes of any jurisdiction that may be assessed or imposed upon the Services, Platform, Documentation, Professional Services, or otherwise, including sales, use, excise, value added, personal property, export, import and withholding taxes, excluding only taxes based upon 32Health's net income. Customer will directly pay any such taxes assessed. Customer will promptly reimburse 32Health for any taxes payable or collectable by 32Health (other than taxes based upon 32Health's net income), unless Customer is exempt from taxes and provides valid documentation regarding its tax exempt status.

### 4.3. Payment Terms.
Fees and expenses will be invoiced by 32Health as set forth in the Order. All invoices will be sent to Customer's address for invoices as designated by Customer or, if not designated, then the address printed on this Agreement. If any Customer payment is more than thirty (30) days past due, interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum (or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by applicable law) will accrue, unless the non-payment is subject to a Good Faith Dispute. All fees and other amounts paid by Customer under this Agreement are non-refundable. All dollar amounts referred to in this Agreement are in United States Dollars. "Good Faith Dispute" means a good faith dispute by Customer of certain amounts invoiced under this Agreement. A Good Faith Dispute will be deemed to exist only if (a) Customer has given written notice of the dispute to 32Health promptly after receiving the invoice and (b) the notice explains Customer's position in reasonable detail. A Good Faith Dispute will not exist as to an invoice in its entirety merely because certain amounts on the invoice have been disputed.

## 5. WARRANTIES AND LIMITATIONS.

### 5.1. Performance Warranties.
The Services and Platform will perform as described in the then current Documentation in all material respects. The Professional Services will be performed in a good and workmanlike manner. Customer will timely notify 32Health of any known non-conformance to these warranties. 32Health's only obligation under these warranties is to correct any failure to so perform, or if such correction is not possible in a commercially reasonable timeframe, the breach of this warranty is material, and Customer elects to terminate for such uncured material breach, then 32Health will refund any fees paid for the specific non-conforming Services during the periods of non-conformance and refund any pre-paid fees for Services not provided. This section sets forth Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of this warranty.

### 5.2. Exclusions for Unauthorized Actions and Results of Use.
32Health will have no liability under any provision of this Agreement with respect to any performance problem, delay, or other matter to the extent attributable to any unauthorized or improper use or modification of the Services, Platform, Documentation, or Professional Services deliverables, any unauthorized combination with other services, deliverables, platforms, software, hardware, or technology, or any act or omission by Customer, its affiliates, or their users (including members or providers) or other representatives or contractors. Customer is solely responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Services, Platform, Documentation, and Professional Services, and will indemnify 32Health for any claims relating thereto, unless arising from 32Health's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

### 5.3. Disclaimer.
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED ABOVE IN THIS SECTION, THE SERVICES, PLATFORM, DOCUMENTATION, AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND 32HEALTH MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OF TRADE, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INTERFERENCE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. 32HEALTH MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, NOR WILL 32HEALTH HAVE ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO, ANY THIRD PARTY DATA, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

### 5.4. Limitation of Liability.

a) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOSS OF REVENUE, SAVINGS OR DATA) ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF ANY SERVICES, PLATFORM, DOCUMENTATION, OR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES BASED ON ANY THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

b) A PARTY'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL ORDERS WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY THE CUSTOMER TO 32HEALTH DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER(S) OR THIS AGREEMENT IF SUCH CLAIM DOES NOT RELATE TO A SPECIFIC ORDER. THIS IS AN AGGREGATE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND NOT A PER CLAIM OR INCIDENT LIMITATION.

c) THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN CLAUSE (B) WILL NOT APPLY TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION, THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE OF PROPRIETARY ITEMS, BREACHES WITH RESPECT TO PERSONAL INFORMATION OR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION, OR AMOUNTS FEES AND EXPENSES DUE AND PAYABLE TO 32HEALTH UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ORDER. WITH RESPECT TO 32HEALTH'S LIABILITY RELATING TO PERSONAL INFORMATION OR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION, ITS TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL ORDERS WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THREE TIMES THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY THE CUSTOMER TO 32HEALTH DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER(S) GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR THIS AGREEMENT

### 5.5. Other.
No action or claim of any type relating to this Agreement may be brought or made by Customer more than one (1) year after Customer first has knowledge of the basis for the action or claim. If any Services or rights to the Platform are provided on or for an evaluation, trial, or proof of concept basis, then Customer's sole remedy in connection therewith will be termination of the evaluation, trial or proof of concept.

## 6. CONFIDENTIALITY.

All Confidential Information of a Party ("Disclosing Party") in the possession of the other ("Receiving Party"), whether or not authorized, will be held in strict confidence, and the Receiving Party will take all steps reasonably necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party's Confidential Information will not be used or disclosed by the Receiving Party for any purpose except (a) as necessary to exercise rights or perform obligations under this Agreement, or (b) as required by law, provided that the other Party is given a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order. The Receiving Party will limit its use of and access to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to only those of its employees or representatives whose responsibilities require such use or access. The Receiving Party will advise all such employees and representatives, before they receive access to or possession of any of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and require them to abide by the terms of this Section. Either Party may disclose this Agreement to its actual or potential investors, creditors, professional advisors, or attorneys who are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

## 7. OWNERSHIP OF PROPRIETARY ITEMS.

### 7.1. General.
All Proprietary Items provided to or accessed by Customer under this Agreement are being made available on a strictly confidential and limited use basis in accordance with this Agreement and have great commercial value to 32Health. This Agreement is not an agreement of sale, and no title, patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, intellectual property or other ownership rights to any Proprietary Items are transferred to Customer under this Agreement. 32Health reserves all rights not expressly granted by this Agreement.

### 7.2. Title and Ownership.
All right, title, and interest in and to the Proprietary Items (including all related patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, intellectual property and other ownership rights) are and will remain the sole and exclusive

property of 32Health (or its licensors). Any derivative works, modifications, or enhancements relating to the Proprietary Items, De-identified Data or AI Learnings (whether created alone by either Party or jointly by or on behalf of both Parties or their representatives through Professional Services or otherwise) will be solely and exclusively owned by 32Health. Customer hereby assigns to 32Health any rights, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights in any feedback, suggestions, ideas, derivative works, modifications, enhancements, or improvements related to the Proprietary Items that Customer or any of its users or representatives provide, propose, create, conceive, author or develop relating to this Agreement or their use of the Services or Platform. Customer will execute and deliver (or cause its representatives to execute and deliver) any additional documents deemed reasonably necessary or appropriate to perfect, maintain, protect, or enforce 32Health's rights and the intent of this Agreement.

### 7.3. Customer Data and Proprietary Materials.
Customer retains all of its right, title and interest in and to Customer Data and Customer's internal systems, processes, and software, and the Proprietary Items do not include such Customer Data or Customer internal systems, processes, or software.

## 8. INDEMNIFICATION.

### 8.1. By 32Health.
32Health will defend, indemnify, and hold Customer harmless against all costs and reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damages, and liabilities arising out of any third party claim that any use of, or access to, the Proprietary Items by Customer as expressly authorized under this Agreement infringes or misappropriates, as applicable, any patents, copyrights, or trade secrets, provided that Customer gives 32Health (a) prompt written notice of such claim; (b) authority to control and direct the defense and/or settlement of such claim; and (c) such information and assistance as 32Health may reasonably request, at 32Health' expense, in connection with such defense and/or settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 32Health will have no obligation or liability to the extent that the alleged infringement or misappropriation arises from (1) the combination, operation, or use of the Proprietary Items with Customer Data or products, services, deliverables, materials, technologies, business methods or processes not furnished by 32Health; (2) modifications which were not made by 32Health; (3) Customer's breach of this Agreement or use of the Proprietary Items other than in accordance with this Agreement (collectively, “IP Exclusions"). Upon the occurrence of any claim for which indemnification is or may be due under this Section, or in the event that 32Health believes that such a claim is likely, 32Health may, at its option (i) modify the Proprietary Item so that it becomes non-infringing, or substitute functionally similar services, platforms, deliverables, or documentation; (ii) obtain a license to the applicable third-party intellectual property; or (iii) terminate this Agreement (or the applicable Orders) on written notice to Customer and refund to Customer any pre-paid fees for Services not provided. The obligations set forth in this Section will constitute 32Health's entire liability and Customer's sole remedy for any infringement or misappropriation.

### 8.2. By Customer.
Customer will indemnify, hold harmless, and, at 32Health's option, defend 32Health from and against all costs and reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damages, and liabilities arising out of any third party claim resulting from the IP Exclusions, Customer's use of the Services, Platform or Proprietary Items, or Customer Data (e.g., if Customer lacks adequate rights in or to Customer Data or such Customer Data is libelous, defamatory, or infringing), except to the extent the claim is subject to indemnification under Section 8.1 or 32Health's breach of its express obligations under this Agreement. 32Health agrees to give Customer: (a) prompt written notice of such claim; (b) authority to control and direct the defense and/or settlement of such claim; and (c) such information and assistance as Customer may reasonably request, at Customer's expense, in connection with such defense and/or settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer will not settle any third-party claim, unless such settlement completely and forever releases 32Health with respect thereto or unless 32Health provides its prior written consent to such settlement. In any action for which Customer provides defense on behalf of 32Health, 32Health may participate in such defense at its own expense by counsel of its choice.

## 9. TERMINATION.

### 9.1. General.
Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately on giving notice in writing to the other Party if the other Party commits a material breach (including any non-payment of fees due other than fees subject to a Good Faith Dispute) and, in the case of a material breach capable of being cured, failed to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after the receipt of a request in writing to cure such breach. Orders will be terminated if this Agreement is terminated or as otherwise provided in the applicable Order. This Agreement will be deemed terminated if there are no active Orders or all Subscription Terms have expired or terminated.

### 9.2. Post Termination Obligations.
Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, 32Health will perform its data

transfer obligations under Section 3.4 of the Agreement and Customer will: (a) discontinue all access and use of all Proprietary Items, (b) promptly return to 32Health all copies of the Documentation and any other Proprietary Items then in Customer's possession or control, and (c) give written notice to 32Health certifying that all copies of the Proprietary Information have been permanently deleted. Customer will remain liable for all payments due to 32Health with respect to the period ending on the date of termination (including a pro-rata portion for any periodic fees that had not been invoiced based on the extent to which Customer used the Services and Platform prior to termination). For any termination other than a termination for good cause by Customer in accordance with this Agreement, the balance of all remaining subscription fees relating to the then current Subscription Term will be due and payable. The provisions of Sections 3.4, 4, 5.2 - 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

## 10. OTHER PROVISIONS.

### 10.1. Export.
The Proprietary Items and related technology are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. Customer agrees not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from 32Health, or any products incorporating such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.

### 10.2. U.S. Government End Users.
The Services, Platform and related Documentation, are "commercial items" as defined in 48 CFR 2.101 and their use is subject to the policies set forth in 48 CFR 12.211, 48 CFR 12.212 and 48 CFR 227.7202, or any analogous provisions, as applicable.

### 10.3. No Assignment.
This Agreement, and Customer's rights and obligations, may not be assigned by Customer without 32Health's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. However, 32Health may assign in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or stock.

### 10.4. Force Majeure.
32Health will not be liable hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement on account of strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, fires, flood, storm, explosions, pandemics, acts of God, war, governmental action, labor conditions, earthquakes, material shortages or any other cause that is beyond the reasonable control of 32Health.

### 10.5. Relationship.
