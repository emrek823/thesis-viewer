### Preface

The AUA Annual Census, a comprehensive statistical approach to better understanding the urological workforce, urology providers' practice patterns, and various diversity and disparity issues in urology, was launched in 2014. This complex annual survey was designed to systematically collect statistically representative data about the urological workforce from multiple perspectives for use in supporting decision-making, policy development, and evidence-based research.

The AUA Annual Census has been structured as a two-part survey to support both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Base questions are designed to track trends on fundamental workforce factors such as geographical location, demographic characteristics, education and training, and urology practice patterns. While base questions are repeated each year, a set of new questions focusing on yearly priority topics identified by the AUA is added to each Annual Census. In 2022, the priority Census topic areas focused on practice business operations, access to care, selected urological conditions and treatments (overactive bladder, stress urinary incontinence, kidney stones, and prostate cancer), provider compensation, medical team and COVID-19-related topics.

The AUA Annual Census provides invaluable information to help fill knowledge gaps. Urological care providers, researchers and health policy decision-makers are encouraged to use the information in this report and past reports to inform their clinical practice, and fuel scientific research and the formation of health care policy. Public use data sets for current and previous years are available for use in AUA member-driven research studies.

Continuing the tradition, the 2023 AUA Annual Census will be launched by the end of April at the 2023 AUA Annual Meeting in Chicago and remain online through the end of September 2023. All urological community members are encouraged to participate to ensure that the AUA Annual Census remains representative and beneficial for AUA members.

### INTRODUCTION

The American Urological Association (AUA) is committed to providing education, research, advocacy and data required to address the increasing opportunities and challenges associated with providing quality urological care. These data about the urology workforce and practice patterns play an important role in generating knowledge that will inform urological care and policy impacting the urology workforce.

The AUA Annual Census is a primary data source that explores the profession of urology from multiple angles through the collection of information from practicing urologists and other professionals worldwide. Data collection for the 2022 AUA Annual Census began online in May 2022 and continued until the end of September 2022.

### DATA AND METHODS

#### Definition of the Urologist Population

Practicing urologists are defined as those with valid medical licenses reported in the National Provider Identifier (NPI) file who are listed as either urologists or pediatric urologists. Those who were reported as either surgeons or specialists in the NPI file and those who did not report a medical degree (MD or DO) were checked against the American Board of Urology (ABU) certification records maintained by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). The 2022 U.S. urologist population consists of a total of 13,976 practicing urologists excluding urologists in residency training.

#### Data Collection and Justification for Nonresponse

A total of 4,151 respondents completed the 2022 AUA Annual Census–3,101 of whom were from the United States. Of these, 1,918 Census respondents were validated to be practicing urologists in the United States and formed the Census sample data for analysis for this report.

The U.S. practicing urologist population file and the Census survey sample file were linked using post-stratification factors (i.e., gender, location, certification status, years since initial certification) to adjust for the nonresponse bias by the assigned proper sample weight.

### KEY FINDINGS

*   In 2022, 13,976 urologists were identified as "practicing urologists” in the U.S. Of those practicing urologists, 87.7% are “actively” practicing, meaning they devote at least 25 hours per week to clinical activities (TABLE 1-1).
*   Both the number of urologists and the urologist-to-population ratio, in the U.S., continued to increase between 2015 and 2021 at the national level (FIGURE 1-1). Among the 50 U.S. states, New York continued to be the state with the highest urologist-to-population ratio since 2021, while New Mexico became the state with the lowest ratio (TABLE 1-2).
*   The percentage of women practicing urologists continued to rise from 7.7% in 2014 to 11.6% in 2022 (FIGURE 2-1).
*   The numbers of practicing urologists with Hispanic ethnicity continued to increase from 584 (4.4%) in 2021 to 665 (4.9%) in 2022. However, the percentage of practicing urologists who identified as African American/Black race in the workforce has remained largely static (FIGURE 2-3, FIGURE 2-4).
*   Overall, 43.7% of practicing urologists completed at least one fellowship training during their career, which is 3.5% higher than the rate a year ago (TABLE 3-3). A higher percentage of women practicing urologists completed fellowship training compared to their men counterparts especially for those aged 45 and older (58.8% and 32.5%, respectively; FIGURE 3-1).
*   Nearly 80% of practicing urologists (79.7%) in the U.S. are certified by the American Board of Urology. (TABLE 3-6).
*   After annual decreases between 2017 and 2019, the percentage of practicing urologists who practiced in private settings (i.e., solo practices, single urology groups, multispecialty groups) has stabilized at around 51% since 2020 (FIGURE 4-1). The practicing urologists in private settings are more likely to be men (TABLE 4-2) and older in age (FIGURE 4-2).

## Page 8

*   The percentage of practicing urologists who worked directly with advanced practice providers within their practices increased to 81.5% in 2022 (TABLE 4-4) from 76.5% a year ago.
*   The practices where practicing urologists in the U.S. worked in 2022 were most likely to be owned by hospitals (45.0%), one urologist or a few urologists through partnership (16.4%) or large private urology groups (13.5%) (TABLE 4-5).
*   The median number of hours practicing urologists in the U.S. worked per week was 55. Thirty-five percent of them reported working more than 60 hours in a typical week (TABLE 5-1).
*   While men practicing urologists see more patients (73.5) in a typical week than women practicing urologists (62.9; FIGURE 5-3), women practicing urologists spend more time (19.0 minutes) with a patient during a typical office visit compared to their men counterparts (16.5 minutes; FIGURE 5-2).
*   Nearly 71% of practicing urologists in the U.S. have hospital call coverage at night and/or during the weekend (TABLE 6-1).
*   The average take-home pay for practicing urologists in the U.S. from clinical activities is $424K (TABLE 7-1).
*   Practicing urologists are likely to make higher pay if they are specialized in robotic surgery, pediatric urology, and oncology (TABLE 7-6) or if geographically they practice in Northeastern or North Central sections (TABLE 7-7).
*   Nearly 65% of practicing urologists in the U.S. see patients virtually for initial visits (TABLE 8-1) and 82% of practicing urologists in the U.S. see patients virtually for follow-up visits (TABLE 8-6).
*   About 39% of practicing urologists treat women patients with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) surgically (TABLE 9-7), predominantly using synthetic mid-urethral slings (TABLE 9-8).
*   More than 3 in 4 practicing urologists (77.7%) perform diagnostic prostate biopsies in patients (TABLE 9-24) and an increase was seen in the number using MRI-fusion biopsies, compared to three years ago (TABLE 9-25).
*   Nearly 39% of practicing urologists in the U.S. conduct research (TABLE 10-1). Women urologists, urologists under 55 of age, and urologists in academic institutions are more likely to do research (FIGURE 10-1, FIGURE 10-2 and TABLE 10-3).
*   The majority of practicing urologists (53.0%) contributed patient data to clinical trials, research projects or patient registries (TABLE 10-5).

### About the American Urological Association (AUA)

#### THE ORGANIZATION

Founded in 1902, the AUA is a premier urologic association, providing invaluable support to the urologic community.

#### AUA MISSION

The AUA mission is to promote the highest standards of urological clinical care through education, research and the formulation of health care policy.

#### AUA VISION

The AUA vision is to be the premier professional association for the advancement of professional urologic patient care.

### About the AUA Annual Census

The AUA supports the generation and dissemination of urological knowledge through a sophisticated statistical approach. The AUA's Annual Census is a systematically designed, specialty-representative survey of urology (like the U.S. Census). The results of the AUA's Annual Census are weighted to adjust for nonresponse bias to accurately represent the entire specialty and address the broad landscape of urology.

This publication serves as a primary source of information for the urology workforce in its effort to convey the needs and demands of the urological community effectively. The findings also depict workforce characteristics, current clinical practice, and recent educational and practicing trends, along with procedures to treat urological conditions. The results from this publication provide an array of information that can bridge knowledge gaps, provide data to meet increasing research needs and, ultimately, improve patient care. Besides publications on practicing urologists in the United States, publications on practicing urologists and urology residents across the globe are also available.

### Definition of Terms

#### PRACTICING STATUS

In order to understand the manner in which this report classifies urologists, a Definition of Terms is provided:

*   **UROLOGISTS:** Physicians and surgeons who are specially trained for the diagnosis and treatment of genitourinary and adrenal gland diseases in patients of any age and of either sex
*   **PRACTICING UROLOGISTS:** Urologists who maintain current medical licensures and treat patients with urologic conditions
*   **PRACTICING UROLOGISTS IN THE UNITED STATES:** Practicing urologists with primary practice locations in at least one of the 50 United States or the District of Columbia.
*   **ACTIVE PRACTICING UROLOGISTS:** Practicing urologists who treat patients with urologic conditions and who work at least 25 clinical hours per week
*   **CERTIFIED UROLOGISTS:** Urologists who are certified by the American Board of Urology

#### LEVEL OF RURALITY

The ZIP code of each practicing urologist's primary practice location was converted to a rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) code based on RUCA3.10 (developed collaboratively by the Health Resources and Service Administration's Office of Rural Health Policy, the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, the WWAMI [Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho] Rural Health Research Center based on 2010 United States Census work-commuting data and 2012 United States Census Bureau revised urban area definition based on 2010 Census data and 2013 ZIP codes).

RUCA3.10 codes were grouped into four levels of rurality. An area with a population size ≥ 50,000 was defined as a Metropolitan Area. An area with a population size <50,000 was defined as a Nonmetropolitan Area. The Nonmetropolitan Area was further classified: Micropolitan Area (population 10,000-49,999), Small Town (population 2,500-9,999) and Rural Area (population <2,500).

### Methodology

Data in the AUA Annual Census were collected and analyzed using the survey methodology developed by Groves et al. Two data files were established. One file was a population file containing basic demographic, geographic and certification information for all practicing urologists in the U.S. in 2022. The other file was a sample data file containing a broad range of information collected from the Census. The population file and the Census survey sample file were linked through post-stratification factors to adjust for nonresponses and each respondent's contribution in a Census survey by assigned sample weight.

### PRACTICING UROLOGIST POPULATION

Practicing urologists were identified jointly from the NPI file (which includes all physicians in the U.S. who hold valid medical licenses) and ABU certification records maintained by the ABMS if the following criteria were met:

*   Either urology or pediatric urology was listed as the medical specialty.
*   A provider was listed as a surgeon or a specialist and matched to either the 2022 ABU certification records as a urologist or the AOBS certification records as a urological surgeon. Manual checks of all individual urologists' and urological surgeons' websites were performed to confirm that these physicians provided urological care in 2022.
*   Urologists in residency training were excluded from this report.
*   Additionally, urologists who were identified as certified by the ABU but not listed in the NPI file were excluded in order to ensure the inclusion of only currently practicing urologists.

### ORGANIZATION OF QUESTIONS

The Census consists of “base” and “supplemental” questions. Base questions that target the entire urology specialty will be asked annually in order to identify cross-sectional and longitudinal patterns. Examples of base question topics include practice status, clinical practice setting, primary and secondary subspecialties, patient encounters and employment status. Supplemental questions will vary each year and focus on emerging issues; these questions may be distributed to all participants or a random subset of participants.

### CENSUS TIMELINE

The AUA Annual Census officially launches in May and is available online to respondents through September of that same year. Census data are analyzed and reported in the annual publication, The State of the Urology Workforce and Practice in the United States, which is available in spring of the following year.

### CENSUS DATA COLLECTION

Data collection for the 2022 AUA Annual Census began on May 2, 2022 and ended on September 30, 2022. Each respondent was assigned an identification number prior to the submission of responses to the Census questions. This step ensured the results could be linked to the population file and no respondent could take the survey more than once.

A total of 4,151 respondents completed the 2022 AUA Annual Census–1,918 of whom were practicing urologists in the U.S. Those who self-reported as practicing urologists were checked against the practicing urologist population file and removed if there were no matches found. Those urologists who were either practicing outside the U.S. or in residency training were removed from this study. The responses from the practicing urologists outside the U.S. were analyzed and reported separately later.

## Page 12

### SAMPLE WEIGHTING

To adjust for non-responses and resulting biases in the 2022 AUA Census sample, a standard post-stratification weighting technique was used to identify post-stratification factors. Identified factors include gender, geographic location, certification status and years since initial certification. These factors are used to develop stratification cells for calculating sample weights.

### CENSUS REPORTING WITH STATISTICAL CONFIDENCE

Results were based on either the practicing urologist population data (Section 1) or weighted Census samples (Sections 2 through 10) described earlier in this report. Reported statistics based on the population data were preferred, given the lack of sampling bias. In contrast, when reported findings were based on weighted Census samples, error estimates were reported in the form of either a margin of error (MOE) or a confidence interval (CI), with an estimation of measurement precision at a 90% level of confidence.

### DATA ANALYSIS

After the post-stratification weighting adjustment, the Census data were analyzed with IBM-SPSS Complex Samples 27.0.

### MARGIN OF ERROR (MOE)

Estimates of characteristics of the practicing urologists, from the AUA Census sample data, can differ from those that would be obtained if all practicing urologists were surveyed. MOE values at the 90% confidence level were used to measure and report the precision of each estimate. The MOE is the difference between an estimate and its upper and lower confidence bounds. The AUA reports both estimates and their associated MOE values in alignment with how this information is reported in the U.S. Census/American Community Survey.

### CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI)

Estimates based on the AUA Census samples can differ from those that would be obtained if all practicing urologists were surveyed. A 90% confidence interval (90% CI) was used to mark the upper and lower confidence bounds of the estimated parameter by Census samples with 90% statistical confidence.

### LIMITATIONS

The results of the AUA Annual Census are subject to the following limitations:

*   As a population-based and weighted survey, the AUA Annual Census data analysis relied on the absolute number of responses to report statistics for small geographic, demographic and clinical categories. Racial/ethnic minority groups were not well represented in the urologist population and, therefore, were difficult to analyze.
*   The AUA Annual Census is subject to sampling and estimate errors. Thus, the MOE is the appropriate tool used for comparing two groups.
*   The practicing urologist population in the U.S. was based on the assumption that urologists who maintain their medical licenses in the Census year are considered practicing urologists.
*   Geographic classifications, such as rurality levels and state, were determined based on the primary office location in the NPI file. The actual geographic coverage for each practicing urologist may extend beyond the area reported.
*   Census data are self-reported, nonvalidated and subject to bias or misrepresentation.

### Section 1: Geographic Distribution

#### Primary Observations

*   In 2022, 13,976 urologists were identified as "practicing urologists” in the U.S. Of those practicing urologists, 87.7% are “actively” practicing, meaning they devote at least 25 hours per week to clinical activities (TABLE 1-1).
*   Both the number of urologists and the urologist-to-population ratio, in the U.S., continued to increase between 2015 and 2021 at the national level (FIGURE 1-1). Among the 50 U.S. states, New York continued to be the state with the highest urologist-to-population ratio since 2021, while New Mexico became the state with the lowest ratio (TABLE 1-2).
*   Ten percent of practicing urologists in the U.S. maintained their primary practices outside of metropolitan areas (TABLE 1-5). The likelihood of practicing urologists maintaining their primary practice locations in nonmetropolitan areas increased with age (FIGURE 1-6).

#### TABLE 1-1 Practicing Status

| Practicing Status          | Number | Percent (%) | +/- MOE (%) |
| :------------------------- | :----- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Total Practicing Urologists | 13,976 | 100.0       | N/A         |
| Active Practicing Urologists | 12,253 | 87.7        | 1.5         |

Data sources: National Provider Identifier 09/2022 file, ABU certification records from the ABMS Directory of Board-Certified Medical Specialists, and AUA 2022 Annual Census.
N/A indicates the total number of practicing urologists was determined by AUA urologist master file rather than by a sample estimate.
Active practicing urologists are defined as those who work 25 or more clinical hours per week.

### Section 3: Professional Preparation and Credentialing

#### Primary Observations

*   Overall, 43.7% of practicing urologists completed at least one fellowship training during their career, which is 3.5% higher than the rate a year ago (TABLE 3-3). A higher percentage of women practicing urologists completed fellowship training compared to their men counterparts especially for those aged 45 and older (58.8% and 32.5%, respectively; FIGURE 3-1).
*   Oncology (13.0%), Robotic Surgery (8.2%), and endourology/stone disease (8.0%) were the top three areas of fellowship training reported in 2022 (TABLE 3-4).
*   Nearly 80% of practicing urologists (79.7%) in the U.S. are certified by the American Board of Urology. (TABLE 3-6).

### Section 4: Urology Practice Characteristics and Performance Assessment

#### Primary Observations

*   After annual decreases between 2017 and 2019, the percentage of practicing urologists who practiced in private settings (i.e., solo practices, single urology groups, multispecialty groups) has stabilized at around 51% since 2020 (FIGURE 4-1). The practicing urologists in private settings are more likely to be men (TABLE 4-2) and older in age (FIGURE 4-2).
*   The percentage of practicing urologists who worked directly with advanced practice providers within their practices increased to 81.5% in 2022 (TABLE 4-4) from 76.5% a year ago.
*   The practices where practicing urologists in the U.S. worked in 2022 were most likely to be owned by hospitals (45.0%), one urologist or a few urologists through partnership (16.4%) or large private urology groups (13.5%) (TABLE 4-5).

### Section 5: Volume, Scope, Location and Duration of Work

#### Primary Observations

*   The median number of hours practicing urologists in the U.S. worked per week was 55. Thirty-five percent of them reported working more than 60 hours in a typical week (TABLE 5-1).
*   While men practicing urologists see more patients (73.5) in a typical week than women practicing urologists (62.9; FIGURE 5-3), women practicing urologists spend more time (19.0 minutes) with a patient during a typical office visit compared to their men counterparts (16.5 minutes; FIGURE 5-2).
*   The median number of years practicing urologists in the U.S. are at their current job is 8, while the median number of different practices the U.S. practicing urologists have worked since finishing residency is 2 (TABLE 5-8, TABLE 5-9).

### Section 6: Hospital Call Coverage

#### Primary Observations

*   Nearly 71% of practicing urologists in the U.S. have hospital call coverage at night and/or during the weekend (TABLE 6-1).
*   Nearly 62% of practicing urologists who have night/weekend hospital call coverage do not receive separate payment for their hospital night calls on weekdays or weekend hospital calls (TABLE 6-9, TABLE 6-10).
*   Approximately 70% of practicing urologists have call coverage at one or two hospitals (TABLE 6-11).

### Section 7: Compensation and Employment-Related Topics

#### Primary Observations

*   The average take-home pay for practicing urologists in the U.S. from clinical activities is $424K (TABLE 7-1).
*   Practicing urologists of Hispanic origin have statistically higher average take-home pay from clinical activities than those of non-Hispanic origin ($469K vs $422K) [TABLE 7-2]. No significant difference in pay was seen across race groups (TABLE 7-3).
*   Practicing urologists are likely to make higher pay if they are specialized in robotic surgery, pediatric urology, and oncology (TABLE 7-6) or if geographically they practice in Northeastern or North Central sections (TABLE 7-7).

### Section 8: Telemedicine

#### Primary Observations

*   Nearly 65% of practicing urologists in the U.S. see patients virtually for initial visits (TABLE 8-1) and 82% of practicing urologists in the U.S. see patients virtually for follow-up visits (TABLE 8-6).
*   Higher utilization of telemedicine is associated with practicing in metropolitan areas (TABLE 8-2, TABLE 8-7), being under age of 55 (TABLE 8-3), in larger practices (TABLE 8-4, TABLE 8-9) and in practices with more advanced practice providers (TABLE 8-5, TABLE 8-10).
*   Practicing urologists would like to see guidelines for telemedicine for the following top five diseases: Hematuria, Elevated PSA/Prostate Cancer, Urinary Tract Stones, BPH and Erectile Dysfunction (TABLE 8-16).

### Section 9: Selected Urological Conditions

#### Primary Observations

*   Nearly 82% of practicing urologists in the U.S. perform orchiectomy or orchidopexy (TABLE 9-1).
*   About 39% of practicing urologists treat female patients with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) surgically (TABLE 9-7), predominantly using synthetic mid-urethral slings (TABLE 9-8).
*   More than 3 in 4 practicing urologists (77.7%) perform diagnostic prostate biopsies in patients (TABLE 9-24) and an increase was seen in the number using MRI-fusion biopsies, compared to three years ago (TABLE 9-25).

### Section 10: Research

#### Primary Observations

*   Nearly 39% of practicing urologists in the U.S. conduct research (TABLE 10-1). Women urologists, urologists under 55 of age, and urologists in academic institutions are more likely to do research (FIGURE 10-1, FIGURE 10-2 and TABLE 10-3).
*   Regarding primary type of research, a vast majority (72.7%) of practicing urologists who do research conduct clinical research (TABLE 10-4).
*   The majority of practicing urologists (53.0%) contributed patient data to clinical trials, research projects or patient registries (TABLE 10-5).
