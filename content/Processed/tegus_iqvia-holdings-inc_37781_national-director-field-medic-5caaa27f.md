# IQVIA Holdings Inc - National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical

Interview conducted on July 12, 2022

## Topics
Medical Affairs, Veeva, Pharmaceutical Industry, Commercial Launch, Vendor Selection, Compliance

## Summary
In a conversation between a Tegus Client and a National Director of Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical, the National Director discusses their experience in the pharma industry and the role of their medical team in supporting trial sites and patient enrollment. They also explain the process of identifying and managing Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) using databases and mapping tools, and their dissatisfaction with the Veeva platform. The National Director emphasizes the importance of selecting vendors based on ease of use and cost-effectiveness, and notes that big pharma typically uses big box outfits while small biotechs use cheaper out-of-the-box solutions. The National Director also suggests that outsourcing consulting to vendors may be a way to blame them for any issues that arise.

## Tegus Client
Hello. Thanks for your time. We're looking to learn a little bit more about the commercialization space for biopharma and life sciences. So maybe if you want to give us a quick introduction, just what your experience over the past few years has been in pharma and in the commercial process in biopharma.

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Sure. So I had a field medical team here at Horizon Therapeutics. I've worked in the pharma industry since 2002, launched 10-plus drugs. I worked very closely with our commercial colleagues. I can tell you, I moved over from Sanofi-Genzyme three years ago to Viela Bio, a small pharmaceutical company that basically took a drug from Phase I, II, III all the way through to commercialization.

So as a part of that piece of commercialization, worked very closely with our Chief Commercial Officer, Chief Medical Officer, all those folks to really take this to the last stage. And we got bought out about a year ago, Viela Bio got bought out by Horizon.

And natalizumab was the drug that we actually marketed, it was on the market as of June of 2020 in a COVID world. So we launched a drug actually in the COVID world. So I helped with filing of all of our different documents.

I didn't file the documents, I looked over the documents, made sure they were good, looked at what kind of approvals we can get. So we got it for a neurology indication for NMOSD, and we put a bunch of stuff forward through to the FDA, and we were somewhat successful, not fully successful in what we wanted.

The good part was we have a drug within three drugs that are in the market. We don't have a black box warning or a warning in general. So that's good. It takes a lot to go through that as well. So that's kind of where we're at today. It's been on the market since 2020.

Similar to that, I worked on an MS product, took that to commercialization as well. Usually, they're a consultant from the medical side, telling them kind of scientifically what we can do, all that good stuff.

## Tegus Client
That's super interesting. Look to hear a little bit more about that. But I think maybe if you can tell us more about your current role at Horizon, what your day-to-day looks like, what your responsibilities are, what you're overseeing, that would be good.

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
So right now, I manage a team of medical directors that are in the United States. So I have a team of seven field medical directors that essentially are kind of doing everything from helping out their commercial counterparts, their thought leader liaisons through to get patients on therapy essentially.

So they input patient enrollment forms. We do follow-ups to that as well. We also have been working on our Phase IV study in pregnancy and another Phase IV study as well in long term. So essentially, we're working on lots of different things.

We also work on some of our pipelines as well and market access. So we're essentially the jack of all trades as we can talk about anything that's not associated with the package insert is essentially what it is. Any time we get any questions, we can ask those, we can refer back to parts of the trial that we did, we can refer back to what other physicians are telling us. So we have a lot of aspects of what we can talk about as long as we're typically asked.

## Tegus Client
Very interesting. Maybe if we can dive in mostly on the commercial use cases, your relevance with the commercial team as well as the work that you do managing the medical directors. We're looking to learn a little bit more about what the Med Affairs team experiences like what type of work the medical directors and MSLs are doing as well as like how it ties into the commercial launch and ongoing commercial brand management.

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So essentially, as you probably already know, your commercial teams are basically bound by your package inserts. So essentially, they're bound by that package insert, they really can't go off of the package insert, where the medical team can come in and essentially talk about whatever is needed to help bolster the effects of what was happening.

So for us, by example, we didn't get it within our package insert a disability indication. Although any time the sales reps can go in and talk they say that we have some secondary measures that are not included in the label, if you want to discuss those essentially your medical person can actually come in and talk about those secondary measures.

Now the commercial teams can actually go through the government agencies to make sure that we can talk about those things since they're not in the package insert, but it really just has to do with the FDA, whether they allow it or not within the marketing materials.

## Tegus Client
So backing up just a little bit here. So I know you mentioned you've worked on a couple of different drugs in a couple of different areas. What are the different phases when it comes to a commercial launch of a drug, whether it's prelaunch strategy, active launch activation and execution as well as ongoing brand management through LOE, have you interacted with and how have those experiences differed with regards to the way the Med Affairs team is working, what the responsibilities are and as well as your interactions with the commercial team?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So all the companies that I work for, there's always a commercial counterpart that works on the pipeline. So there's one commercial development person who works on the pipeline and they follow these products through the phases.

So obviously, Phase I is out. So all of your Phase I is animal studies, all that good stuff. So we basically come in. Now medical affairs always comes in about 18 months. Most companies that I worked for, we usually come in 18 months before the launch of the product.

So we work very closely with our commercialization colleagues to make sure that we are prepping the market for the launch. We are doing ad boards. We are doing marketing research to find out what that market is like and making sure that we have stuff within our trial that can address all of those issues.

So as I've worked on all these brands, we always start sometimes 24 months ahead. So 18 to 24 months ahead, years ago, I was at Sanofi and MS and took Aubagio from premarket. So after their Phase III was done, but we were involved in the Phase III.

Typically, your medical teams are involved in a Phase II, Phase III from a standpoint of trial sites, making sure they support those trial sites, making sure they have good relationships with all the physicians that are within the trial so that when we launch, those are your core group of folks.

Those are the people that you're asking a lot of questions of and then when you launch, you have a good background to launch into. Unfortunately, some companies don't put a lot of sites within the United States. So that's a drawback.

If you don't have enough sites within the United States, you risk launching into the United States where you don't have a lot of support -- good example, Biogen launched TECFIDERA in the U.S., they had tons of sites. So they had a huge demand when the drug actually was launched.

OCREVUS had the same thing. Patients were actually waiting in the kind of wings, as I recall it to get on therapy as soon as it launched. So all of the prep had been going on 18 months beforehand like I said, ad boards, all your medical colleague will be going in and talk about we all can talk about disease state.

Sales reps also can talk about disease state. You may do disease state programs. And then when you get prompted, the medical folks can talk about the trials if they get prompted about a Phase II or Phase III trial.

Page 3 of 15

So that's kind of the differentiation. Sales reps cannot talk about the trial until it's launched until it's been approved by the FDA, where the medical folks can. So that's the advantage of having a medical team as they can answer those questions.

## Tegus Client
And is the medical team actually responsible for identifying and deciding sort of how many sites are being selected? Is that also the responsibility of the medical team? Or does that fit sort of typically with commercial?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
So technically it's part of R&D. So R&D owns that piece and every company that I work for R&D really owns that piece. Now, commercial should have a hand in that matter, along with the medical affairs group. So at the end of the day, R&D is responsible.

And I've seen over the years where originally a big pharma company had their own research organizations in-house. I've started to see that all go away. It's all farmed out. So you're looking at now PPD or Medpace or Quintiles are running these trials.

So to tell you the truth, unfortunately, they're using a lot of these agencies to find sites instead of getting the input, especially if you come from a small biotech. So I came from a small biotech, where all these sites were already done prior to me coming in, where I wouldn't have chosen all of the sites that they chose.

But they chose them because of the fact that they're great enrollers, they have a good history. They're a clean work, they don't have any notifications on their records. So that's how that typically works. Commercial doesn't usually get that involved in the site identification in Phase II and Phase III.

## Tegus Client
Got it. So a quick question here is how this relates to post-market and post-drug approval. So are those sites that the trials are typically run and the sites that are identified, are they the initial source of truth for where you identify thought leaders and KOLs for the market activity? Or is that entire KOL identification and engagement management piece done more separately?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
No, you're right. It's a subset. I would say probably 30% of your sites are usually looked at as your high-level folks. So you pick a good handful of people where they're the big academic institutions where they're going to get the most gravitas in wherever you are.

And then they fill them in with sites where they can enroll most patients. And tell you the truth and you'll see this across industry. So if you look at Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. That was a powerhouse for getting sites, and that's a huge thing that's happened in the industry right now.

It's because a lot of patients don't have access to the drugs out in those countries, and it's very easy to enroll. So it's very easy to enroll outside of the U.S. The U.S. is a very crowded market typically, depending on your therapeutic area.

## Tegus Client
Just want to clarify. When it comes to the sites within the U.S. or sites outside of the U.S. that are actively participating in the trial enrolling patients are the PIs that are in charge of those sites or any other physicians that are at the sites the ones that you go to post market.

Like post-market approval and during commercial launch, those are the ones that med affairs team is currently engaging with, okay. Is that like the majority of the KOLs that you identify? Or is that just a starting point and then you identify different sets of folks from?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
That is absolutely just a starting point. So if I looked at a recent trial in MG, you may only have 20 U.S. sites,

THIS DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE REPRODUCED, DISTRIBUTED, OR TRANSMITTED IN ANY FORM OR BY ANY MEANS INCLUDING RESALE OF ANY PART, UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION TO A THIRD PARTY OR OTHER METHODS, WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF TEGUS INC.

Page 4 of 15

but there's probably 900 providers that may be prescribing myasthenia gravis. So those are such a small sliver.

Now obviously, hopefully, your main PI is your biggest spokesperson in the U.S. like I'll tell you, I mean everybody knows is our Phase II/III trial for NMOSD was Bruce Cree, where he's the biggest name in neurology for MS and NMOSD.

So you hope to have somebody who captures and then everybody kind of follows through. And those people, you use post marketing for a lot of your posters and publications. So that's how you use a lot of those folks. And then you start to use other folks outside of your core group of investigators. That's a starting point. For sure, it's a starting point.

## Tegus Client
Got you. So I want to dig in a little bit more here into both what you get and how the relationship is between the Med Affairs team and the KOLs that you identified during trials as well as post market. And what that relationship looks like and what they're responsible for.

How much value you get and how much content and engagement you get from those high-value PIs versus other PIs that you identify and backfill with -- and on the flip side, how you manage that entire process? Like what tools are in place to help facilitate that? How do you know who to pick and who to talk to, things like that?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So you have your core list of people that are in your trial, you use your main PI, you use some of your other PIs. You do steering committee meetings throughout your trial, throughout your Phase II and Phase III. Typically, your folks that are enrolling kind of the best, you may use those folks when you launch.

You continue to use all of those folks to generate the buzz. So hopefully, you've gotten the right PIs in your trial so that when you launch, they're your experts that everybody is looking to them that continue on. And the MSL or we call them regional medical directors where I work, that relationship starts early on.

Now obviously, R&D has their relationship with these folks. So you're Head of R&D, whosever part of that study has a very close relationship with all of those sites and then your RMDs or MSLs will be at least most companies I've come from, you're seeing them about once a quarter.

I can tell you that some see them more often depending on the sites. The relationship is very close that when you launch the drug, you may use the same folks to be speakers for you depending on if they're coming from an institution that allows that.

But typically, these are the folks you have to use because they have the most experience and then their patients typically go on drug. They specifically go on paid drug. They're not on study drug any longer. So they're your core group of folks.

So essentially, you're using the same physicians and the relationship is very close to the MSL R&D. Typically, your sales reps and your sales reps don't have their relationships unless they're in that area. There's a drug that you're working on in that area already. Typically, they won't have those relationships, the close relationships, the medical affairs team or the R&D team would have.

## Tegus Client
So does that mean that a lot of the folks that the MSLs are engaging with are through relationships inherited from R&D's connections within the industry? Or are a lot of them, like if it's a new drug and a new indication that the company has never pursued before, are these de novo sourced relationships and de novo sourced like providers and prescribers and KOLs that you're reaching out to as part of the med affairs effort pretty close to launch and after launch?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So I'll give you a perfect example. We're working in MG. And most of my team does not really of all of

THIS DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE REPRODUCED, DISTRIBUTED, OR TRANSMITTED IN ANY FORM OR BY ANY MEANS INCLUDING RESALE OF ANY PART, UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION TO A THIRD PARTY OR OTHER METHODS, WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF TEGUS INC.

Page 5 of 15

ours, probably 90% we do not have current relationships with, and we're actually going in and starting to have those relationships as we launch in two or three years.

So yes, unless you were in that area, let's say you were in MS and you had another drug you're working for in MS. So perfect example if Sanofi has already two MS products that are on the market, they've got a BTK inhibitor in a Phase III.

That MSL team is very closely working with each one of those sites, and they've already known these folks for years because we launched two MS products in that space. So it just depends whether you're in that space or not.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And let's say, you're not inheriting any relationships from R&D. You never worked in the space prior. You have a small number of, let's say, in an indication like MG, you have a small number of sites, a small number of sort of PIs. How do you sort of then go about building your network of KOL sort of what is the identification and sort of what does the process look like?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Sure. So one of the first steps is we need these sites through our CRAs, our clinical research associates, we always meet them through the CRAs if we can, as those are the folks that are essentially going into the site very regularly.

They typically give us an introduction, then we start to develop that relationship. As we start to develop that relationship with those physicians, we may ask them who their sphere of influence is, obviously, not that blunt or we also have certain databases that we can use, so Veeva has one that actually does mapping.

There's another one though. I'm trying to think of the one we've used as we launched into NMOSD, we used a database that looked at all of your top-tiered KOLs or neurologists in the space, and then you also have IQVIA data, which typically all of my teams have used over the years and looking at IQVIA data.

So people that have prescribed MS or NMOSD and then you drill down even further into that. So you have a couple of ways to do it, but it's typically through physicians may tell you who they know, who they think are the top folks. But really, at the end of the day, you may have to go to some of that IQVIA data, which shows you all the prescribing habits for that area.

## Tegus Client
We're pretty interested in this area as well, like tools that you're currently using to figure out who the folks are that are prescribing as well as what the share of use of those tools is. So given that there's a lot of things out there that can do this, there's IQVIA claims data that everyone seems to be using.

There's the Veevas and there's some of these other analytics folks like Komodo or whoever else, how do you see the value between each of these different methods as well as just physician word-of-mouth referral in different indications.

They're also experts in their own right. So how do you see the value of these different tools that they provide to you? And what would you say is helpful versus maybe fairly trivial when it comes to their offerings.

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So we used one early on, and the one slipping my mind, which one we used, it was basically mapping. And the issue with that tool was essentially, I could pull up all the thought leaders, but half the thought leaders were in my company.

The first top 10 people were all worked for Viela Bio. So it was a bit ridiculous and they didn't sort through these and get those folks off of the list. IQVIA really has one of the better ones because they have a mapping that really ties back to all these physicians prescribing.

Of course, we have KOLs that don't prescribe. So you will have a few folks within your trials that may not

THIS DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE REPRODUCED, DISTRIBUTED, OR TRANSMITTED IN ANY FORM OR BY ANY MEANS INCLUDING RESALE OF ANY PART, UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION TO A THIRD PARTY OR OTHER METHODS, WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF TEGUS INC.

Page 6 of 15

prescribe maybe they're so high level, they don't really prescribe much. But at the end of the day, you want the folks that are prescribing those drugs.

And IQVIA has that data. Hence, why they've kind of cornered the market. Veeva, they're not good at it. They're not very good at a lot of things. But they're not good at that piece. And the easiest way is it's almost kind of like give you the list and hone down on what is it that you're needing.

So at the end of the day, the academic institution, who are the folks within that academic institution that are prescribing or seeing those patients. And that's really difficult. I don't know any provider that's been able to really time that out, any technology.

## Tegus Client
Super interesting. So I want to touch on two things there. One, maybe we can come back to this, but just your thoughts on IQVIA and how their products have been and helping you guys find and manage payroll relationship sounds like pretty good. But first, maybe you want to touch more on Veeva.

As folks who are interested in the commercial space and how this is supplied to life science teams, obviously, Veeva is everywhere in this space, they have so many different offerings. What has your experience been with Veeva? First, what period has the experience in Veeva, which product offerings and use cases, but also how were they and would love to hear more about that.

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
So I've worked with Veeva for 15 years. I actually developed our program at Sanofi-Genzyme, for commercial and medical and kind of parsing out what we're going to use. And I will tell you that it's not great. It is one of my least favorite platforms. I don't know why all these companies use Veeva, I guess, because they promise so many things but they underdeliver. I hate to tell you, but they promise the world and they never deliver, anything they use.

It's not great. I hate to say that, but it's really bad. And I guess there's no other solution because every company uses Veeva. I mean there's SteepRock, which I've used SteepRock in the past. I used other things. But the unfortunate part is Veeva doesn't really have an out-of-the-box. So they do have a very generic system.

But if you go through their intuitive system where you kind of create your own, it is a very long process. For nonsense, it's really a bean-counting method, half the time you can't find your physicians within the system or there's duplicates, you have to pull them down and then this is only a U.S. thing.

If you do anything outside the U.S., it's so different, so you can't really use that system. We currently at Horizon have a totally different system on Veeva called MedView. So we have a medical version that doesn't really even connect to the commercial version. So yes, you can see that I'm not a positive fan of Veeva, I really don't give anything you need out of it.

## Tegus Client
And this is really interesting. I would love to sort of double-click on that particular piece. So you said you're using this MedView module, which doesn't connect to commercial. So could you explain a little bit sort of what the module allows you to do in med affairs because ultimately, Veeva was made for marketers, right?

And so they've added on all these add-ons over time. What is it that the platform, the MedView platform allows you to do? And how is it different to sort of the other parts of the Veeva system that you've used in that sort of being tailored specifically for med affairs folks?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So at Sanofi, when we put our Veeva together, we essentially spoke. So when commercial and medical put their interactions and you could find that somebody had an interaction on a certain date. So I could look at a physician and see that my commercial colleague, whoever maybe had a meeting on the 17th of the month.

THIS DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE REPRODUCED, DISTRIBUTED, OR TRANSMITTED IN ANY FORM OR BY ANY MEANS INCLUDING RESALE OF ANY PART, UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION TO A THIRD PARTY OR OTHER METHODS, WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF TEGUS INC.

Page 7 of 15

So there was a connection there. They could put a medical information request through the system and it came to us or it went to medical info. Now the system that I work with, they're not connected. So I can't really see what my commercial colleagues are doing.

So there's nothing I could see except the medical information request if they send it to me. So this system that I work with that is very detail oriented, there's new things and they change the system constantly. But the unfortunate part is any time you want to change drop-downs or radio buttons, it's quite a long process to do and Veeva charges you so much money for every little thing.

I've seen that at Sanofi, I've seen that at Horizon. Now Viela, we had an out-of-box Veeva that we used. So I had a contract team that came in and then we got rid of that contract team and hired my own team. And that Veeva was essentially as basic as basic gets, look up the physician, you had a meeting, you kind of said what it was, and that was it. That's how we used Veeva.

But none of the Veevas give you really any reports, you have to develop your own reports. So unfortunately, it's not user-friendly. You got to spend a lot of money. We have three analysts that work with my team to do. They work with three teams, and there's three separate analysts that work on this. That's how many people just help us with reporting out what's going into Veeva. It's crazy.

## Tegus Client
So right now, at Horizon, are you still sticking with the lightweight Veeva instance that you previously at Viela? And I guess a broader question here, what do you think you would do to fix this?

Obviously, there's a connectivity issue between the commercial folks and the med affairs folks. But is there anything else that you wish the system had or abilities that you think you would write into the system that you could do? What do you wish it look like today?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
At the end of the day, the only way you can get on Veeva is through an iPad or a computer. They don't have access to an iPhone or any phone, I mean at the end of the day, we're in 2022, and you can't log this stuff into a simple phone like it's crazy to me that we're this far along, I mean, I'm telling you it's a bean counter, it's literally, this is a physician, this is what I did. How many minutes was I at that interaction?

I mean nobody allows anybody to put notes into the system. Nobody is allowed to put notes into the system. So you pay for a widget that you're not even using a lot of the functionality. We use a little bit higher intensity Veeva here at Horizon from the Viela, so Viela, they scrapped our program and actually already had their own.

So we came on to theirs, but it's still not much different than what I already had. I mean if you talk to any MSL across the board or even any sales rep, they'll probably tell you that this is their biggest pain point is Veeva. Always has been.

And then they try to get you to buy on to their other programs. So during COVID, they tried to get us to buy on to this, and I think Biogen does it. Essentially, you can write an e-mail. You can have an e-mail that blast out to all these physicians talking about having a meeting and we want to show you this deck.

So some Veevas here at Horizon, some Veevas you can show like if you want to show slides, it's within the Veeva system. The previous company Sanofi didn't allow that because we didn't want people tracking what slides we are showing because then if we put a medical information request in that said show the safety and you showed efficacy slides, the compliance could have a field day saying, why did you show efficacy slides, your medical information requests had only safety slides.

So we took away that functionality. So I have taken away from my team. I think my other colleagues are using that piece a little bit here at Horizon. They like to track that. I don't like to track that.

## Tegus Client
Got it. So a lot of Veeva offerings are really built through like the relationship management and the

marketing focus. Going back to the MedView products specifically, does it essentially act the same just for different stakeholders? Or what does the product really look like? And what does it do for you guys?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Exactly the same. It's essentially the same thing with a couple of tweaks that you would not have on the commercial side, but we all use it the same way. So commercial uses their Veeva essentially the same way. They don't input any free format, except insight.

So we have a whole bucket around insights, so competitive intelligence that we put into the system. That's probably a little bit different than our commercial colleagues. I know it's different from them because they're not asked to put all that stuff in there. I don't think they trust the sales reps to put free format in there because you just never know what you're going to get.

## Tegus Client
Got you. So interested to hear a little bit back to what we're talking about before. Just outside of the engagement and management and CRM type tools and vendors, more on the identification and like managing your interactions with the KOLs, how you guys can find the KOLs that make up that 90% that are the folks that you're really targeting post-launch that are outside of your current understanding of the space.

What are the tools that folks do to achieve this? Is it mostly agencies and consultancies? When is it good to engage agencies and consultancies, if at all? Or what other tools are there in the space that you guys use for this?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
So I can tell you that we used a database at Viela, essentially, we used IMS data, and we used a Monocl is the development that we used for KOL management that I told you there was a lot of different stuff within that system that was actually our own employees.

Now Horizon uses Z -- I can't think of this consultants name Z, whatever they are. They actually use them to do all of the mapping for commercial. So actually, our mapping was done differently from my brand was done differently than commercial.

So commercial used this agency to look at their top folks, top 900 physicians, whereas we used a KOL list that I had for Monocl that we had basically digested down. And usually, this is what's good about doing premarket. So if you get into the market 18 months ahead of launch, then you can filter through all of the sites that actually say that they're KOLs.

And we could get into a whole discussion around what is the KOL versus somebody who is an HCP and everything else because everybody determines it very differently. And what does really KOL mean? So we actually filtered through it.

So our original list, we've changed two or three times by the time I got to Horizon a year later from launch, we had already changed our groups of folks a few times. So we go out and see these people, and we find out, well, they're only doing MS. They're not doing any NMOSD or maybe they have one patient. Well, they get thrown off our list.

At least from the medical side, now commercial, they may or may not put them within that group if they have one or two patients. Because we're a rare disease, we have a lot of onesie-twosies. And so you want to go for your highest yield, but in the COVID world, it changed because we went for the folks that were open. The academic centers were all the highest yielding patient groups, while we couldn't get into the academic institutions, medical could talk to them. Commercial actually went for the community folks where medical went for more of the academics folks. So it's kind of an interesting mix of how that was done.

And I think a lot of companies, all the companies within this therapeutic area all did kind of the same thing. So now that we're coming out of COVID, there's still a little bit of access issues with our academic institutions. They're still closed in many instances. So they're still a lot harder to get to.

So maybe on your list, but you may not be able to visit anybody. Perfect example, University of Michigan all neurology shut down to anybody commercial, they will talk to people medical, but they won't talk to anybody commercial.

## Tegus Client
Super interesting. I guess one question I have is it sounds sort of duplicates in some ways, right? Why is sort of the medical affairs team using Monocl identified KOLs and then sort of the commercial team is using ZS or some other agency to do the same prior to COVID, right? So COVID that sort of been a split. But sort of what is the purpose of sort of doing this sort of two-pronged approach? Is there a reason or it's just sort of inefficient?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
So the reason is because medical affairs has to be supposedly unbiased. So they're looking at influence. So they're looking at folks that are the most influential versus the people that have the highest number of scripts. So if we look at Monocl, we're not going to see their script counts whereas commercial is looking at script count.

So this physician is the top position for NMOSD. They had 35 patients, and they wrote this many prescriptions. So commercial doesn't really care that much about it and the influence per se as they do the script counts.

I mean till to this day, every time I have a conversation they say, how many patients does that physician have at their practice? Like I don't know. I don't know that. That's not something that I think about, but I know that, that physician has a lot of influence over 10 other people in the Northeast.

So I'll give a perfect example, in San Francisco, you have a physician who is very well known who's been doing research in B-cell therapies? Well, they were in our trial. They may have two or three patients within the trial. They say they're their patients.

They're probably not their patients or they're the three patients that they see once a month. So they're a high influence, but they're not seeing all the patients. They're underlings, they're seeing all those patients within that institution.

## Tegus Client
Just to reiterate here then, I was going to ask, so what defines the KOL for you really is the things that go into their influence, their share of voice, right? So what are some typical, like what are the markers that you're looking for that makes the KOL a KOL to you and how you rank them?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Sure. So the biggest thing is publications, presentations, the academic institution, are they certified or not within that therapeutic area? So are they MS certified? So those are like the key three things. Do they participate in ad boards?

And then those are probably the big four things that we're most concerned about. So if they're on all the publications, they're going to be very high in the list. But remember, if you're at an academic institution, you have to have so many publications per year like 15 or more.

So of course, they're going to look like they're the most influential because they have to do it, whereas you have somebody in a private practice doesn't have to do that. So they may not have had publications for years or even posters at congresses.

## Tegus Client
Is the recency or the liveness of that sort of data important to you guys? Like you may not know who's publishing the most papers or you may already know who is publishing the most papers, but like who's publishing papers this year versus last year versus the year before? Or who's at this type of site versus an AMP versus community site versus QHP or whatever else. How relevant is that data?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
It is relevant while we're launching. So we're a new brand. So it's really relevant as we're launching right now. It won't be as relevant a few years from now when we're not in that same launch process. So as we're launching this product, we want to make sure that these people are saying, so as they go to the podium, they're saying the right things.

So I always look to make sure that we have the right KOLs, especially if they're going to the podium, they know our data really well because the last thing you want to do is them not talking about your data.

## Tegus Client
Right. And you mentioned IQVIA data earlier. So IQVIA is really big on their claims data, which is prescriptions and volume of prescriptions, how useful is that then to the med affairs teams really if they're really looking for their influence in publications and abstracts and things like that rather than just volume of scripts?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
At the end of the day, we say we're not interested, but everybody will tell you we're very interested because it validates who we're talking to. So it's not like I'm going to take somebody off my list who has a lot of influence.

And some companies won't let you see that data. So we don't typically distill it down past management. Management is the only ones that typically sees that data. We would never let our MSLs or R&D see that information. But I determine a lot of things on a geographic area.

Are there enough patients? So when I actually did an exercise to look for expanding my team, we looked at patient lives in the different areas across the U.S., and that's actually how I determined whether we were going to increase my team size or not.

It was actually based on essentially prescribing data -- because I couldn't really do it on really sphere of influence. I mean, we cross-reference the sphere of influence, but it's really difficult. You may have an area of, let's say, the Northwest that doesn't have a lot of big sphere of influence, but they may have a lot of riders.

## Tegus Client
And I'm just trying to understand the workflow a little bit better. So you're getting the data from IQVIA. And then I guess you're doing a bunch of analytics on it in many cases, to sort of draw insights from it. And then you're sort of seizing it back into the CRM, which sort of lives within Veeva. Is that sort of a correct lay of the land?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So within our CRM, we have every provider in neurology, and then we will identify a core group of people that we're going to have as our core group. So my team dedicates 30 people as their core group. Sanofi looks at 40, typically between 30 and 50 is the standard across all of industry.

And we call them a core list. We call them our top 40 at Sanofi, BMS calls at their top 50. I think they have a top 50. And those are people that, let's say, we had a label change or something we needed the physicians know those are the core group of people that we're going to go back to an alert.

We think those are the most influential within our area that need to know specific information. And they maybe our speakers, they may be on our investigators, I just want to verify their speakers, their investigators and then most of them are that piece and then some may be folks that actually don't even prescribe. So one of ours may be a statistician who is part of our core group because he was part of our trial.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And sort of all this work managing sort of like the top 50, identifying the KOLs and all the relationships and meeting notes and everything, does that all live within sort of the module that you're primarily using within Veeva.

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. We identify that within Veeva so we'll put KOL. It depends on how you define it. There's usually a check box that you can check. There's boxes you can check for investigator, there's boxes you can check for speakers and then you can drill down into those folks, but you'll have that core list that lives with in Veeva. Unfortunately, your notes are not in Veeva. No company I worked for would allow that. So all of your notes are done on your own.

## Tegus Client
When you say notes are done on your own, like what sort of notes are we talking about and where do they live on your own?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So if they were developing a KOL, like I'm going to take this physician who's a community neurologist. And I want to make him a speaker, I want to invite him to an ad board. I want to have some publications. I don't typically denote those in Veeva because I don't know why. We don't typically do that. We don't say what we're working on.

The notes are my own notes that are in my little pad at home, and I flipped to that physician or maybe I've notes on my computer that says, this is what I'm doing with each physician. Now some companies denote maybe a top 10 KOL list that they have a, what we call it a development plan for each of these KOLs.

And they have 10 people they do a development plan for and they're really dropdown boxes. This is what I'm going to work on with this physician and it's drop-down boxes so there's no free format because they don't want free format, that's a compliance nightmare.

## Tegus Client
So the primary reason that the notes, you can't actually track your notes in the platform is because of a compliance issue. That's where both the commercial teams and the med affairs teams, right? That's like a hard and fast, no, you see that changing or some way to circumvent that.

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
No, I don't see any way. I mean you would think you could train a team and they wouldn't put something in there and they do, unfortunately, and that's discoverable at the end of the day. I can't tell how many times my team has had to say to a sales rep, please don't discuss, you want to drive your business and my e-mail or I need you to help me to run my business or get a prescription or whatever it may be.

I mean, even as much as we hounded what you can't say or not say people still do it. And every company is very different in the way they act. So Sanofi had a lot more firewalls from medical to commercial where Horizon is a lot more loose with medical and commercial. They work a lot more together. I mean they still follow certain guidelines, but they're a little bit more loose on how they work together and communicate. It just depends on the company's summer.

## Tegus Client
Really between the lines of sort of what you're saying, and you said the services a few times now, it sounds like that's the communication between commercial and med affairs is broadly a good thing, which is sort of currently lacking. Could you sort of take it a little bit more sort of what the particular pain points that exist in that sort of communication channel today, where if communication were better, it would allow you to sort of do X, Y or Z?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So I think probably the biggest pain point is everybody not knowing their role. So I think that's where there's a lot of failure. And I know a lot of companies have put a new role called, we call it a strategic marketing liaison. There's a thought leader liaison. They're all kind of called the same thing.

That role has been put into a lot of companies, and that it's technically a marketing role, but it works very

Page 12 of 15

differently at different companies. It's still at the end of the day, part of commercial. And so that's where a lot of the communication issues go.

So your sales reps going into the site or the physician's office and talking about the drug. Then you've got this thought leader liaison that comes in and maybe they're working with speakers and making sure they're understanding, but they may be kind of like a pseudo sales rep, and then you get your med affairs colleagues that are also coming in there.

And then you have other groups. So then you have infusion site managers, you may have reimbursement specialists, all these physicians, they may have four or five or six people from each company coming to their offices. From our standpoint, we can't put stuff really in e-mail.

At the end of the day, as long as they don't tell us how to do our job, we can communicate as much as possible, but you just have to watch how you work together. We can't go to meetings together.

There are some loosening, I think, that are happening, where we could as long as it's on label. If it goes off label, then the thought leader liaison would leave the room. Now the sales rep and the MSL would never be in the room unless there was an introduction, and that's across the industry. No other way.

## Tegus Client
What do you mean by an introduction there really quickly?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So an introduction is basically just, hey, Dr. Smith, this is John Doe, and I want to make sure you guys meet and then they leave. Then it's done. So that's the only thing they can do with the sales rep between medical and that sales rep across the industry.

Now if a company is doing that, they're probably not doing like 95% are doing. Now some people will use their sales reps to help coordinate meetings for them. I see that happen a little bit. I think that's a gray area where you have your sales rep helping to kind of coordinate.

It's gray because really, the MSL needs, they should have these relationships on their own. But maybe if it's a newer physician that maybe doesn't need as much scientific or they don't really want to have a discussion much with their MSL. Maybe they're a busy office. So it takes a lot more to get into those offices.

## Tegus Client
Got it. You mentioned that in the case of Veeva, a lot of the implementation of the program and the use of it through the entire product life cycle. Have you had any experience with choosing vendors like either Veeva or Monocl at Definitive or IQVIA or any other vendors and what that process looks like? How do you select one, how you bring them on the platform, how you decide to use them and how you manage them?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So it's pretty similar across all companies that I've been through. It's all who you know first. Typically, they say, "Hey, we want a vendor for this. Okay, who knows vendors that IQVIA-type vendors. And that's what happens is everybody comes in and does their presentation.

And then we look to make sure that we have contracts in place for each one of them. Sanofi was a lot more strict. They had vetted it pre, pre. So you can only look at like two vendors, but Horizon is a lot more open. So they look at everybody and they look at all the vendors, and we can bring anybody on that we want.

But typically, we'll have a team of folks that will evaluate and really just look at from a cost perspective and what they're giving us, what makes the most sense to our team. And typically, we do this together commercial and medical together for a lot of the vendors that we use.

We actually use a lot of the same vendors. So like we use Lockwood for our medical and our marketing departments and they run our ad boards because we didn't like our vendor, ended up liking the commercial vendor as much, but it's tied in real well because they're helping out with ad boards so the marketing team

Page 13 of 15

does ad boards, they cross-reference our list.

So there's really a lot of good things if you use the same vendor for different aspects because then they can cross reference. But really, I think we're starting to use IQVIA and we won't be using it from the medical side because we don't have any money to fund it, but the marketing team is starting to use it for their KOL identification.

So they have a whole KOL identification process again. We go through this constantly. And then I forget what their ZS & Associates, that's what it is. They always come in and do a whole analysis and they've been typically used across the industry.

And they tell you to add people and then they come in a year later and tell you to lose people. This is typical of ZS Associates and charge of a lot of money. It's all a running joke because we use a lot of vendors at Horizon. So we all make jokes about all of our different vendors, but some are really good.

## Tegus Client
How have you seen the differences between these different types of vendors, like ZS is a consultancy, IQVIA is a massive CRO with a ton of data, and then you have some of these other players like Monocl at Definitive, a bit more heavy on the data and the analytics side? From your experience at med affairs, what do you see the most value from all of these given that you do these due diligences together?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. I think really what it is, its ease of use in being able to get the data really easily. So our teams are extremely busy. So we want vendors that are going to help us get this data very easily and we don't want something that's a constant add-on, where a lot of programs like okay.

But if you want that functionality, you're going to add another 30,000 to that. And that's the problem. So we had IQVIA actually tried to build their own system. And the same thing, it's like, well, for 50,000, we can add medical affairs and another 100,000 we can add this one. And I'm like, no, we're out. We don't need that. We don't need all those resources.

We've already done it. We already know who players are where Monocl is very cheap. So at the end of the day, Monocl, you can get a license for $20,000 and you get two users and you're doing it on your own. If your analytics is good at doing this or yourself, you're good at doing this, it's an amazing offer.

## Tegus Client
Is it preference here then to get these vendors that let you kind of use the sandbox environment that's got everything going on where you can sort of build your own solution and find your own insights or is it to use things that are a little more out of the box and from the larger incumbents? And also the second part of that, how does that differ between Sanofi versus Viela versus Horizon? Is there a difference that's relevant to choosing these different vendors versus bigger or small pharmas?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So big pharmas typically using your big box outfits, they're not using a lot of small just because they've been vetted from Sanofi's is based in Boston. So a lot of those folks even vetted maybe internationally as well. Whereas Viela, it was essentially who you knew and who you got the best deal from because we're a little small biotech.

So and all this stuff was very cheap. It was out-of-the-box Monocl-type stuff where we had to do it on our own. Horizon is kind of in between the two of them. So it looks just like small pharma to big pharma.

We use some of the big box stuff, but we won't pay the prices that the Sanofis of the world would pay. We may use IQVIA, but we won't get all the information that we really, really need. We wouldn't drill down as much as Sanofi would have drilled down because of the costs.

And then how does that differ between the med affair folks and the commercial folks. I know you mentioned med affairs, the budgets are obviously different between the teams, but how big is that difference really? And is commercial getting much more of these vendors, much more interest in the vendors? Or is it more similar?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
No, they use a lot more vendors than we do. So med affairs usually uses one vendor as much as they can just because they don't have the budgets that commercial has. So commercial is getting so many more vendors. I mean, I would tell you that our marketing team probably have seven vendors they are using, we use two and Horizon and each company is different.

So Sanofi didn't use a lot of vendors for as much as Horizon uses, we have probably 20 vendors that we use. Every time I turn around, there's a new vendor, I've got to give a report to or give data to. It depends on the company. Horizon is midsize. So they're kind of in this growth phase, they grew really fast, and they don't have the manpower to deal with all this.

Where Sanofi, they have a job dedicated just to that, and then Viela, you're doing it on your own. You're having one vendor put everything together as much as you can possibly do, or you're doing it yourself. I mean small biotech, you don't have the money.

## Tegus Client
Makes total sense. Why typically shipping out a lot of stuff to ZS Associates? Is it a bandwidth thing? Is it something that they can do that you guys can't do internally? Sort of what's the path for all the outsourced consulting?

## National Director, Field Medical Affairs at Horizon Pharmaceutical
Yes. So the lady actually who's part of that development, she actually came from ZS. I don't know why we used ZS because we can do the same thing internally. I feel like they want to use a vendor to blame it on the vendor. That's what I feel like it is at every company. Sanofi was the same way. We came to the same conclusions, but we use ZS kind of offload it to them, kind of blame them for increase or decrease of size.
