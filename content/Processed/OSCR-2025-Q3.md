Q: Regarding the September weekly report, is there any indication of how much market morbidity shifts might have been from factors like FTRV checks and removal of duplicated members heading into the fourth quarter?A: The report showed market morbidity increases by about 1.5 to 2 points across several markets. It captures claims through July and doesn't include impacts from FTR or dual enrollment churn in the third quarter. About 45% of people on CMS's list for FTR or dual enrollments have churned, and they have higher risk than the average book, which could be a tailwind to market morbidity. We expect market morbidity to remain consistent through the end of the year. (Unidentified_5)

Q: With G&A being a bright spot, do you still feel confident in achieving your longer-term G&A target of 16% by 2027, even with expected member attrition?A: We believe there is more room in our SG&A as we move forward. We are leveraging AI to streamline operating costs and ensure our variable costs align with the size of our business. We are confident in adapting our cost structure to market changes. (Unidentified_3)

Q: Can you elaborate on the underlying cost trends in the quarter and any changes from the first half? What areas drove favorable development?A: The favorable prior period development (PPD) was $84 million, with about half related to risk adjustment and favorable development around rebate estimates. Utilization continues to moderate year over year, with inpatient remaining elevated but moderating, and outpatient and professional slightly elevated. We are focused on driving appropriate site-of-care transitions. (Unidentified_5)

Q: If enhanced subsidies are extended, what mechanisms would help create a more stable re-enrollment process for consumers in 2026?A: We have designed $0 gold and bronze plans and educated brokers on product types. If enhanced tax credits are extended, there may not be a meaningful way to change prices. A minimum MLR in the ACA market could require rebates if plans make too much money, which would be positive for members. (Unidentified_3)

Q: How does Oscar's morbidity in 2026 compare to the market, and what strategies give you more control over morbidity relative to the market?A: We have priced as if premium tax credits are gone and accounted for 2025 morbidity impacts and potential 2026 impacts. We believe we are well covered for whatever happens next year relative to market morbidity. Our pricing captures the risk, and we are well-positioned to navigate the marketplace.
