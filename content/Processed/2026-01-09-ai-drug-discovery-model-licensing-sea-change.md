# AI Model Licensing is Killing Biobucks—But Clinical Trials Still Gate Everything

**The take:** Pharma is shifting from paying $5B in milestone-laden "biobucks" for drug assets to paying $50M+ upfront for AI model access. This is a fundamental business model inversion: AI companies now capture software multiples (10-15x revenue) instead of biotech multiples (3-5x). But the dirty secret? No AI-discovered drug has been approved anywhere. The bottleneck hasn't moved—it's just gotten faster at filling the clinical trial queue with candidates that still fail at historic rates in Phase II.

**Investment implication:** Fund AI drug discovery companies structured as software businesses (ARR, model licensing, SaaS), not as asset-heavy biotechs. But don't overpay—clinical trial risk hasn't gone away, it's just been pushed downstream.

## 1. The Deal Structure Sea Change

### Old Model: Biobucks
Traditional pharma-biotech deals paid massive backend milestones tied to drug development:
- **Sanofi-Exscientia (2022):** $100M upfront + **$5.2B biobucks** for 15 small molecules
- **Novartis-Generate (2024):** $1B+ total, milestone-heavy
- **Lilly-Insilico (2024):** $100M+ in upfront + milestones + royalties

Structure: Small upfront, huge backend. AI company only gets paid if drugs succeed in trials.

### New Model: Model Licensing
The January 2026 deals mark a paradigm shift:

| Deal | Structure | Key Difference |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **GSK-Noetik** | $50M upfront + 5-year subscription + data collaboration | Paying for *models*, not drugs. Non-exclusive license. |
| **Chai-Lilly** | Purpose-built exclusive model + platform deployment | Lilly deploys Chai's platform internally. |
| **Boltz-Pfizer** | Model refinement on Pfizer data + custom workflows | Boltz trains exclusive models *for* Pfizer. |

**Noetik's CEO called this "a new paradigm in biotech: the licensing of human foundation models."** GSK isn't buying drug candidates—they're buying computational tools.

### The Valuation Arbitrage
Same $50M ARR achieves different valuations:
- Biotech multiple (3-5x): **$150-250M**
- SaaS multiple (10-15x): **$500-750M**

Chai Discovery raised at **$1.3B valuation** on $225M total funding. That's software economics, not biotech economics.

## 2. How This Changes the Funding Equation

### Capital Efficiency Improves Dramatically

**Old biotech:** Needed $500M+ and 10 years to reach clinical validation. High burn, binary outcomes.

**AI model companies:**
- Boltz: $28M seed, 100K+ scientists using models within months
- Chai: $30M seed → $70M A → $130M B in 12 months
- Noetik: $40M Series A, already signing $50M pharma deals

**Key insight:** Open-source models (Boltz-1, Chai-1) generate distribution and validation *before* monetization. Pharma pays for exclusive fine-tuning, not base model access.

### Revenue Predictability
Model licensing creates recurring revenue:
- GSK-Noetik: 5-year agreement with annual fees
- Lilly TuneLab: Federated learning platform with ongoing data exchange
- Subscription pricing emerging ($4,500/GPU/year for Nvidia's platform)

This is *software* revenue recognition, not milestone-gated biotech revenue.

### Implication for Investors
- **Lower capital requirements** to reach meaningful pharma partnerships
- **Higher valuations** on same revenue due to SaaS multiples
- **Reduced binary risk** vs. traditional biotech (not dependent on single drug success)
- **BUT:** Still dependent on pharma R&D budgets and willingness to pay for tools

## 3. US-China Competitive Dynamics

### China is Winning on Deal Volume
- **Q1 2025:** Chinese companies captured **32% of global biotech licensing deal value** (up from 21% in 2023-24)
- **XtalPi-DoveTree:** $51M upfront + up to **$5.99B** in milestones
- **AstraZeneca-CSPC:** **$5B** for AI platform + preclinical cancer drugs
- **Sanofi-Helixon:** **$1.72B** partnership

### Structural Advantages: China
1. **Data access:** National health insurance covers 600M+ people—massive training datasets
2. **Cost arbitrage:** Trials 30-50% cheaper, 2-3x faster enrollment
3. **Policy support:** AI drug discovery in Five-Year Plan, provincial funding unlocked
4. **Talent:** 30,000 active AI researchers + cheaper chemistry/biology workforce

### Structural Advantages: US
1. **Capital:** $5.6B in AI drug discovery VC (2024)
2. **Regulatory gold standard:** FDA approval still required for global markets
3. **Foundation model leadership:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google backing US AI biotechs
4. **IP protection:** Stronger patent enforcement

### The Risk
**US policy headwinds:** Proposed NIH/NSF budget cuts + tighter visa policies could accelerate brain drain. China already matches US+UK+EU combined in AI research publication output.

**China's weakness:** No AI-discovered drug approved anywhere yet. Regulatory pathways for AI-designed molecules still unclear globally.

## 4. The Clinical Trial Bottleneck Reality Check

### The Hype
AI drug discovery companies claim:
- **18 months** from target to preclinical candidate (vs. 4-6 years traditional)
- **80-90% Phase I success** (vs. 40-65% industry average)
- **70% cost reduction** through better compound selection

### The Reality
**Zero AI-discovered drugs have been approved.** The furthest along:
- Insilico's INS018_055: Phase II (started June 2023)
- Exscientia's DSP-1181: Phase I complete, status unclear

### Where Value Actually Accrues

| Stage | AI Impact | Bottleneck Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Target ID | High (multi-omics analysis) | Mostly solved |
| Structure prediction | Commoditized (AF3, Boltz, Chai all equivalent) | Solved |
| Compound screening | High (trillion-scale virtual screening) | Largely solved |
| Lead optimization | Moderate (DMTA cycle still manual) | **Active bottleneck** |
| Preclinical tox | Emerging (predictive models) | Still slow |
| Phase I | Faster enrollment possible | Moderate improvement |
| **Phase II** | **Minimal impact—28.9% success rate unchanged** | **THE bottleneck** |
| Phase III | Faster enrollment, better stratification | Moderate improvement |

### The Shifting Bottleneck Problem
As AI floods the pipeline with candidates:
1. **Chemistry/CMC** becomes constrained (synthesis capacity)
2. **Preclinical tox** studies back up
3. **Clinical trial slots** become competitive
4. **Phase II failures** accelerate—faster to fail, not faster to succeed

**Key quote:** "AI accelerates the drug discovery pipeline, reducing the traditional 10–15 year process to as little as 1–2 years." But that's discovery, not development. Trials still take 6-10 years.

## 5. Investment Implications

### Bull Case
1. **Model licensing captures software economics** → Higher valuations, lower risk
2. **Pharma WTP proven** → $50M+ deals happening now
3. **Data moats compound** → First movers with proprietary training data win
4. **China competition** → Creates urgency for US pharma to partner faster

### Bear Case
1. **No clinical validation** → Still zero approvals, hype could collapse
2. **Commoditization risk** → Open-source models (Boltz, Chai) erode pricing power
3. **Phase II wall** → Faster discovery doesn't fix 28.9% efficacy success rate
4. **Pharma budget shifts** → If AI tools don't improve outcomes, spending will revert

### Where to Focus
**Fund:** Companies with proprietary *data* moats (clinical outcomes, patient data, wet lab phenomics)
**Avoid:** Pure algorithm plays without data differentiation
**Watch:** First AI-discovered drug to reach Phase III—will be the real validation event

### Specific Opportunities
- **Model licensing plays:** Noetik, Chai, Boltz structure
- **Data moats:** Recursion (65PB phenomics), Tempus ($1B+ platform), Datavant (100B patient records)
- **China exposure:** XtalPi partnerships, CSPC platform deals

## Contradictions & Uncertainties

1. **Valuation disconnect:** Chai at $1.3B on no approved drugs. Is this software valuation justified without clinical proof?

2. **Open-source paradox:** Boltz and Chai released models open-source, then monetize enterprise versions. Will this commoditize the base technology?

3. **Phase II wall:** If AI doesn't improve Phase II success rates, the whole thesis collapses. No evidence yet either way.

4. **China data risk:** Chinese companies have structural data advantages, but can Western pharma actually access/trust that data?

---

## Recommendations

1. **Thesis update:** Add "Model Licensing Economics" as explicit investment thesis—the biobucks-to-SaaS shift is real and investable.

2. **Diligence focus:** For any AI drug discovery investment, demand clarity on: (a) data moat, (b) revenue structure (SaaS vs. milestones), (c) Phase II pipeline visibility.

3. **Watch signal:** First AI-discovered drug reaching Phase III approval will be the defining validation event. Track Insilico INS018_055 closely.

4. **China monitoring:** Track XtalPi, CSPC, and Helixon deal flow. If China captures >40% of global licensing value, US competitiveness thesis needs revision.
