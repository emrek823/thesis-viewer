## Abstract
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the issuance of a priority review voucher to the sponsor of a rare pediatric disease product application. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) authorizes FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of approved rare pediatric disease product applications that meet certain criteria. FDA is required to publish notice of the award of the priority review voucher. FDA has determined that KYGEVVI (doxecitine and doxribtimine), approved November 3, 2025, manufactured by UCB, Inc., meets the criteria for a priority review voucher.
