About

NOHARM is a physician-validated medical benchmark to evaluate the accuracy and safety of AI-generated medical recommendations, grounded in real medical cases. The current version covers 10 specialties across 100 cases, and includes 12,747 specialist annotations on beneficial and harmful medical actions that can be taken in the 100 cases. This project is led and supported by the ARISE AI Research Network, based at Stanford and Harvard.

Motivation

As physicians, one of our core principles is to do no harm. With the rapid integration of AI technologies into medicine, how can we evaluate the harm of technologies? How do we evaluate how these models perform, compared to each other, and importantly, to ourselves?
