## Slide 3: Evvy's existing, proprietary product set will be able to detect and improve many of the major conditions in women's health.
Evvy's existing, proprietary product set will be able to detect and improve many of the major conditions in women's health.

**VMB Test**
Metagenomics on VMB + metadata

Our existing VMB test will be able to algorithmically identify:

*   Vaginitis (TODAY)
*   PCOS / Endo / PID (2024)
*   Menopause (2024)
*   Gyn cancers (2025)

Research has shown that all of these conditions have potential markers present in the VMB. We have the largest datasets on each of these groups and already have initial signal across all of them in our dataset today.

As we expand our diagnostic capabilities, we can sell our same VMB test to broader patient & clinic populations.

**VMB Care**
Precision healthcare to optimize VMB

Our existing vaginal healthcare platform will be able to improve outcomes for:

*   **Vaginitis (TODAY)**
    *   Unoptimized VMB = vaginitis (most common reason women go to the doctor)
*   **IVF Failure (2024)**
    *   Unoptimized VMB has 4x higher rates of failure (source)
*   **Preterm Birth (2024/2025)**
    *   Unoptimized VMB is responsible for up to 40% of PTB (source)
*   **Cervical cancer prog (2025/2026)**
    *   Unoptimized VMB is associated with higher rates of progression (source)

## Slide 5: Phase 2: Unlocking higher LTV / CAC on clinical vaginitis test & care ($17B revenue business)
Phase 2: Unlocking higher LTV / CAC on clinical vaginitis test & care ($17B revenue business)

Clear path to get to 12 mo LTV/CAC of 2.5 in 2023

1.  ✓ Launching care business (rebuilding clinical test, designing new care pathways, running study to validate them) •••
2.  Launching expanded test panels (STIs & AMR) with higher margin (July 2023) ••
3.  Distribution through providers already treating vaginitis (PCPs, OBGYNs, digital health companies, naturopaths, health coaches, etc.) to reduce CAC (Q2/Q3 2023) •
4.  Increasing standard test price (Q3/Q4 2023) •
5.  Getting more test customers into care (increasing LTV, retention, & customer satisfaction) (ongoing) •
    a. There are 2 main levers to achieve this:
        i. Expanding eligibility:
            1.  Continuing to identify disease states, design care pathways, and deploy them
            2.  Monitoring stability and designing maintenance programs to ensure sustained shifts in the vaginal microbiome
        ii. Driving conversion:
            1.  We are running constant experiments to optimize this (already gone from 18 → 24% CVR)

## Slide 6: Phase 3: Leveraging Evvy test & care to improve broader health outcomes ($3B revenue business) — starting with IVF
Phase 3: Leveraging Evvy test & care to improve broader health outcomes ($3B revenue business) — starting with IVF

1.  Build, validate, and launch clinical test •••
2.  ✓ Annotate with proprietary reference database for high fidelity insights into dysbiosis / IVF (SAGE / MAGs) •••
3.  ✓ Design, study, and launch clinically proven care pathways •••
4.  Identify first clinic partner (Q3 2023) •
    *   We have strong relationships in this space (e.g. CEO of the largest fertility clinic network in the US, KindBody, etc.), and clinics are interested in offerings that differentiate them / improve their success rates
5.  Run study with clinic partner showing our test & care improves clinical pregnancy rates (Q4 2023 - Q2 2024) ••
    *   How we've de-risked this:
        *   We already ran a clinical study showing our test/care platform improves the vaginal microbiome (and we are validating / optimizing our platform every day through our DTC vaginitis business)
        *   3rd party studies already show that improvements in the vaginal microbiome lead to improved IVF outcomes
        *   we are just connecting the dots between these two studies with the only validated test & care platform in the US
6.  Distribution (2024) •
    *   This can be DTC & through fertility clinics. Consumers are desperate for anything that can increase their chances of pregnancy, and fertility clinics are desperate for solutions that differentiate them and increase their success rates.
    *   This is also where we believe we can get coverage, and we've already talked to payors like Gaia and Sunfish that are interested in partnership (they are optimizing for 1-2% improvements, and VMB has opportunity to 4x chances of success)
    *   10% of IVF market = $23M annual revenue
7.  Repeatable playbook for pregnancy (10% of market = $180M annual revenue) & abnormal pap smears (10% of market = $7M annual revenue), which we can launch workstreams against in 2024

## Slide 7: Phase 3: Biomarker licensing: leveraging Evvy's data for improved diagnostics ($12B business)
Phase 3: Biomarker licensing: leveraging Evvy's data for improved diagnostics ($12B business)

1.  Data collection on cohorts of interest with comprehensive test •••
2.  ✓ Annotate with proprietary reference database for high fidelity insights into disease states (SAGE / MAG pipeline) •••
3.  Biomarker discovery / signature identification for specific disease states (e.g. vaginitis, PCOS, endo, PID, etc.) ••
    *   How we've de-risked this:
        *   Research already shows these associations exist, and we have >1k patients in many of the relevant cohorts (>10x previously studied datasets in most cases)
        *   SAGE — we see the highest fidelity of genetic differences between health / disease for our patients
        *   We have the playbook for this from Viome and world class team members to do it (who have done it before)
        *   We have LabCorp working on this alongside us
4.  Distribution •
    *   Data licensing with LabCorp (already on our cap table and interested in doing this) and other potential partners (Quest, Hologic, etc.)
        *   Just licensing vaginitis markers to LabCorp with a 5% royalty is $22.5M annual revenue
5.  Repeatable playbook for PCOS, endo, PID, CIN, menopause, and other conditions with markers in the VMB ($40M+ in annual revenue)
    *   Distribution can include biomarker licensing (like with LabCorp above) but also:
        *   DTC screening (we already have an interested population to sell into)
        *   FDA approved diagnostic for high value applications in areas like gyn cancer (following the path of Viome's cancer detect that received FDA breakthrough designation)

Phase 3: Capturing value across $110B+ in healthcare costs ($16.5B business)

The vaginal microbiome is the front door to women's health. Evvy will capture value across all of the below disease states that have a relation to the vaginal microbiome (through our test & care platform, potential new diagnostics, and future OTC/therapeutics). $110B+ of associated healthcare costs, all of which are underserved areas of active pain / people are searching for solutions.

*   $4.90 IVF
*   $25.0 Menopause
*   $26.0 Preterm birth
*   $22.00 Endometriosis
*   $4.36 PCOS
*   $1.60 Cervical cancer
*   $5.80 Ovarian Cancer
*   $4.80 Bacterial vaginosis
*   $1.90 PID
*   $4.00 STDs

## Slide 9: Phase 4: 51% (at least) of the US population goes through Evvy annually ($33B business)
Phase 4: 51% (at least) of the US population goes through Evvy annually ($33B business)

We will be the data layer powering proactive healthcare for women.

*   Once we have expanded into the many states of disease/pain in the female body related to the vaginal microbiome, we will continue to expand into preventative care.
*   We imagine a world where all women go through Evvy as part of their annual "well woman" visits. With one swab, we will be able to identify risk for a variety of conditions and provide recommendations for treatments, OTC supplements, lifestyle changes and more that mitigate the risk of a host of negative conditions in the female body.
*   We will be able to plug into a variety of players in the healthcare system to deliver these insights — ingesting clinical EHR data, other test results, in addition to our own suite of tests (proprietary and commodified) — enabling us to provide a precise understanding of a woman's health, and what's most likely to improve it.

AND YET...

BV is still defined as just an “overgrowth of bacteria.”

Even though this condition is incredibly prevalent, frustrating, and expensive, our clinical definition hasn't changed since sequencing could actually uncover the composition of the microbiome.

Unsurprisingly, there's more to the picture.

Leveraging new technologies, researchers have started to paint a picture of how much more complex "BV” actually is — and how critical holistic, precise, and preventative care is for vaginal health.

| Microbe               | Percentage |
| :-------------------- | :--------- |
| Lactobacillus crispatus | 41.12%     |
| Prevotella bivia      | 10.34%     |
| Corynebacterium       | 9.11%      |
| Gardnerella vaginalis  | 8.73%      |

**WHAT TO KNOW**
*   Research has shown that Gardnerella vaginalis may be associated with bacterial vaginosis. G. vaginalis can catalyze an inflammatory immune response and damage vaginal cells.
*   It can also develop biofilm (a sticky, strong layer of infection cells) leading to difficult-to-treat bacterial vaginosis. The biofilm created by G. vaginalis may help other disruptive bacteria grow such as Atopobium.
*   Symptoms of the presence of this bacteria include abnormal discharge such as grey color or watery texture.

## Slide 28: The vaginal microbiome is also an overlooked opportunity for preventative female healthcare.
The vaginal microbiome is also an overlooked opportunity for preventative female healthcare.

Protective microbes in the vagina keep the pH low and make it difficult for pathogens to thrive. When this barrier breaks down, the reproductive system is compromised — increasing the risk of adverse health outcomes.

Groundbreaking research has highlighted the opportunity for testing and modulation of the vaginal microbiome to improve outcomes and reduce costs across conditions such as:

| Condition              | Associated Cost |
| :--------------------- | :-------------- |
| **Vaginal Infections** | $7B             |
| **IVF Failure¹**       | $5B             |
| **Preterm Birth²**     | $26B            |
| **Gynecologic Cancer³** | $4B             |
| **STI Acquisition⁴**   | $4B             |

**Footnotes:**
1.  High levels of Lactobacillus are associated with higher rates of IVF success.
2.  A higher diversity VM in the first trimester and lower overall levels of lactobacilli are associated with preterm birth.
3.  There is a strong link between low diversity in the VM, increased HPV persistence, and development of cervical cancer.

**Testimonial from DR. CRAIG COHEN OB-GYN + PROFESSOR, UCSF:**
"As an OBGYN, I've seen how common and debilitating vaginal infections can be for women around the world.
As a leading researcher of the vaginal microbiome, my colleagues and I have started to uncover its role in areas beyond vaginal health — including public health challenges like STIs and HIV acquisition, infertility, preterm birth, and more.
I truly believe that Evvy's unique platform combined with the development of new therapeutics will catalyze a new era in women's health."

## Slide 39: Vaginitis (17B market) Flowchart and Insights
**Flowchart:**
Vaginitis (17B market) → Infection / inflammation in reproductive tract →
*   IVF failure
*   PTB
*   ETC

**Insights:**
*   Fixing BV from a symptoms / frequency alone is a massive business
*   But fixing BV also improves outcomes in the setting of IVF, pregnancy, etc.
*   Problem was that no one could correctly characterize the VMB or optimize it – which we can now do

## Slide 40: Product & Strategy Expansion Flowchart (Old)
**Flowchart:**

*   **Middle Left:** VMB test + metadata (2021/2022)x
*   **Middle Center:** Personalized Care for vaginitis (2023)
*   **Right Outcomes (from Personalized Care for vaginitis):**
    *   Detect & reduce risk through vaginitis
    *   IVF failure (2023/2024)
    *   Preterm Birth (2024/2025)
    *   Cervical cancer prog (2025/2026)
*   **Bottom Outcomes (from VMB test + metadata):**
    *   Vaginitis (2023/2024)
    *   PCOS / Endo / PID (2024)

## Slide 43: Vaginal Microbiome Test & Care Overview (Old)
**Vaginal Microbiome Test**
Metagenomics on VMB + metadata

Our existing vaginal microbiome test will be able to algorithmically diagnose:
*   Vaginitis (TODAY)
*   PCOS / Endo / PID (2024)
*   Menopause (2024)
*   Gyn cancers (2025)

All of which have markers present in the VMB. As we expand indications, we can sell our same test to broader patient & clinic populations.

**Vaginal Microbiome Care**
Precision Care to optimize VMB

Our existing vaginal microbiome care platform will be able to improve outcomes for*:
*   **Vaginitis (TODAY)**
    *   Unoptimized VMB = vaginitis (most common reason women go to the doctor)
*   **IVF Failure**
    *   Unoptimized VMB has 4x higher rates of failure (SOURCE)
*   **Preterm Birth (2024/2025)**
    *   Unoptimized VMB is responsible for up to 40% of PTB (SOURCE)
*   **Cervical cancer prog (2025/2026)**
    *   BV significantly associated to increased CIN development risk
