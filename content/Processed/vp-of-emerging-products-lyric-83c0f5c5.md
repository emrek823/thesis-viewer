# HealthEdge - Vice President of Emerging Products at Lyric
## Interview conducted on March 13, 2025

### Topics
Cloud Migration, Legacy Systems, System Integration, ROI, Medicaid, Operating Costs, Payment Integrity, Cloud Benefits

### Summary
The conversation between the Tegus Client and the expert centered on the challenges and benefits of migrating legacy installations to cloud-based systems in the healthcare industry. They discussed the importance of long-term commitment, the potential reluctance of larger payers to switch to cloud solutions, and the future possibility of major players making the transition. Additionally, they compared HealthEdge and TriZetto's cloud versions, explored modules within HealthEdge, and discussed the significance of primary claim editing in standardizing coding. The conversation also touched on the capabilities and challenges of various products in the industry, emphasizing the importance of content, technology, and resources in developing effective solutions. The expert highlighted the differences between providers in terms of claims adjudication and data quality, emphasizing the impact of system integration and data update cycles.

### Expert Details
Vice President of Emerging Products at Lyric. The expert is responsible for overseeing product strategy and development, market surveillance, and emerging product/concept design, etc.

Prior to Lyric, the expert was the VP of Partnerships, Mergers, and Acquisitions at Optum. The expert was responsible for software-related inorganic growth activities, etc.

Prior to Optum, the expert was the Sr. Director of Enterprise Strategy and Communications in Anthem Digital/Claim Accuracy Products at Anthem, Inc., responsible for leading the sourcing for claim processing and payment accuracy, product development and strategy, running massive RFP's, as well as overseeing product roadmaps, negotiating strategic partnerships with external parties to move payment accuracy forward across the US.

### Client
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about legacy installations, whether it be homegrown systems or Facets, would or would not get ripped out by large and medium-sized payers. Just remind me where you land out on that.

### Expert
I think where I landed was the big ones, probably unlikely in this climate, be it top two, top three, the middle ones, from my current role in my seat, I can see there is a willingness to make some moves on similarly complex systems. To that effect I think it can be done, but it's going to be hard. I still think the cost to move in this climate are insanely high.

The costs are high no matter who, whether you pick HealthEdge, whether you pick Facets or a TriZetto, an alternative product. They're high, but they can be overcome. It requires a long-term commitment to make a move. As I took some time to think on this from when we talked last, let's just use Molina as an example that has Medicaid across multiple states.

It's approximately 6 million lives. The odds of getting all 6 million lives of Molina in a two-year period, probably low. The odds of being able to get a million lives of it as a slightly better than a POC and a phased implementation, probably looking good right now. There are 6 million total lives, but of that I forget what the exact spread is. I think it's like four million Medicaid, two million commercial. They operate in a bunch of different markets. Can you go get all of Molina in one shot? Probably not. Can you go get Molina's Missouri Medicaid business as a beachhead? Yeah, you can probably do that.

### Client
Interesting. In that example, is the Missouri Medicaid system sufficiently distinct from the rest of the CAPS like adjudication engine that it would be easier to rip and replace that out without disturbing everything else that's going on?

### Expert
Yes. If you have TriZetto, for instance, you may have multiple instances of the same system. Generally speaking, individual markets are reasonably contained. You can peel out and you can stand up a single market without much headache. Medicaid is a lot easier to do because Medicaid, you don't have anybody crossing state lines. If you get down in the Southeastern Indiana side, you've got people that'll go across the border into Ohio to seek care. Ripping Indiana out then gets hard because you have to contemplate Ohio at the same time.

### Client
If you think about in that example, let's say it's a line of Medicaid Missouri, one million lives or if it's a smaller plan with only three million lives total. Let's say they're running Facets, some legacy instance of Facets and they want to modernize that. Would Cognizant have an advantage in how easy it would be to upgrade them to a cloud version of Facets versus a HealthEdge or someone else?

### Expert
I'm going to give you my favorite answer of it depends. It depends on how current you are. The current on-prem version of Facets can be on-prem or in the cloud. An older version does not contemplate going to the cloud. If you're on an old version, you may have to go through an upgrade. I forget the version numbering at Facets, but I'll use Lyric numbering for our claim editor.

If you're a five.X to get to cloud, you have to be at least 7.1, but there's no direct upgrade path from five.X-7.1. You have to go five.X to 6.0 to 6.6 to 7.0 to 7.1, or you have to tear everything out and start over. Those are the options. If you're already current, they can probably defend the space well. I'd also argue if you're current, you're probably happy with your claim system, and therefore that's why you're doing upgrades regularly.

### Client
Got it. You're saying if it's a more recent version of even if it's an on-prem of legacy install, if it's a more, for lack of a better term, up-to-date instance, that's easier to migrate into cloud?

### Expert
Yes.

### Client
Interesting. I would have thought that whatever the cloud native version of X, Y, Z CAPS system would be just a completely different platform as opposed to just taking what's on-prem and migrating it to a host private cloud, is that what you're describing?

### Expert
It's what the technology is based on. The larger players in the space have understood that they're prepping to go to cloud because operating costs go down. Typically security is a little easier. There's a whole bunch of things that are highly beneficial to being in the cloud for talking to industry experts and whatnot. You have to get rid of things like Windows Server and stuff like that on the back end.

I know Cognizant has done this. Lyric's doing it in a separate product, but I'm drawing an analog here of recognizing these are things that have to happen. Let me get your on-prem off of Oracle licenses and old versions of Windows Server and things like that and get them onto things that can then migrate.

### Client
You're saying if the version of Facets is relatively recent, that's most likely not a jump ball for someone else?

### Expert
Right. It's most likely not a jump ball on the core system, but depending on what you have hanging off of it, what other integrations you have, that may be a problem.

### Client
Can you expand on that?

### Expert
Speaking of the space that I live in every day, if you take HealthEdge and jump ball, go from Facets to HealthEdge and you go to the cloud, but your claim editor is still an on-prem install, you now have to manage that everything didn't go to the cloud, only some of the systems went.

If your eligibility or credentialing or network files don't go to the cloud at the same time, you're still creating complexity. That's where, in all honesty, I think HealthEdge has an advantage on anyone that's willing to say, "We're moving cloud." All their applications are designed to connect that way.

### Client
Basically, if you're moving to the cloud, it's better to move everything.

### Expert
Right. Otherwise, what did you really fix? You still have latency issues, you still have on-site maintenance, you've data costs.

### Client
Interesting. Aren't these all part of the CAPS system but I guess not. Some of them are part of provider data management, claims editor, maybe that's part of payment integrity. You're saying all these adjacent.

### Expert
Exactly.

### Client
You're saying it's an all-or-nothing move. It's not obvious that there's an inherent advantage with your legacy CAPS vendor.

### Expert
That's my argument right there, especially if your legacy CAPS vendor hasn't innovated in the outside spaces like HealthEdge. I'm a fan of HealthEdge product as a whole. They've done a good job standing up systems that talk to one another and make it easy that "Hey, if I'm HealthEdge for this, but I'm using somebody else for provider data management," if I want to move my provider data management, I know it's going to work when I move it. I've got to migrate the data but I know the integrations are going to work. They're positioned well once they get the ball rolling. It's just trying to get that first ball rolling is hard.

### Client
Interesting. You mentioned something about things work better in the cloud. That seems to be the case across all other industries. I've heard mixed things among some of your peers at other payers that would say like, "I don't need my instance in the cloud because all I care about is what percent of my claims are auto adjudicated, which doesn't change, and what percent of them are adjudicated correctly, which doesn't change and so I don't need to move to cloud." Can you expand on what's better about moving to the cloud or what might not be that's distinct about being a health payer versus being a financial institution or any other service provider?

### Expert
The biggest thing I see with payers in the cloud is they're able to manage bubbles in service a lot easier. Outages, they can be bad, but routine maintenance outages aren't as big a deal. You may still have the outage, but assuming you're in the cloud and you're doing, I'm going to use the words best practices, when you come out of your outage, you have scalable processing and other necessary infrastructure to help catch up.

You're paying flexible storage costs instead of fixed storage costs. I think you get frankly a smaller footprint as a whole. I saw this at the larger payer I was at. The amount of excess capacity that had to be purchased and maintained to handle surges goes away.

### Client
I got it. You're saying if all of a sudden your average nightly overnight claims adjudication is four million units and that goes to six million for some strange reason, that'll crash an on-premise system in a way that it wouldn't to cloud system.

### Expert
I'll use the word choke as opposed to crash, but yes. If your normal throughput is four million and you're trying to handle a surge of six million, you're alternatively paying to handle six million all the time and only using four million.

### Client
Interesting. What's your sense of if you look at the percent of the industry that's not running on HealthEdge, which I assume is the vast majority between homegrown systems and TriZetto and the other leading players, how much of all of that would you say is still to be migrated and going to migrate over the next, I don't know, half a decade or seven years or whatever the right time frame is? If we've got like 80% or 90% of the industry that's either homegrown or on some XYZ vendor, how much of that is not yet in the cloud or not modern, let's say? How much of that do you think is going to be up for grabs to be updated?

### Expert
You're looking for firms that are willing to, not just move to the cloud, but willing to throw in the towel and say, "I want somebody else to handle this for me." I get what you're saying. I think Optum, United and Elevance Carelon are too proud to say, "We're going to stop using our homegrown system." They'll invest the resources in migrating it to the cloud on their own. That's my gut. If they wanted to do it, they would acquire a CAPS vendor. I think those would be the two options.

### Client
That's what, 120 million lives between them?

### Expert
There's 120 million. Yeah. United is somewhere right around 50 million. Elevance is like mid-40s million. Elevance already has 15 million of that on Facets though. That 15 million could be up for grabs, conceivably. I think you'll see Centene give it up. I think you'll see Humana and Cigna do the same thing, just based on things I'm seeing in the market right now.

### Client
Interesting. Those are what numbers three through five essentially running?

### Expert
Somewhere right in there. Three, four and five move around a little bit. HCFC is probably going down the same road. They're getting cost-conscious on things. I think it's just as the technology is proven, it becomes a lot easier too. Thinking of HealthEdge, they continue to expand partnerships. They've made the Burgess acquisitions. They plug the primary editor and they still have to solve for content on that primary editor, which they haven't done in four years yet. The benefit of moving I think continues to get higher and higher to the mid-grade plans. Take 330 million lives, carve off the 60-ish million, you've probably still got half the market to go.

### Client
Yeah.

### Expert
You get to deal size then. At some point there's four or five deals that drive the whole thing and then everything else, you got to get 10 Select Health to replace a Molina.

### Client
Yeah.

### Expert
You have to do it. It's like a Monte Carlo more than it is a gross approximation.

### Client
You mentioned that one of the governors here is just like, it's extremely expensive and cumbersome to do this and you have to run multiple parallel systems while you're making sure the new one works, etc. What's the ROI or what's the payback period on the investment required to do the migration relative to the annual savings on the other end?

### Expert
If you make the argument that your implementation cost is going to be equal to one or one and a half years of your license fees, which is probably directionally correct, you need a 25% reduction to make it pay off over the first term of the contract. If you do a five-year deal and you're giving up a year of it to one-time expense at a 25% price reduction, you're even then.

At which point you're getting into the sophistication and the believability of the ROI. You have license costs, you have hosting costs and then you have the indirect administrative costs of, "Is it easier to maintain? Can I do it with lower trained individuals? Do my other system costs go down?" I'm not confident based on my trip through the market that many of your health plans are doing unit cost accounting to that level to be able to tell you what the true cost of processing a claim is.

### Client
Yeah.

### Expert
The closest I got to any of that was a university health system near me and they were one of the few that could actually tell me what it costs to process an appeal.

### Client
What's your sense of how much better or worse HealthEdge is not versus the installed base of TriZetto, but the cloud version of what they're selling now, whether it's Facets or QNXT?

### Expert
I think the operating costs are lower. I think the feature set is a little bit richer. I think the person who's making a move is probably a cost-based buyer, not a value-based buyer. I think HealthEdge will come in a little bit cheaper, but a little bit is what, 10%, 15%?

### Client
Yeah.

### Expert
If you're getting to a jump ball, you probably have a chance. I think it's going to be hard to go to an on-prem TriZetto customer that's looking at going to the cloud without really being able to articulate broader reaching value.

### Client
You're saying if it's just someone who's looking to move to the cloud as opposed to truly change vendors, that's a hard sell?

### Expert
It would be easy for TriZetto to defend the base because they could cut 15% of cost. Margins are fat in this space. You could cut 15% of your cost to increase the risk to make a move significantly. If you're retiring a homegrown system, you're conquering what are the internal costs computed as compared to the vended costs.

### Client
Right. You're saying that's harder.

### Expert
I think it's harder. Nobody has a, "This is my claim system IT department." They always do other things in it. There's ways to move costs around and if you're replacing a homegrown system with a vended system, you know people are losing their jobs in the process. Generally, I'm an optimist on trying to fix healthcare, but every time I have these conversations I hear myself sounding like the complete pessimist and Debbie Downer.

### Client
Yeah. I wanted to ask also about some of these other modules within HealthEdge. They acquired Burgess. They also have this GuidingCare and Wellframe care management platforms. I think they also have a provider data management product beta or in the market. Just curious, maybe if we could take them one at a time, your assessment of how good those are relative to the competitive set, whether it be Zelis or whoever else.

Also where and whether there's a natural tie in with their CAPS system. I don't want to direct your answer at all but maybe you could just correct my impression. To me it feels like the Burgess Source payment integrity piece feels to me like there's just such a natural tie in with adjudication that it surprises me that those two things just aren't together anyway.

I feel like care management and coordination is on the clinical side of what payers do which I suspect is a totally different sale. Anyway, long-winded way of asking the question but maybe we just go through all these other businesses and get your sense of how good they are and whether how well they should be able to cross-sell all this?

### Expert
Right. The Burgess which I think is now HealthEdge Source, definitely related buyers. The integration piece would be highly beneficial especially cloud to cloud. You can solve response times. That seems to be the prevailing performance question is 100 ms, 250 ms, 500 ms seem to be the three-break points, so should have a performance advantage.

They have an integrated pricer which again takes technical debt out of the solution. It streamlines things. They've got a Medicare pricing out of the box that is the industry gold standard unquestioned. What they're lacking and they haven't invested in since the sale of Burgess to HealthEdge, haven't made any huge investments in, is the base clinical content. They have the AMA code sets.

They have done some other NCCI and basic editing, but they haven't invested in mapping many of the clinical societies care standards or InterQual or Milliman guidelines into their edits. That additional stuff will drive the value, 20 to one ROI is common for a Lyric or an Optum CES primary editor. HealthEdge, what was Burgess at the time was involved in a bake-off against Optum in 2021 and across a represent of 10 million life set, the gap between the two solutions was north of $100 million a year in savings. They've got the good technology but they don't have the content. Editors are more based on the content than they are the system performance.

### Client
I thought that Optum solution was, what do you call it, a reocurring, they pay-per-dollar saved solution?

### Expert
Optum, Lyric, typically sell their primary solution based on a license fee, where secondary edits, Cotiviti, etc., are typically sold on a contingency fee.

### Client
Okay.

### Expert
Your primary editor is generally, going through my experience in the industry. I can only think of one or two health plans, both of whom are outside the top 25 that pay for primary on a contingency basis.

### Client
Okay. Is Burgess not both? Burgess is only primary? First pass?

### Expert
It could run either. It could run primary or secondary. The most common deployment of it is in secondary, which still leaves the spot where you have to take HealthEdge. You have to punch it out to, in this case, competitor or another vendor, then you have to get it back and then you process it with CAPS, if you're doing it as a secondary.

### Client
Can you explain again to someone who's not in healthcare, this lack of editing functionality, just exactly what does Optum have that these guys don't, in basic terms?

### Expert
I'll do my best here. Let's say I have the same medical condition twice. I go see two different doctors in two different networks. I get the exact same treatment both times. Those claims when they show up will look differently because there's just different styles in how these things are coded. It could be as a result of one being on a Cerner platform, the other being an Epic platform. It could be based on rev cycle on the back end. It could be based on the leveling of the claim applied based on the interpretation of the notes that the scribe writes up and rev cycle reads.

A primary claim editor's first job is to get all that coding standardized. You want the two claims to look exactly the same from a code perspective inside the claim system to then apply a price and assess if the right care was stolen. You've CMS coding guidelines, which are a set of rules. You have AMA, which license them through 3M, which 3M change names.

There's standards that pick off these things and create groupings that reduce things to single codes. Within that claim, if it's an OB-GYN claim, there's different standards of care for OB-GYN that are documented. It's the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does write standards of, when you treat somebody, this is the way you should treat them and this is how you should code it.

The edits are to take that same text that the docs are using when they write their codes. I'll say providers because you know the doc's not writing his own codes. There's also a responsibility which Optum does, Lyric does, Cotiviti does to some extent to take that and translate the other way to identify instances of incorrect coding.

To furthermore get them to a point of, "Do I reject the claim because the coding is incorrect or because the care was not delivered correctly?" or "Is this just a stylistic difference that makes no difference in what care was actually delivered and therefore should make no difference in how I pay it?" In that content investment when you have a large customer base, Lyric's got ±150 million lives, they can divide that coding exercise across a way broader population.

They continue to develop more and more of these code sets to identify correct or incorrect coding, where someone like a Burgess or a HealthEdge has to divide that same expense over somebody smaller, therefore they don't necessarily go after the specialty code sets quite as much. Saving vaulters.

### Client
I was under the impression that the job of translating all the different EMR standards into something that's injectable into CAPS is that of simply ED effects like the EDI rails. Are they not doing a bunch of data?

### Expert
They do that and they get it in in a common format, but it doesn't necessarily reduce it down to a digestible procedure. They'll do a good job of grabbing the notes and turning it into, it was an OR room charge, it was an anesthesiologist, it was sutures, it was other bits and pieces that add up to a carpal tunnel surgery. That's all standardized so you can interpret it, but then you have to group all that and say, "Actually this whole thing, this isn't 15 steps based on your provider contract. What you're actually telling me is you perform carpal tunnel surgery and therefore it should be paid at a case rate."

### Client
I see.

### Expert
EDI does a good job making all the systems talk to one another and deliver the data. Once it gets in, you have to standardize it to another staff.

### Client
Is it just the Burgess product doesn't have whatever the standards are for nephrology and just can't serve that specialty?

### Expert
They may not have those standards or they leave it to the health plan to write their own code. I've had some good hands-on experience with Burgess. It is a user-friendly product for writing basic edits, but when it comes to out-of-box content, they're typically called knowledge packs or content packages. The Burgess library in 2021 was like 13 knowledge packs. The claims extend knowledge library was like 130.

Not everyone applies to every person. Let's be clear, the sizing may be a little bit different, but there's a huge gap in content that has to be overcome. In the primary space, it's Optum and Lyric are the two that have the content. If you're not getting it in primary at a 20 or 30 to one ROI, you're likely paying somebody like a Cotiviti or a Zelis to clean it up in secondary where the ROI is 10 to one, if you're lucky.

### Client
Who's the other? Cotiviti and who else?

### Expert
Cotiviti, Zelis, Optum are probably the three that offer a secondary content set of any size. Lyric has an offering, it hasn't gotten a lot of market penetration yet. You have Rialtic, which is, I hate to call them a start-up because they've been going for a while, but early stage that was formed out of the previous Cotiviti executive leadership started building a new product.

### Client
Secondary is still before the payment is made. That's not pay and chase?

### Expert
Correct.

### Client
Interesting. What's the distinction? Why is there a difference in prepay passes? Why is there a first pass and a second pass?

### Expert
Your primary edits are generally things that can be sourced back to clinical documentation or a binary policy. You shall get 30 physical therapy visits in a year. The edit straightforward is you deny visit number 31. Most of your secondary content involves a little bit more of a degree of gray, which could be things like, do we really believe, based on the other lines on a claim, that the carpal tunnel should have been coded as a level five versus level four?

You're considering other things that are a little bit more open to interpretation, typically. On secondary, you have a little bit more of a challenge of developing content. You have to do more maintenance of the content because industry trends and things change. You normally have to account for a higher appeal rate, which, whether you're right or wrong, there's still a cost to handling an appeal.

### Client
It's essentially a more sophisticated, for lack of a better term, AI to essentially read the claim. More thresholds, more if-then statements essentially.

### Expert
There are a lot more if-thens. There's typically more frequent updates. One of the bigger secondary concepts is what they call emergency room leveling, which is I have a laceration on my arm. Level five might be, it's three nurses and eight stitches to hold everything together while the doc works. I'm potentially bleeding out where level one is treated with a band-aid. You're trying to decipher the pattern of why is everyone of Doc X's arm lacerations treated as a level five? Is that because he's an experienced surgeon and only gets the hardest cases, or it's because he's trying to see if he could get away with it?

### Client
What do you think is involved in getting up to par with the Optum and the Lyric product first pass?

### Expert
Time and money. It's having some human clinicians that can interpret the policies and convert them to code. It's having negotiating the right licensing deals to get access to code sets for the uses you want to use. It's probably some amount of investment in artificial intelligence or advanced analytics to help distill these policies into smaller chunks to author or to help write the code. It's a massive amount of regression testing and making sure you don't break your other edits in the system.

The last piece of it is having access to a large enough data set to prove the efficacy of what you just built. I was knee-deep in acquisition discussions with Burgess in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Unless they went backwards in technology, which I don't expect they did, I think that technology is there to handle it all. It's just a matter of getting access to the content and dedicating the resources to write the content. Obviously, you have to sell it.

### Client
You said that where the content is really strong is in Medicare.

### Expert
Their Medicare pricing content is second to nobody.

### Client
That's pricing, not editing?

### Expert
That's pricing. They do have the AMA edits configured. Regression testing should be a minor piece of what they do. The way they've written edits where their architecture does not allow edits to be interrelated. Each one can be turned on or off without breaking the others in the sequence. It's a true differentiator that I don't think they market particularly well. The Medicaid markets that they've built out are from a content perspective, better than anybody else's. They're more comprehensive.

### Client
That's on the editing side?

### Expert
That's on the editing side. The problem with Medicaid is infrequently does a state give all the Medicaid business to one health plan. The best second to that would be, "Hey, we'll provide the edit content for y'all to run so that you're all not developing your own." State governments don't do that either.

### Client
Why would they be so strong in Medicaid content and then weaker in other areas like commercial? Is it just that the large majority of what's getting coded is just different for those populations? Medicaid, I would imagine it's a broad base of people.

### Expert
It's a broad base of people, but it's codified and it's highly accessible. If you look at HealthEdge's customer base, like that Blue of Alabama. Blue of Alabama has the bulk of Alabama's Medicaid. The ROI is there to develop Medicaid-specific content for Alabama-specific Medicaid content. Commercial content could get hard because you have providers that negotiate carve-outs or negotiate separation from normal standards of care, like Cleveland Clinic. It has different negotiating power than a local, your regional hospital and the other.

It's a fringe case, but it creates a lot of problems. You get people in border towns that cross borders. You get into, what rules apply? Is it where the person lives? Is it where they see the doctor? Is it where the health plan is located? There's some weird stuff that happens with state insurance agencies and legislatures.

### Client
Interesting. Let's move on to the clinical module, the care coordination modules. What's your assessment of those?

### Expert
I think, broadly speaking, HealthEdge will have a leg up because of the level of integration within the system and the way they built. We talked about that earlier, so I won't go at ad nauseam of it. They should be able to sell a product that turns on and runs that the integration has already done, providing access into the workflows to allow people doing care management.

In my mind, care management is about approving prior office and progression of care. When the data is all connected, it's a lot easier to make inferences on it and to make decisions and then to commit the decisions to both the claim system. If you're virtus integrated as well, I'll call it virtus, to make sure that things pass through.

A big challenge in delivering care and abrasion in this space is prior auth numbers getting dropped or prior auth decisions getting dropped. All the prior off steps may be processed but the claim still gets denied because a system dropped the prior auth on a handoff. That's really positive.

I'm selling against them but they don't really have a provider-facing business per se where TriZetto can go and say, "Look, we do a heavy provider footprint as well, so we understand provider workflows a little bit better." From an efficiency standpoint, it's a good product, but I don't know that it differentiates. I don't think that market is as highly differentiated as the editing or payment integrity market is.

### Client
Because there's just less ROI, essentially, it's harder to measure?

### Expert
It is harder to measure. Most health plans measure on the dollars they spend versus the dollars they don't. Cost avoidance is really hard.

### Client
If you say the nurse that's managing 150 acute patients or whatever in the payer, if you make her time a little more valuable, it's hard to suss out how much that's worth?

### Expert
Right. She's doing 160 patients instead of 150 patients now. You're not capturing the 160 patients that she's working if she's saving $1,000 in care on each patient for the year.

### Client
Yeah. I'm going to use the incorrect terminology, but isn't there a potentially higher accuracy rate? If the system speaks to claims better, would you not avoid the super acute, visit more often or something like that? Is there not as much differentiation on that?

### Expert
I think the differentiation exists. I think the accounting for it is cloudy. If I have good data and I can make these decisions and I can surface data to go make an intercession, fully agree with that. That dollar saved might fall out into a different bucket than the IT bucket that pays for the overall system.

### Client
Yes. This is going to be maybe a related question that I had. I'm under the impression that these are different buyers within the plan. Is that a problem? One is an ops person or a CFO. The other is the CMO of the plan.

### Expert
Right. It ultimately falls down to the financial design of the plan, but who's paying for it? Where in many cases I see primary editors and those things are paid out of an overall IT Ops budget. Even though the content that's delivered is clinic, the unit of measure is dollars saved, which you would think would fall to the chief medical officer. The unit of spend is dollars of IT licenses, so it falls somewhere else.

### Client
I see. There might be some incentives misalignment.

### Expert
It's a big incentive misalignment. You can see, "Hey, we can clinically do so much more over here." "Yeah, but it's more expensive." The IT guys looking at it. CIOs staring at, "I have to cut my budget 3% year-on-year and you're asking me to double my license fee. I don't care that you think you could get 10X the medical savings. I have to ask for more budget, which I can't get."

### Client
Right. You're saying the cost may be borne by IT or the COO, but the benefit accrues to the CMO or is measured?

### Expert
Right. The increase in savings, the benefit goes to somebody else. The cost gets settled on a different party.

### Client
Last question or last topic is this care provider data management stuff that they have, I think it's in beta or it's been in the market for a while, but that they developed internally. What's your sense of how good that is and whether, again there's a natural tie-in to the CAPS system such that they can cross-sell that effectively?

### Expert
I think it's another space that's not overly differentiated, but it could have positive qualitative effects. You can integrate the data and get it done faster and reduce abrasion. I think it's a market where there's not a huge difference in costs between different solutions.

### Client
Not a huge difference in cost. It sounds like what you're saying is not a huge difference in quality, for cost of ownership as a result or ROI.

### Expert
Right. I don't think it's a huge opportunity to save a bunch of dollars, if that makes sense. It might be a better product.

### Client
I would assume that the provider file is just a huge piece of claims adjudication. Is there an advantage to having the same system managing?

### Expert
I'd say only if it's broken. If the system is working, nobody cares. If it's not working, I think it's an easy, "Hey are you having problems with this? If I integrate it, I can solve one of those problems for you."

### Client
Is there not a data quality difference across vendors in terms of how well they're updating all the data that's coming from the marketplace? Providers change addresses or whatever the case may be, want to drop Medicaid, is there not some differentiation on how quickly data can get sucked from third-party sources and updated in the plan?

### Expert
There is a difference between them. The question becomes downstream. What does the data update cycle look like on the backend? From an EDI perspective, how often is the payer pushing the updates they receive into their systems that would affect adjudication. If you're on prem and only doing data updates once a month, If you're getting updates every week, does it really matter?

### Client
Okay. It technically does not matter to the system, but there should be a bunch of loss associated with doing that.

### Expert
Absolutely.

### Client
This has been super illuminating for me. You gathered I'm sure a lot from the line of questioning. Anything else you think is worth mentioning that I didn't ask?

### Expert
If I were asking questions back to you obviously in that, I would be pressing on HealthEdge. I would want to know who have you done this whole suite? How many do you have that are fully sold? What are you doing to create a white paper and write studies and change the narrative around it? You have all these pieces, you bought them in bits and fits and you're theoretically integrating them. Who's bought the entire package? What are you doing to market that package and start changing the narrative?

If I were giving you questions to go investigate. I see in the news they buy pieces, they announce new things, they announce a Zelis partnership, but I have never seen a white paper go up and be like, "Hey look, Thomas Jefferson health plan bought this, this and this, and we put it all together and this is how we save you a bazillion dollars."

### Client
That's interesting. They have this partnership with Zelis. Aren't they competitors now?

### Expert
Yeah. They're like frenemies. Zelis and HealthEdge are close on content. Zelis does the whole payment packaging thing. Zelis is better at payments than just about anybody out there, so it makes sense to do it. It almost has me asking the question is that phase one of a multi-phase product partnership where they try to push the content together. If you have $5 and I have $5, when I push the two together, that doesn't mean I get $10, but I'm going to get more than $5. Does that make them more formidable in the market?

### Client
Okay. Well, thank you again for taking the time to speak with us today. This was very helpful. Enjoy the rest of your day.
