**Discord "daily-gas-station" Content:**
Lyte 06/06/2022
Today's General Advice Share we will explore cognitive dissonance and self worth.
Cognitive dissonance occurs when our beliefs do not align with out actions.
For example, maybe you believe smoking is deadly, but you continue to smoke and rationalize it with another thought such as "But it calms me when I'm angry."
This can work in other ways as well. Maybe you really enjoy riding water rides at a theme park, but your friends are not interested, so you justify not riding them by thinking "It's not fun to walk around in wet clothes anyway."
So what do we do? We can:
- Change the belief (such as now believing "I don't like water rides")
- Change our action (Ride the ride anyway)
- Rationalize our decision (like the example)
Changing beliefs can take time and changing our actions can feel daunting, so oftentimes we rationalize. This can bring some comfort, but it is not always the best decision long term, and it can lower our self esteem.
Sometimes changing the belief or the action (though it takes time) can really improve our self esteem.

## Slide 8: Gamification is not Game Design
Confidential and Privileged

Gamification is not Game Design

# At their best, games provide structured experiences that facilitate discovery, mastery, and growth.

We use game design to drive really engaging and sticky experiences so that Journeyers manifest the meaningful lives they yearn for. We started with the core treatment experience and are now productizing the experience.

**Motivation**
Members join us because they feel broken and want a path to becoming happy, whole, unmessy, valued, contented, enough. Feel "okay."

**Mastery**
Reframe, work through challenges. Map CBT/DBT tools to their lives, show up, do the work. Become more comfortable engaging in vulnerability and connection.

**Feedback Loops**
Immediate positive reinforcement for sharing, reflecting, accountability from therapist and peers. Tracking of symptom improvement. Level up announcements

**Goals:** Autonomy, mastery, self reliance, connection, belonging, peace of mind, control, growth, resilience

**Examples:** You can be as happy as we are (relatedness), you can get there too (competence), we will give you the tools you need to figure it out (autonomy, mastery), with a crew behind you (connection). You're not broken (belonging).

Journeyer Love

# We're more than just mental health support, we're a place to belong.

“I've been here for a while and I've really enjoyed everything you're doing here. It's helped more than any 1x1 therapy I've tried so far honestly. I've just been trying to get my depression under control. I struggle a lot, but I find myself looking forward to these sessions every week.”

**Allie Renee** recommends Hero Journey Club.
Jun 6 ·
HJC has honestly been life changing for me. I'd never found a therapist I've connected with so well before and I've never had the experience of a therapeutic community like this one before. I've felt significantly better since starting sessions with them and can actually feel some of my less than beneficial habits finally loosening their grip. Honestly couldn't recommend the fantastic humans who run HJC more!

**Beignet Boo** recommends Hero Journey Club.
Jun 11 ·
I've been an active member of HJC since I first joined the public Discord in February 11th, 2022. I was curious to see if it was actually good or not, and was surprised to see it was filled with genuine, hardworking people who cared tremendously about the well-being of others, regardless if you were a paying member. I'm 17 years old, kind of in the beginning of my "coming of age" stage and currently trying to not let C-PTSD control my life anymore. These people have been the best support I've ever had. They've held hundreds of clinical journey groups as well as dozens of fun public community quests/events, so just so it's out there, these people really do care. (And they're also very professional.)
Not only have I gotten great advice, helpful resources, and valuable mental health information, I definitely feel like I'm a stronger, more stable individual since joining. I'm incredibly grateful that I get to be a part of HJC. :-) To those struggling mentally, emotionally, or socially, maybe give HJC a shot. The community is absolutely wonderful and welcoming. We're pretty chill.

**Ainsley Stevielle**
I absolutely love Hero Journey Club! I have my second session today, but even just being in the discord server is so so helpful. Everyone works really hard to make it a welcoming space and as someone who tends to lurk in servers, I've actually had a lot of good interactions there and I tend to put myself out there more! I highly recommend them to anyone considering it

I've been doing therapy with Hero Journey Club for a couple months now. The therapists are amazing and the people in my group super cool. I'd put off looking into therapy for ages because of my social anxiety but I figured this was something I could handle. I'm so happy I did. If you're thinking about it I definitely recommend giving them a shot. It's honestly helping me a lot and it's lot more affordable than most other therapy options

## Slide 16: The future of mental health
Confidential and Privileged

# The future of mental health

New tools for a new generation of needs. We will be the first healthcare service layer in the metaverse. We will build the largest dataset available for GenZ mental health, innovate new digital biomarkers for mental illness, and craft 'n of 1' support models that are deeply personalized to specific phenotypes of depression and anxiety.

**Entry Point.**
We will be the entry point for GenZ into our healthcare system, given that behavioral health is their top health concern.

**Embedded.**
Care will be delivered in the context of consumers' lives, particularly as we shift our lives to being more digital.

**Community.**
The future of mental health is rooted in community healing, not individual brokenness.

# Questions
brian@herojourney.club

“What if depression is, in fact, a form of grief—for our own lives not being as they should? What if it is a form of grief for the connections we have lost, yet still need?
You aren't a machine with broken parts. You are an animal whose needs are not being met.”
**Johann Hari, Lost Connections**

“It is impossible to understand addiction without asking what relief the addict finds, or hopes to find, in the drug or the addictive behaviour.
The question is not why the addiction, but why the pain.”
**Dr. Gabor Mate, MD**
