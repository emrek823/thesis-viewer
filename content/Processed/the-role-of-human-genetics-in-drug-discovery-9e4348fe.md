## Slide 4: Human genetics helps to identify potential drug targets to start drug discovery

Human genetics helps to identify potential drug targets
to start drug discovery

**Image Description:**
Top row shows two human figures, one labeled "Disease" and the other "Healthy". The "Disease" figure has a "Target" which a "Drug" is shown to interact with, suggesting a drug targets a specific component in disease.
Right panel shows a human figure with a question mark, representing the challenge of identifying targets.

But, tens of thousands
of potential targets...

...and which one
causes disease?

...and how do you
perturb the target?

**Image Description:**
Bottom row shows two human figures, one labeled "Disease" and the other "Healthy". The "Disease" figure shows a double helix (DNA) with a highlighted section, implying a genetic difference. The "Healthy" figure shows a normal double helix. An arrow points from the "Healthy" DNA to the "Disease" DNA, with a "Drug" symbol shown, implying drug interaction with the genetic difference.

The key steps are:
1. Map genetic differences in those with disease vs healthy;
2. Understand how these genetic differences lead to disease;
3. Develop drugs against these targets that reverse disease processes in the population.

genetic maps of human disease... now we can!

## Slide 7: Example of PCSK9 in drug discovery

There are encouraging examples of this principle
working in drug discovery – example of PCSK9

Many genes influence cholesterol levels and
risk of heart disease

Thanks to new technologies, we can now find
these disease genes...

**(Image Description:**
Top left image shows a cross-section of an artery with "Atherosclerotic Plaque" narrowing the "Blood Flow".
Top right image shows DNA strands, labeled "Disease" and "Healthy", with differences highlighted in the "Disease" DNA.**)

...and design studies to find drugs that fix the underlying molecular defects – for example,
blocking PCSK9 lowers LDL (or "bad") cholesterol in the blood.

**(Image Description:**
Bottom panel illustrates the mechanism of PCSK9 and LDL-C regulation.
Left side: Shows LDL-C (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) binding to LDLR (LDL Receptor) on the cell surface. The complex is internalized into a lysosome. PCSK9 binds to LDLR, leading to its degradation in the lysosome.
Right side: Shows a monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding to PCSK9, preventing PCSK9 from binding to LDLR. This allows LDLR to be recycled back to the cell surface, increasing LDL-C uptake from the blood.**)

Genetics of rheumatoid arthritis contributes to
biology and drug discovery

A list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper

A major challenge in human genetics is to devise a systematic strat-
egy to integrate disease-associated variants with diverse genomic
and biological data sets to provide insight into disease pathogenesis
and guide drug discovery for complex traits such as rheumatoid arth-
ritis (RA)¹. Here we performed a genome-wide association study
meta-analysis in a total of 100,000 subjects of European and Asian
ancestries (29,880 RA cases and 73,758 controls), by evaluating ~10
million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We discovered 42 novel
RA risk loci at a genome-wide level of significance, bringing the total
to 101 (refs 2–4). We devised an in silico pipeline using established
bioinformatics methods based on functional annotation⁵, cis-acting
expression quantitative trait loci⁶ and pathway analyses⁷⁻⁹—as well
as novel methods based on genetic overlap with human primary immuno-
deficiency, haematological cancer somatic mutations and knockout
mouse phenotypes—to identify 98 biological candidate genes at these
101 risk loci. We demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved
therapies for RA, and further suggest that drugs approved for other
indications may be repurposed for the treatment of RA. Together,
this comprehensive genetic study sheds light on fundamental genes,
pathways and cell types that contribute to RA pathogenesis, and
provides empirical evidence that the genetics of RA can provide
important information for drug discovery.

one population but the OR from the other population, could explain
the majority (>80%) of the known heritability in each population
(4.7% for Europeans and 3.8% for Asians). These observations support
our hypothesis that the genetic risk of RA is shared, in general, among
Asians and Europeans.
We assessed enrichment of 100 non-MHC RA risk loci in epigenetic
chromatin marks¹⁰ (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Of 34 cell types investigated,
we observed significant enrichment of RA risk alleles with trimethylation
of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) peaks in primary CD4 regulatory
T cells (Treg cells; P<1.0 × 10⁻⁴⁵). For the RA risk loci enriched with Treg
H3K4me3 peaks, we incorporated the epigenetic annotations along with
trans-ethnic differences in patterns of linkage disequilibrium to fine-map
putative causal risk alleles (Extended Data Fig. 3e, f).
We found that approximately two-thirds of RA risk loci demon-
strated pleiotropy with other human phenotypes (Extended Data Fig. 4),
including immune-related diseases (for example, vitiligo, primary billi-
ary cirrhosis), inflammation-related or haematological biomarkers (for
example, fibrinogen, neutrophil counts) and other complex traits (for
example, cardiovascular diseases).
Each of 100 non-MHC RA risk loci contains on average ~4 genes in
the region of linkage disequilibrium (in total 377 genes). To prioritize
systematically the most likely biological candidate gene, we devised an

Putting it all together...

**Multiple alleles protect from RA**

**(Forest plot: OR of TYK2 alleles and RA)**

| Allele | F     | OR (point estimate) |
| :----- | :---- | :------------------ |
| GGA    | 0.87  | 1.0 (reference)     |
| GGC    | 0.086 | ~0.78               |
| CGA    | 0.038 | ~0.65               |
| GAA    | 0.008 | ~0.5                |

**X-axis (OR):** 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2
**P-value:** P=10⁻²⁵ in >30,000 case-control samples

**Functional studies show LOF**

**(Bar Chart: P-TYK2/TYK2 ratio)**

| TYK2 Genotype | Ratio (Mean) |
| :------------ | :----------- |
| TYK2GG        | ~2.9         |
| TYK2GC        | ~1.6         |

**(Western Blot Image)**
- **+IFNβ (min):** 0, 15 (for TYK2GG and TYK2GC)
- **P-TYK2:** Bands visible, increasing at 15min. Stronger in TYK2GG.
- **TYK2:** Consistent bands.

**Complete KO leads to PID**

**(Pedigree Chart for TYK2 loss-of-function - Simplified depiction)**
- **I:** Unaffected parents
- **II:** Unaffected children
- **III:** Unaffected children, producing offspring in IV
- **IV:** Affected individuals shown in black squares.

**No obvious “ADEs” in ~30K EMR patients**

**(PheWAS Plot: Association (-logP) vs ICD9 Classification categories - Simplified representation)**
- Points are scattered, with some associations for categories like "Type 1 diabetes", "Psoriasis vulgaris", "Rheumatoid arthritis & related disorders".
- The plot shows generally low association for most conditions, except for specific autoimmune/inflammatory ones.

## Slide 28: TYK2 function and therapeutic window

**(Chart: Immune phenotype (low to high) vs TYK2 function (normal to LOF))**
- **Efficacy curve (blue):** Decreases as TYK2 function decreases, indicating protection.
- **Toxicity curve (red):** Increases as TYK2 function decreases, indicating adverse effects.
- **Therapeutic window:** Area between efficacy and toxicity curves.
- **Label 1 (D-TYK2 homozygotes (immunodeficiency)):** Located on the toxicity curve at very low TYK2 function (LOF), high immune phenotype.
- **Label 2 (TYK2 -/- (protection) and TYK2 +/- (protection)):** Located on the efficacy curve at various levels of reduced TYK2 function (from normal to LOF), showing protection.
- **Label 3:** Point on the efficacy curve with significant protection, prior to toxicity, indicating an optimal target inhibition level.

This provides evidence
for the therapeutic
window at the time of
target validation.

Thus, (1) complete LOF leads to immunodeficiency;
(2) partial LOF (+/- heterozygotes) protects from RA; and
(3) -/- homozygotes have greatest protection from RA without
obvious evidence of infection or other ADEs.
