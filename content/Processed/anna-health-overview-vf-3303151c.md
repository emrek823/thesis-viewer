### ANNA
Allied Network for
Neurodevelopmental Advancement

Setting a new standard of excellence in
Autism care, inspiring hope and achieving
remarkable outcomes for children and their
families.

## Slide 2: Autism represents a cost burden of over $3 trillion.

**Autism Prevalence has increased Since 2000 by 317%**

**CDC Prevalence per ADDM***

*ADDM (Autism and Development Disabilities Monitoring Network)

**TACA**
THE AUTISM COMMUNITY in ACTION

*   **Autism rates have increased substantially over the past 30 years, from a combination of higher prevalence and higher diagnosis rates**(1)

*   **Over 2.2 million children have Autism in the United States, yet 25% of those children go undiagnosed**(2)

*   **At $1.4 – 2.4 million in per child lifetime costs, this represents a cost of $3 to 5 trillion**(3)

## Slide 3: Structural challenges in the healthcare system has resulted in Autism diagnosis delays of multiple years, deteriorating outcomes.

**Flow of diagnosis and treatment:**

1.  **Family meets with pediatrician during child's wellness visit**
    *   Pediatricians are not trained to diagnose autism during 15-minute well visit, leading to only 20% of children being diagnosed by age 3(1)
    *   (Red X)
2.  **Pediatrician makes referral to subspecialist**
    *   Developmental pediatrician wait times are 5+ months(2)
    *   (Red X)
3.  **Subspecialist makes referral to ABA clinic**
    *   (Red X)
4.  **Child intake at ABA clinic**
    *   ABA clinic wait times are an additional 5+ months(3)

## Slide 4: Further, ongoing care for a patient with Autism is disjointed, leading to gaps in care, high expense, and poor outcomes.

**Patient Journey with Disjointed Care:**

*   **Patient** connects to:
    *   **Teacher**
    *   **Developmental Pediatrician**
    *   **Speech Language Pathologist**
    *   **Pediatrician** (which connects to Occupational Therapist)
    *   **Behavioral Health Therapist**
    *   **ABA Clinic**

*   The Developmental Pediatrician also connects to the Teacher and the ABA Clinic.

## Slide 5: This current state of Autism care is negatively impacting all three major stakeholders.

*   **Patient Outcomes Deteriorate**
    *   Uncoordinated & delayed care results in deterioration in social skills, self-regulation, coping skills, speech & communication, physical health, and parent-child relationships(1)

*   **Payors Incur Greater Costs**
    *   Current waiting times cost payors $267,000 per patient with Autism(2)

*   **Providers are Burnt Out**
    *   Providers lack quality training, specialist access, and ongoing supervision(3)

## Slide 9: ANNA delivers Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions ("NDBI"), the next generation of gold standard Autism care

### Traditional ABA

**Overview:** Established approach focusing on behavior modification through reinforcement techniques.

*   Overemphasis on compliance and rote skills, sometimes neglecting social and communication development.
*   Minimal focus on generalization and naturalistic learning.
*   Can be overly structured, leading to potential lack of motivation and engagement.
*   Limited consideration of individual preferences and interests.

### NDBI ABA

**Overview:** An innovative approach emphasizing natural environments and social interaction.

*   Emphasizes reciprocal social engagement and meaningful interactions.
*   Integrates a child's interests and preferences, promoting motivation and active participation.
*   Addresses generalization and transfer of skills to real-life settings.
*   Promotes the development of functional communication and social skills.
*   Considers the child's strengths, interests, and developmental level for tailored interventions.

### Positive Outcomes from NDBI

*   **Enhanced Social Communication:** NDBI focuses on developing meaningful social interactions, resulting in improved communication skills, resulting in increased use of gestures, joint attention, and language in natural contexts.
*   **Generalization and Flexibility:** NDBI supports skill generalization across various environments, leading to more flexible and adaptable behaviors, and Skills learned in therapy sessions transfer to real-life settings, promoting independence and improved functioning.
*   **Improved Quality of Life:** NDBI enhances social relationships, social competence, and overall quality of life for individuals with Autism, promoting inclusion, peer interactions, and meaningful participation in community activities.

## Slide 10: Value-Based Care bundles enhance quality, improve access, and lower costs to the system.

### Benefits of Value-Based Care

**Patients and Families**
*   **Comprehensive Care:** Patients receive a coordinated and integrated care package, ensuring all aspects of their needs are addressed.
*   **Improved Access:** Bundled payments reduce administrative burden, enabling patients to access a range of necessary therapies conveniently.

**Providers**
*   **Collaborative Care:** Providers benefit from increased collaboration and coordination, fostering a multidisciplinary approach for optimal patient outcomes.
*   **Greater Earnings Potential:** Bundled payments offer quality-oriented incentive revenue, incentivizing quality care and enabling higher earnings, with less administrative burden

**Payors**
*   **Improved Cost Control:** Bundled payments enable the payor to effectively manage costs by aligning payments with desired outcomes and reducing unnecessary services.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Payors benefit from improved quality assurance through comprehensive, evidence-based care and outcome monitoring.

## Slide 11: ANNA is building the employer-of-choice in Autism care with comprehensive investment into the care team

*   Comprehensive Care Team
*   Extensive Professional Development
*   Cutting-Edge Technology and Resources
*   Company-Level Equity Ownership
*   Strong Leadership and Mentorship from Clinical Team
*   Prioritization of Clinical Excellence
*   Higher Reimbursement Potential from Quality-Contracts
*   Clinical Autonomy with an Emphasis on Outcomes

## Slide 12: There is an unmet demand of over 16,000 clinics to treat children with Autism, 10x the supply currently available.

**Bar Chart Data:**
*   Total ABA Clinics: 1,656
*   Total Necessary ABA Clinics to Meet Demand: 18,333

*   At 100% utilization and 40 Average Daily Census ("ADC"), the current demand for ABA clinic-based therapy is over 18,000 locations.
*   Today, less than 10% of these clinics are available(1), leading to a lack of treatment and crashes in the emergency department.
*   Autism rates continue to grow at 10%+ per year, further straining the system.(2)
