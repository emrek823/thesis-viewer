### George’s Travel and Background Update

- Recent Thailand trip to 4 locations including Khao Sok National Park
	- Floating bungalow experience on lake - beautiful views but basic facilities
	- More logistics-heavy than relaxing due to packed itinerary
- Co-founder background: College friend, former Lyft product manager → head of product at Revolution Business
	- Previous YC-backed healthcare startup (nursing workforce education, 2020)
	- George brings healthcare expertise, co-founder handles product

### Hospital Engagement and Drug Optimization Solution

- 400-bed hospital partnership ($400-500M patient revenue, losing $10M annually since pandemic)
	- Broad mandate from C-suite to identify improvement opportunities
	- Focused on specialty drug spend optimization vs labor cuts
- Cancer center drug administration analysis revealed major losses
	- Example: $2,000 loss per administration on certain specialty drugs
	- Root cause: Pharmacy director optimized for cost only, not profitability
	- Trastuzumab case: 7 biosimilar options, hospital using least profitable
- Solution process requires multiple data sources:
	- Payer contracts for reimbursement rates
	- Medicare ASP files
	- GPO product catalogs (McKesson + 2 others)
	- Rebate schedules
	- Prior authorization success rates
- Results: $350,000 additional margin per oncologist
	- Manual process initially, now productizing into MVP
	- Targeting independent cancer centers and health system-affiliated centers
	- Attended health system pharmacist conference in December, demos this week

### Fundraising Plans and Next Steps

- Fundraising planned for Q1 2026
	- Need to finalize founding engineer vs CTO decision (impacts cash needs)
	- Capital will support productizing, feature development, conference participation
- Product expansion opportunities identified
	- Independent cancer centers using it as financial analysis tool
	- Infusion represents 80% of their business
	- Current process: QuickBooks + manual analysis by CFO/analysts
- Emre attending JPM next week, will reconnect post-conference to continue discussion
