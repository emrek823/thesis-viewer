### Origin Story & Problem Discovery

- Started at Tufts Medical Center
- Identified two key issues through 1000+ conversations:
	- Patients unable to afford medication (observed patient cutting pills in half)
	- Massive biomedical waste bins filled with unused medications
- Won startup competition at Brown University
	- Headquarters initially in dorm room
	- Received $600k worth of cancer medication donations after media coverage

### Medication Waste Dynamics

- Primary reasons for waste:
	- Adverse reactions (patients switching medications)
	- Disease progression (treatment plan changes)
	- Patient passing away ($18k average unused medication value)
- Non-addressable categories:
	- Expired medications (7% of waste, typically low-value)
	- Half-opened/generic medications (e.g., antibiotics)
- Target market: High-value medications ($10k+/month)
	- Focus on HIV/AIDS, neurologic medications

### Donation Process & Incentives

- Individual process:
	- Simple 5-minute online form
	- Free shipping box provided
	- Medication eligibility check
- Motivation factors:
	- Convenience (vs. DEA drug take-back days)
	- Goodwill (helping other patients)
	- Incentive program:
		- Honorary plaques
		- Flowers
		- Monetary compensation (state-dependent)
		- Funeral service support

### Healthcare Facility Partnerships

- UT Southwestern case study:
	- $3M medication reclaimed through 5 doctors
	- 10:1 incentive ratio ($10 worth of medication back for every $100 donated)
	- Planning 5x partnership expansion
	- Driven by nurses and social workers
- Strong organic growth through support groups and social media

### Legal & Regulatory Framework

- Co-authored redistribution laws in 14 of 40 states
- Requirements:
	- Additional licensure needed (pharmacy, manufacturing, wholesale)
	- Specific pharmacy redistribution licenses
- 43 states have supporting regulations

### Business Model & Revenue

- Example through Rightwise (self-insured employer):
	- Claims data analysis to identify eligible patients
	- Direct patient outreach
	- Example: $26k/month Lenvima medication
		- Patient saves $2k out-of-pocket
		- 70% employer savings
		- $2k revenue with 85% margin for Metacircle

### Scale & Vision

- Current status:
	- VillageMD partnership (56,000 patients)
	- 500 patient matches in 3 weeks
- Market opportunity:
	- $50B total medication waste
	- $25B immediately addressable market
- Goal: Become generational business for medication redistribution
- Currently raising funds:
	- First customer CEO invested
	- Planning seed round
	- Strong institutional investor interest
