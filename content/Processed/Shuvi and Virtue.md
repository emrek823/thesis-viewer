### Shuvi’s Background & Journey to Shunya Health

- India, trained as engineer at IIT Delhi, worked at Bain - healthcare/pharma
- Lightspeed India founding team - 2 GPs and him, 2015-2017
	- First investment became unicorn during early India tech ecosystem inflection
- 2017 transition: left for core technology startups vs offline-to-online plays
	- Joined Drishti (computer vision for auto/electronics manufacturers)
	- Real-time video intelligence for productivity/quality control
	- Strong tech but weak business case - cost vs productivity gains misaligned
	- Company eventually acquired by Apple
- Failed startup attempt 2018 - “process of self-discovery, not product discovery”
	- Launched MVPs for 6 different products over a year
	- Lacked clear “why” and commitment to specific space
- Returned to Lightspeed 2018-2024, made partner in 2022
- Personal catalyst: mother’s cancer journey opened eyes to healthcare impact
- 4-6 months in US (April-July 2024) meeting healthcare ecosystem people to understand pain points

### Current Product & Go-to-Market Strategy

- Partnership with large BPO ($2B processed annually, $50M+ revenue, 168 practices, 50-60% oncology)
	- Investor put in $200k after initial acquisition discussions
	- Working with NJ hematology/oncology practice on eligibility/benefits/prior auth
- Product demonstration showed:
	- EHR credential integration using smart RPA
	- Two-day advance eligibility/benefits checking before appointments
	- 6-month patient history extraction for prior auth context
	- Medical necessity review and questionnaire automation
	- 80-90% questions similar across payers, 10-20% payer-specific variations
- Key insight: engineering not the hard part
	- Logic building around complex rules (deductibles, family vs individual coverage)
	- Understanding domain nuances - “employees become half doctors”
	- Clinical reasoning for medical necessity
- Searching for high-velocity wedge with no risk of revenue loss
	- Front office RCM feels like “selling a house” - high barrier to trial
	- Audit-style approaches (like Smara DX model) offer easier entry

### Market Dynamics & Business Model Evolution

- Current manual PA cost $25-50 vs $5 automated pricing
- Success case not $5 × number of PAs - need to monetize pharma side
- Revenue distribution per transaction:
	- Provider: -3% to 3%
	- Payer: 5-6%
	- Pharma: 25% (most incentivized party)
- Strategy to invert business model toward pharma hub services
	- Pharma already spending on similar services (Assistarex, CareMedic)
	- Providers increasingly squeezed: rising costs, declining reimbursements
- Testing adjacencies: 340B compliance, pharma fraud audits, other wedges
	- Need 6-7 conversations in each area before prioritizing
- Must “earn the right to monetize with biopharma” by solving provider/patient problems first

### India RCM Market Context

- $100-150B total RCM spend, $20-30B outsourced
- ~$15B comes to India across hundreds of companies
- Market structure:
	- Dozen companies >$100M revenue
	- Dozens between $10-100M
	- Hundreds between $1-10M
- Four major RCM hub cities, extremely fragmented market
- Every major PE fund has RCM investment
- Provided rapid learning opportunity through existing network connections
