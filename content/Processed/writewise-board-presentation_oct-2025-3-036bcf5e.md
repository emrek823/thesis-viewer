## Slide 4: WriteWise: Bringing Financial Certainty to RX
WriteWise: Bringing Financial Certainty to RX
With our proprietary PBM procurement platform (MavRx) and suite of fixed-cost PBM offerings

**Diagram Description:**
A central node, "MavRx by WriteWise", is connected to "SaaS Marketplace with Broad Coverage Solutions" above it.
MavRx branches out to three offerings below:
1.  **PMPM Guarantee**
    *   The most accurate Solution for budget certainty
2.  **Rx Protect**
    *   Industry Leading Rx
    *   Only Stop Loss Insurance
3.  **Subscription Rx**
    *   Customizable formulary and cost certainty in a subscription chassiy

All three offerings are underpinned by "Leveraging WriteWise Proprietary Predictive Algorithms".

## Slide 5: WriteWise Data Flywheel
WriteWise Data Flywheel

**Diagram Description:**
A circular flow diagram with three nodes:
1.  PBMs provide data (top)
2.  WriteWise improves underwriting (bottom right)
3.  WW wins clients (bottom left)
Arrows indicate a cyclical flow: PBMs provide data to WriteWise, which improves underwriting, which helps WW win clients, which presumably leads to more PBMs providing data.
