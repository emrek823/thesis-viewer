### Product Status & Infrastructure

- Request functionality works and is stable - allows users to request records and receive delivery
- Delivery system operational through multiple vendors:
	- MRO, DataVent (DV), Verisma integration enables 60% of medical record requests
	- System identifies facility and associated parties
	- Current process: Manual drag and drop (workable for up to 2k records)
	- API integrations planned with Verisma, MRO, ShareCare; DataVent more complicated
	- Moving from manual drag-drop to API automation this quarter

### Business Model & Value Proposition

- Single price model offering multiple services to drive platform usage
- Consumer surplus strategy:
	- Site Sonar (with Veritas) - helps find facilities
	- Simple interface with question-based abstraction
	- Claims data integration for patient criteria matching
	- EHR data integrations (e.g., Truveta)
- Simplicity focus: One order includes all features

### Sales & Market Strategy

- Target: Attorney market
	- Using https://apollo.io to harvest email addresses for attorney outreach
	- Systematic sales approach: demos → signups → commitment increase
- Market sizing:
	- Average law firm: 500 record requests/year
	- Top law firms (90th percentile): 10,000-20,000 records/year
- Customer validation cycle: 60-day window to prove delivery
- Measurable results within 30-60 days for upsell opportunities

### Team Structure

- Engineering team delivering consistently
- 3-month contract approach to test performance before full-time conversion
- Daily 9AM standing meetings
- Team includes:
	- Adler (Lead Engineer, Arizona-based)
	- Bruno (Reports to Adler)
	- Jude (Operations Lead, 10 hours/week)

### Strategic Evolution

- Phase 1: Focus on attorney business for immediate flow and revenue
- Phase 2: Early 2026 expansion into tangential markets
- Life Sciences market progression example:
	- $1M revenue (dismissed as “innovation budget”)
	- $5M revenue (6 companies, pre-renewal)
	- $10-15M revenue (usage without consistent renewals)
	- PMF achieved in life sciences division through Aetion acquisition

### Infrastructure Play Opportunity

- Strategic debate: Direct attorney sales vs becoming infrastructure provider
- Infrastructure opportunity:
	- Enable record retrieval companies to flow requests through platform
	- Provide API/LLM capabilities
	- Let retrieval companies handle follow-up
- Scaling advantage: Each retrieval company works with ~600 attorneys
- Market reach: Beyond legal (payment adjudication, providers, life insurance)
- Key consideration: Building sufficient network effects before competitor replication

### Next Steps

- Build API within 90 days for programmatic record requests (Stripe-like model)
- Focus on sales metrics: email outreach → demo conversion → signing rates
- Transition Jude to increased hours based on record request volume
- Plan team expansion as Los Angeles office hub grows
