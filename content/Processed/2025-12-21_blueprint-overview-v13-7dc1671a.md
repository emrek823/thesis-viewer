# My Story

### My Journey

I grew up around healthcare. My parents were both immigrants, my mom a resident who carried me around the hospital and my dad drove a taxi to pay for college. They started CenterPointe—a behavioral health hospital system they owned and operated for 25 years before selling to Acadia in 2021.

My brother started a telebehavioral health company with 1DocWay before selling to Genoa, which was acquired by Advent. He served on the board through the Optum acquisition, where he ran the telebehavioral business for several years before launching his second company focused on Serious Mental Illness.

After starting my career in M&#x26;A, private equity, and venture capital, I joined Triple Aim Partners - a company creation platform. As a GM of NewCo creation, I worked on four companies collectively worth $1.5 billion: two capitated primary care MSOs (Oasis in the Medicare Advantage space and Diverge in the Managed Medicaid space) and two multi-site behavioral companies (Guidelight in the IOP space and Steadfast in the MAT space).

## Remarkable De Novo Economics

### Compounding Value via Playbooks

Companies built with an average investment of $5 million transacted for over $1 billion each. This was exemplified by the successful exits of Prospero and ArchWell, both sold for over $1 billion. Institutionalized playbooks across portfolio companies for key functions like market selection, payor development, and recruiting ensured each successive company became more valuable than the last.

# ANNA—NDBI Centers of Excellence

ANNA was founded on the insight that traditional Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) was ineffective and even harmful to young children, and a novel model of clinical interventions, Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI), was the most evidence-based model of care. NDBI was a wedge by which we could create tech-enabled centers of excellence.

## Challenges in Traditional ABA : Discrete Trial Training

| **Traditional ABA**                                   | **ANNA Care Model: Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions** |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rote Learning Focus                                   | Natural Context Learning                                                  |
| Limits generalization of skills, making them hard to apply in real life. | Emphasizes learning in natural contexts, ensuring skills transfer to real-life situations. |
| External Reinforcement                                 | Intrinsic Motivation                                                     |
| Can lead to over-reliance on rewards and diminish intrinsic motivation. | Emphasizes child-initiated activities, fostering deeper learning and self-drive. |
| Discrete, Adult-Led Instruction                       | Play-Based &#x26; Social Interaction                                          |
| Less natural and can hinder spontaneous social engagement and interaction. | Incorporates natural contingencies and developmental principles for better social engagement. |
| Rigid Structure                                       | Flexible, Play-Based Routines                                           |
| Increases anxiety or resistance, especially for young children with autism. | Reduces stress and is more suitable for young children, encouraging participation. |
| Limited Family Involvement                             | Active Parent Partnership                                                |
| Parents are less empowered and involved in their child's therapeutic progress. | Involves parents as active partners, enhancing consistency and improving outcomes. |
| Fragmented Care                                       | Integrated Care                                                         |
| Difficulty in coordinating multiple therapies, leading to disjointed treatment. | Fosters collaboration between behavioral, speech, and occupational therapies for holistic support. |

# ANNA's Launch

ANNA opened our first location in Sudbury, Massachusetts in February 2024 with a novel hypothesis: Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI) represented both superior clinical care for autistic children and a model actively sought by referral sources and families. The response was immediate.

# Proving the Multi-Site Playbook

## Wayland Success
We opened our second center in Wayland, Massachusetts and grew from 0 to $1.6 million in ARR within just 6 months—growing at a faster rate than our Sudbury center and definitively proving out the multi-site playbook.

Each new center unlocks entirely new sub-markets with their own referral networks, talent pools, and family populations - enabling parallelized growth.

## Weston Launch
Building on this proven model, our newest location in Weston, Massachusetts, became active this month. We've already secured 5 full-day-equivalent (FDE) clients waiting to start services, creating an opportunity for Weston to achieve profitability within its very first month. This rapid success highlights the increasing efficiency and predictability of our multi-site expansion strategy, with each successive launch demonstrating even faster ramp-up times and stronger financial performance.

# ANNA's Four Core Advantages

| **Clinical Excellence** | **Talent Recruitment** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Repeatable, scalable approach to delivering high-quality NDBI services that outperform traditional ABA across all major developmental domains in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Score. | Repeatable, scalable methodologies to recruit and develop clinical talent with 2.7% BT acceptance rate and 10.5% BCBA acceptance rate. |

| **Family Attraction** | **Economic Efficiency** |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Repeatable, scalable, and profitable channels of attracting families through superior outcomes and brand-led flywheel. | Consistently strong and improving unit economics with 10x cash flow / investment economics for exponential organic growth. |

The core advantage arises from the compounding benefit of layering each function upon the other. Superior clinical outcomes attract both the best talent and families, which drives word-of-mouth growth, which enables favorable payor contracting at 20-40% above rack rates.

# Massachusetts Market Strategy

Our real estate approach in Greater Boston consists of identifying 7 core markets that make up the region: Middlesex, Central, North Shore Inside 95, South Shore Inside 95, North Shore, South Shore, and Worcester County—opening locations in each.

| Locations Secured | PF ARR |
|-------------------|--------|
| 4 open locations, 1 in construction, and 3 LOIs signed | $40mm |

Across just these 8 locations:

| PF Contribution Profit |
|------------------------|
| $16mm |

Making Massachusetts highly profitable after deducting ~$4M corporate expense.

Key Insight: Each sub-market can support more than 1 fully-ramped center. At 3 centers per sub-market, this represents a $105 million top-line opportunity in Greater Boston alone—before considering Springfield and other large metros in Massachusetts.

# Market Entry Framework

| Licensing                    | Payor Contracting                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Licensing with the state     | Contracting with commercial and government payors. |

## Acquisition
Accelerates all workstreams

| General Manager Recruitment   | Real Estate                                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Recruiting a market-level GM | Site selection and leasing                    |

The market entry process involves four main workstreams that are often pursued in parallel:
- Licensing with the state: Securing necessary regulatory approvals
- Contracting with Payors: Establishing agreements with insurance providers.
- Recruiting a GM: Identifying and hiring local leadership.
- Real Estate: Locating and securing physical premises.

An alternative, fifth workstream, Acquisition, can significantly accelerate market entry by automatically unlocking or expediting the licensing, contracting, and real estate processes, allowing for a faster and more integrated market penetration.

# The AI Scribe / Documentation Assistant

The AI Scribe / Documentation Assistant automatically writes notes using session data collection, reducing documentation time from 5 minutes to just 1 minute per session.

| **Client First Name:** |  | **Client DOB:** | 3/3/2021 | **Client Age:** |  |
|------------------------|--|------------------|-----------|----------------|--|
| **Session Start Time:** | 2:00 PM | **Session End Time:** | 4:30 PM | **Staff Name and Credentials:** | BCBA Present No |
| **Client Presented:** | Energetic, Active | **Client Transitioned:** | Not presenting behaviors of concern |  |  |

### Summary of Protocols Used:
- Continuous Measurement Procedures
- Naturalistic Teaching
- Chaining
- Shaping
- Prompting (prompt and prompt fading)
- Stimulus Control Transfer
- Antecedent Intervention
- Differential Reinforcement (DRA/DRO)
- Pairing
- Functional Communication Training

### Objective Observations:
During the session, the client demonstrated functional communication skills by practicing providing a location before walking away; however, all four attempts required full vocal prompts, with one instance of withholding assent. He independently used the phrase "Can I jump on your?" in a social communication context. In the program "Follow Routines," he successfully completed tasks such as cleaning up, getting his water bottle, putting on and packing his backpack, putting on shoes, and going to the bathroom, all independently. However, during the activity "tolerates teacher's choice (alternating every other)" within the program "3.1 Follow Visual Schedule," showed a 30% success rate in tolerating the teacher's choice. A single incident of aggression towards an adult was observed during the session. The client was very active today and he was able to share with his peers; he did require some space at times which he would independently ask for. He was later flexible for progressing to his schedule to receive time to watch videos on his iPad.

### Assessment:
Progressing toward treatment plan goals.

### Plan for Treatment:
Continue treatment plan.

----

- **Economic impact:** $12,480 additional BCBA value + $10,816 BT revenue
- **Why this matters:** Frees clinicians from administrative burden to focus on patient care.
- **Clinical benefit:** More accurate, consistent documentation while allowing clinicians to be fully present during sessions.

| **Safety Skills**     | The client demonstrates emerging expressive and receptive language skills with notable strengths in labeling familiar objects and requesting basic needs. Spontaneous vocalizations occur throughout the day, though conversational exchanges remain limited. |

### Expressive Language:
- Uses single words consistently and short 2-3 word phrases in structured settings.
- Relies on prompts to expand utterances beyond immediate needs.
- Tacts common items (e.g., food, toys) but has difficulty labeling actions or attributes.

### Receptive Language:
- Follows one-step instructions consistently and some two-step directions with visual cues.
- Responds to familiar questions such as "Where is _?" or "Give me _," though accuracy decreases with abstract or novel terms.
- Demonstrates partial understanding of prepositions (e.g., in, on, under).

## Economic Impact
- **$19,440** BCBA billable value from reclaimed time.

## Why This Matters
- Transforms treatment planning from a 12-hour manual process to streamline augmented process.

## Clinical Benefit
- Ingests and utilizes a comprehensive set of patient data for individualized care while maintaining ANNA’s clinical protocols at scale.

# Pediatric Mental Health: Deep Dive

Individuals with autism are 25x more likely to make a suicide attempt than non-autistic adults. This critical adjacency to autism care is important not only for more effective autism services but also for more effective delivery of pediatric behavioral health overall for the 1 in 5 children with mental health conditions.

The superior clinical model combines Parent-Management Training (PMT), actively engaging parents in clinical service delivery, with Modular Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MCBT), a more flexible application of CBT to better fit individual needs of children and adolescents.

| Investment to Breakeven | 5-Year Mature Annual Profit | Return on Invested Capital |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| $240K                   | $3.8M                       | 15x+                        |

- P&#x26;L spend to reach profitability
- Per center at maturity
- Before applying 20x multiple to cash flow stream value

The center-of-excellence continuum of care—outpatient therapy, medication management, and IOP/PHP for group therapy—improves go-to-market efficiency as patients engage in multiple services across the continuum over time.

# The Blueprint Opportunity

## $2.5 Trillion Healthcare Services Market

AI has unlocked an entirely new frontier within healthcare services, creating an opportunity to transform care delivery via the repeatable creation of category-defining healthcare businesses. The opportunity for Blueprint Health compounds the remarkable de novo economics we've already proven at ANNA and sets a foundational opportunity to leverage core infrastructure to build a generational company creation engine.

This transformation begins with the clinical model itself. AI has enabled the transformation of clinical care delivery to be aligned with the highest quality, evidence-based practice at scale via tools like AI LMS, AI clinical fidelity, and AI wraparound clinical care delivery plugging the gaps between care.

The opportunity is not just to build a category-defining business, but to build a business that redefines the category of healthcare services.

# Why Vertical Integration Wins

The far and away most common path for companies embracing AI today is to build the application layer on top of foundational models rather than vertically integrate into owning the economics of the end customer. While this will create valuable businesses, three key insights make vertical integration more compelling:

| Last-Mile Problem                          | Limited Pricing Power                      | Value Capture                          |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Within healthcare, AI at the application layer struggles from a last-mile problem. Healthcare companies are too idiosyncratic in their workflows and technology stacks for pure horizontal applications. We couldn't purchase an AI treatment plan automation tool off-the-shelf because our clinical model is unique and our EMR is customized. | Pricing power for AI applications is generally limited. With the cost of development collapsing due to increasingly effective AI tooling, the replacement cost of insourcing a previously outsourced AI application is substantially lower. Traditional software relied on economies of scale and high replacement costs to justify pricing. | The profit pools have expanded so drastically that the point of leverage is in the residual owner of that profit pool rather than the tooling that enables its creation. AI applications create exceptional value, but the dollar amount largely accrues to the customer. |

# De Novo vs. Acquisition Economics

An M&#x26;A playbook leveraging AI can acquire a 20% margin asset at 7.5x, double top-line and double margin to 40% to flip for a 4x return. But the real value creation occurs when rather than buy at 7.5x, you can build at 0.1x for a 300x return.

| Acquisition Economics                          | Pie Ai           | Post AI            | De Novo Economics                        | Pre Ai  | Post/AI |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| Single Unit Revenue                            | $5,000,000       | $10,000,000        | Single Unit Investment to Breakeven     | $100,000| $100,000|
| Single Unit Margin                             | 20.0%            | 40.0%              | Single Unit Revenue                      | $5,000,000| $10,000,000|
| Single Unit Investment                         | $31,000,000      | $94,000,000        | Single Unit Margin                       | 20.0%   | 40.0%   |
| (x) Financial Value / Financial Multiple      | 7.5x             | 75                 | Single Unit Investment                   | $1,000,000| $4,000,000|
| Purchase / Sale Price                         | $7,500,000       | $30,000,000       | ( ) Intrinsic Value / Financial Multiple | 7.5x    | 7.5x    |
| (S) Roundtrip Expense                         | $57,391,000      | $37,400,000       | Enterprise Value                         | $7,500,000| $30,000,000|
| Return on Invested Capital                    | 1.0x             | 4.0x              | ( ) Single Unit Investment to Breakeven | $100,000| $100,000|
|                                                |                  |                    | Return on Invested Capital               | 75.0x   | 300.0x  |

The acquisition multiples are expanding to fair market value as the market recognizes AI transformation potential. The arbitrage window is closing for M&#x26;A, but wide open for de novo creation.
