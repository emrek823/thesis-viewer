Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker last Friday signed a bill into law banning the use of artificial intelligence from providing mental health services, aiming to protect residents from potentially harmful advice.

Known as the [Wellness and Oversight for Psychological Resources Act,](https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocTypeID=HB&DocNum=1806&GAID=18&SessionID=114&LegID=159219) the law prohibits AI systems from delivering therapeutic treatment or making clinical decisions. The legislation still allows AI tools to be used in administrative roles, such as scheduling or note-taking, but draws a clear boundary around direct patient care.

Companies or individuals found to be in violation could face $10,000 in fines, enforced by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.

“The people of Illinois deserve quality healthcare from real, qualified professionals and not computer programs that pull information from all corners of the internet to generate responses that harm patients,” Mario Treto, Jr., Illinois’ financial regulation secretary, said in [a press release](https://idfpr.illinois.gov/news/2025/gov-pritzker-signs-state-leg-prohibiting-ai-therapy-in-il.html). “This legislation stands as our commitment to safeguarding the well-being of our residents by ensuring that mental health services are delivered by trained experts who prioritize patient care above all else.”

The new legislation is a response to growing concerns over the use of AI in sensitive areas like health care. The Washington Post [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/05/31/ai-chatbots-user-influence-attention-chatgpt/) last May that an AI-powered therapist chatbot recommended “a small hit of meth to get through this week” to a fictional former addict.

Last year, the Illinois House Health Care Licenses and Insurance Committees held a joint hearing on AI in health insurance in which legislators and experts warned that AI systems lack the empathy, accountability or clinical oversight necessary for safe mental health treatment.

“When we talk about AI, it is already outpacing the human mind, and it’s only a matter of time before they outpace our structures and our systems — particularly when it comes to regulations and healthcare,” state Rep. Bob Morgan, who chairs the House’s health care licenses committee, said during the [hearing](https://repbobmorgan.com/news/health-care-licenses-insurance-committees-hold-joint-subject-matter-hearing-on-artificial-intelligence-ai/).

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has also [indicated](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/08/04/desantis-artificial-intelligence-policy/85473530007/) that state-level AI regulations are coming soon in his state, calling artificial intelligence “the biggest issue” facing society and the economy. DeSantis said Florida will develop its own AI policy in the next few months.
