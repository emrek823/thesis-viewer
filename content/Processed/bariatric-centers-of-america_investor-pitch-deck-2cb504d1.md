## Slide 3: Our Mission

Our Mission
To cure the disease of obesity in the communities we serve in an effort to improve health and reduce cost of care.

## Slide 4: The Problem with the Obesity Market

The Problem
with the Obesity
Market

## Slide 5: Obesity Market

Obesity Market
Obesity is a major driver of healthcare costs and negatively impacts quality of life.

Obesity dramatically increases health care costs for:
1.  Federal, State, and Local Government
2.  Private Sector Employers
3.  Individuals, both Insured and Uninsured

Obesity negatively impacts quality of life:
*   One of the most common remarks of successful weight loss surgery patient: "I got my life back"

### Obesity Impact Data:
*   **10 Years**: Reduction in life expectancy on average
*   **50 to 100%**: Increased risk of premature death
*   **5th**: Leading cause of death in the world
*   **40**: Medical conditions/diseases are associated with obesity
*   **40%**: Of all diagnosed cancers in the U.S are obesity-related

Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

## Slide 6: Patient Market

Patient Market
Despite the dangers of obesity, nearly 40% of the US adult population is obese.

Half of individuals in Class II Obesity (BMI 35+) and all of individuals in Class III Obesity (BMI 40+) are eligible to have surgery (29.3M adults).

Yet, less than 1% of eligible individuals are seeking this form of treatment (260K bariatric procedures performed each year).

### Bariatric Surgery Potential vs. Actual:
*   **29.3M**: Potential Candidates for Bariatric Surgery
*   **260K**: Current bariatric surgeries being performed each year

## Slide 7: Provider Market

Provider Market
And, bariatric surgeons are not performing at peak capacity.

The average bariatric program in the U.S. performs 300 bariatric procedures a year. The average bariatric surgeon performs 65 bariatric procedures a year.

A busy bariatric surgeon is expected to perform 200+ cases per year.

### Bariatric Provider Market Statistics:
*   **4,000**: Active Bariatric Surgeons
*   **864**: Bariatric Programs in the US
*   **300**: Bariatric surgeries per program per year
*   Bariatric surgery volume growth: '21 to '27 CAGR: 8.1%

## Slide 8: Bariatric Market

Bariatric Market
Not to mention, the delivery of care to the bariatric patient is fragmented and confusing.

On average, it takes a bariatric patient 180 days to get to surgery after their initial consult date.

*   **Lengthy patient journey** of ~2 years to decide if they want to have bariatric surgery.
*   **Very limited access to care**, with only 20% of short-term acute care centers offering bariatric services.
*   **Lack of support for patients** to complete an often arduous process, from first visit to surgery, with only 40% of patients making it to surgery in most programs.
