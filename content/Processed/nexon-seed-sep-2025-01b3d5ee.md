## Slide 2: Market Opportunity

Market Opportunity
GenAI has massive potential to eat healthcare admin labor with software.

**Healthcare Spend & Admin Spend**

| Year | Category          | Spend       |
| :--- | :---------------- | :---------- |
| 2015 | Admin Spend       | $650B       |
| 2024 | Healthcare Spend  | $5.0T       |
| 2024 | Admin Spend       | $1.1T       |

*Note: Admin Spend shows a 5% CAGR from 2015 to 2024 (from $650B to $1.1T)*

*   18% of US GDP covered by healthcare
*   2:1 admin hours vs patient-facing hours
*   1 in 3 healthcare workers in admin roles
*   45% of physicians reporting burnout
*   30% of admin spend directly wasted

02

## Slide 3: Problem

Problem
But current AI products focus on low-leverage, commoditized uses & avoid the critical workflow bottlenecks that determine whether providers can function at all.

**Common Products**

*   **Medical Scribes**
    *   Freed AI, Abridge
*   **Scheduling Agents**
    *   Assort Health, Elise AI

**Unsolved Needs**

*   **Orders, Codes, & Structured Data Entry**
    *   Scribes comprise <5% of admin staff
*   **Prior Auth Appeals & Escalations**
    *   >50% of calls go beyond scheduling
*   **L2+ Denials & Post-Claim Payor Audits**
    *   $14K average denial vs $32 RVU increments

## Slide 6: GTM

GTM
We're starting with $40B of spend across independent surgical practices in targeted specialties, where economics hinge on high-value, overhead-intensive procedures.

**Top 3 Procedure Code Spend by ASC Specialty**
Average reimbursement per procedure from $8K - $31K

| Specialty        | 2020 Spend | 2022 Spend | 2024 Spend |
| :--------------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| Orthopedics      | $21B       | $22B       | $24B       |
| Ophthalmology    | $8.1B      | $8.7B      | $9B        |
| Pain Management  | $3.6B      | $3.9B      | $4B        |
| Vascular Surgery | $2.1B      | $2.3B      | $2.5B      |

*   Just 4 procedures drive spend – arthroplasties, infusions, SCS insertions, & atherectomies
*   Massive reimbursement at stake, up to $50K or more for most complex services
*   Heavy prior auth and L2/L3 claims review burden necessary for reimbursement
*   Top targets for audits & clawbacks, with flawless documentation needed for defense
*   Essential revenue sources for independent ASC financial solvency

06

    *   Portal Submission
*   **Claim Submission**
    *   Claim Review & Scrubbing
    *   Initial L1 Denial Management

## Slide 8: Why Now?

Why Now?
Healthcare AI is at an inflection point – providers now trust the technology and are desperate for life-or-death solutions to payor & regulator-imposed admin that drain 25% of revenue.

**Key Statistics**

*   **72%**: of healthcare execs plan to increase AI investments in NTM
*   **4 in 5**: providers report admin overhead often or sometimes prevents treatment
*   **85%**: of providers believe admin overhead is #1 source of burnout
*   **$140B**: worth of clinician time spent on admin work annually
*   **68%**: of providers are open to using AI for admin automation
*   **200K**: annual job openings for healthcare admin positions

**% of providers exploring AI by use case**

| Use Case       | Percentage |
| :------------- | :--------- |
| Coding         | 73%        |
| Documentation  | 66%        |
| PA             | 62%        |
| Denials        | 62%        |

Interest in healthcare AI from provider organizations spans all key administrative workflows.
