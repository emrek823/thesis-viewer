## Slide 7: Costs increase exponentially with disease progression.

Costs increase exponentially with disease progression.

**Chart: Mean Annualized Costs Per Patient By CKD stage, Medicare FFS Group**

**Costs (Bar Chart Data):**
*   CKD 1: $8K (12M Patients)
*   CKD 2: $14K (8M Patients)
*   CKD 3A: $21K (14M Patients)
*   CKD 3B: $27K (1.6X increase from CKD 2 to CKD 3A, 1.7X increase from CKD 3A to CKD 3B - these multiplier labels seem misplaced visually, likely referring to the entire progression)
*   CKD 4: $46K (2.3X increase from CKD 3B to CKD 4) (1M Patients)
*   Kidney Failure: $130K (500K Patients)

**Note:** The multipliers (1.6X, 1.7X, 2.3X) are placed visually above the bars in the chart. Without clear lines, it's hard to definitively say which transitions they represent, but based on placement, they are likely indicating relative increases between stages. The OCR identified them as "1.6X, 1.7X, 2.3X" for specific bars, but visually they are arrows between stages. The text descriptions (e.g., "1.6X increase from CKD 2 to CKD 3A") are my interpretation based on visual proximity.

**Additional Data:**
*   For commercial patients: $350K-$700K

Kidney care is broken: Nephrologists prioritize lucrative dialysis patients, neglecting early-stage kidney care.

Reset

**7 in 10** CKD patients aren't seeing a Nephrologist.

**Those referred to local Nephrologists face barriers:**
1.  Long wait times and inconvenient appointments
2.  Lack of active engagement from Nephrologists
3.  Lack of Nephrologist-PCP Coordination

**Outcomes:**
*   Faster progression to kidney failure
*   Frequent hospitalizations
*   50%+ dialysis patients "crash into" dialysis

# Mission

Extend the health spans of
CKD patients by delaying
kidney failure and
increasing transplants
through compassionate,
superior care.

## Slide 11: How are we solving these challenges?

Virtual and at-home kidney care, starting in rural areas, through a fully controlled clinical model that is NP-driven, Nephrologist-guided

# How are we solving these challenges?

**Quick Access**
*   Specialty care in 2-weeks, not 2-months

**High Care Quality**
*   Fully controlled care model through in-house Nephrologists and Nephrology-NPs
*   Care protocols based on the latest research, built right into the workflow
*   Multidisciplinary care proven to slow CKD

**Superior Patient Experience**
*   No-rush appointments, so patients feel heard
*   Doctor-patient relationship based on trust and empathy, leading to higher engagement
*   Convenient virtual visits and at-home care.

**Diagram: Reset Care Model**

**Virtual Visits**

Tailwinds from recent RAF changes.

Higher HCC Weights for CKD,
combined with high CKD prevalence,
offer a massive financial opportunity
for MA Plans.

Reset maximizes this by engaging CKD
patients and ensuring accurate coding.
