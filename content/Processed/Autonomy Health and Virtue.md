### Product Development & Commercial Progress

- PA (Prior Authorization) product deployed with 2 clinics
	- Texas Neurology and MIND clinics showing strong early traction
	- Key insight: Large group asked “how fast can you get up and running?” - wanted deployment “tomorrow” not end of Q1
	- Strong signal of early product-market fit
	- Acting as effective wedge product - groups seeing value in “one cohesive technology stack” vs standalone solutions
	- Michigan practice CEO already discussing EMR migration after PA demo
- Build vs. buy learnings from PA rollout
	- “Build nothing - if we can buy, we can move faster”
	- Working with contract engineers creates limitations
	- Key lessons learned:
		- Always takes more time than expected with unforeseen roadblocks
		- Identify 3-4 critical things to own and build those
		- Auth was necessary to build - no great market solution available
		- Mandolin struggled to convert contracted ARR into actual revenue
- Current contracted revenue pipeline ($900K total potential):
	- Texas contract: $300K contracted revenue
		- Launched referral workflow
		- Starting end-to-end prior authorizations and billing in 2 weeks
		- Finishing dashboarding work and billing integration
	- Asheville MSO: $400K contract
		- Targeting November signature
		- Launching PA solution in meantime while bundling full EMR migration
	- Single physician practice (2 NPs): $200K contract
		- MSA out to practice with strong intent to move quickly
- Three core proof points to establish:
	- Migrate people to Athena
	- Take over billing operations
	- Launch infusions successfully

### Hiring Challenges & Engineering Capacity

- Top funnel recruitment proving difficult
	- Many excited candidates ultimately say “too early for me”
	- Candidates who seem promising often “bomb” technical interviews
	- 3-5 candidates currently in pipeline that team likes
	- Competitive market making offers challenging
- Current approach and recalibration:
	- Underestimated time required and candidate interest levels
	- Now sending 5x more outreach than originally planned
	- Working with dev shops, contract engineers, and full-time candidates
	- Speed is critical - sales significantly ahead of engineering capacity
	- Can execute MSO contracts without engineering team (proven with Manhattan group)
	- Risk of missing PA product opportunity window

### Strategic Partnerships & Market Positioning

- AAN (American Academy of Neurology) partnership formalizing
	- Rolling out trusted vendor program for ~15 companies
	- Autonomy Health positioned well due to existing relationship and David’s board connection
	- Fall conference in 2.5 weeks as key selling event
- NeuroNet relationship development:
	- Met with Mary (AN president) who “loved” the product despite early UI
	- Her connections at MGH and other hospital systems interested
	- Structuring partnership where NeuroNet gets fees for sales referrals
	- Autonomy Health gets revenue share for driving drug volume
	- Targeting small equity investment with ROFO/ROR in 6-12 months
	- Need to prove value delivery before advancing acquisition discussions
- Additional strategic initiatives:
	- Exploring benefits/malpractice insurance offerings (Pelto model from orthopedics)
	- Planning AI hackathon for February conference
	- Pursuing speaking slot on AI applications in healthcare
