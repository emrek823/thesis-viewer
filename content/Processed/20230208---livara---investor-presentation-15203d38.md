## Slide 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Livara is leading the transformation of value-based MSK care

* We focus on MA and fully insured populations, not ASO or worried well
* We deliver personalized care journeys based on >1 million patient data points and cover the widest range of MSK conditions, including scoliosis, articular cartilage, degenerative changes, neuro changes and more
* The only MSK partner with integrated online and in-clinic experience to breakdown care siloes

## Slide 4: THE CURRENT PATIENT EXPERIENCE IS SUB-OPTIMAL IN MSK CARE

(Flow chart with 5 steps)

**STEP 1**
A patient presents to their PCP with back pain stemming from lifting some heavy boxes in the garage. Light pain medication is prescribed, but the patient schedules another visit within 2 weeks with persisting pain.

**STEP 2**
As a precaution, the PCP orders an MRI which shows a ruptured disc. Another referral is made to pain management for a steroid injection.

**STEP 3**
The patient, frustrated by the lack of improvement, schedules an appointment with a surgeon who advises a surgery is needed and can be scheduled in two weeks.

**STEP 4**
Naturally resistant to surgery, the patient schedules with physical therapy, but it is not coordinated with your care team, not engaged and ineffective - and they drop out after a few sessions.

**STEP 5**
At this point, the patient is firmly on an operative track.

Our patients love us

"I have suffered with back and neck pain off and on for over 20 years. I have tried everything - physical therapy from 3 different outfits, shots in my spine and neck, prescription pain patches, etc - and nothing made much of an improvement until I tried Livara. It's hard to describe how transformative it is to finally be able to move about normally. I am really grateful to Livara."
