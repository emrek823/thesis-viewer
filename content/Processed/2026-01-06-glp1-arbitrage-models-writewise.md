# GLP-1 Creates Four Distinct Arbitrage Opportunities — WriteWise Positioned for Two, Missing Two

**Lead take:** The GLP-1 explosion is creating derivative value pools that sit between manufacturers, PBMs, and employers. Four business models are emerging to capture this arbitrage: (1) cooperative purchasing (Andel), (2) financial guarantees (Cigna EncircleRx, WriteWise), (3) direct-to-employer bypass (Lilly D2E), and (4) integrated Rx stop-loss. WriteWise is well-positioned on #2 and #4 but faces competition from Cigna's 9M-enrollee head start on guarantees and has no play on cooperative purchasing or D2E bypass.

**Confidence:** HIGH — Multiple independent sources confirm market structure. WriteWise vault materials validate product-market fit.

## The Four GLP-1 Arbitrage Models

### Model 1: Cooperative Purchasing (Andel)

**Mechanism:** Pool employer demand → negotiate directly with manufacturers → bypass PBMs entirely.

[Andel raised $4.5M](https://techfundingnews.com/andel-raises-4-5m-to-close-glp1-coverage-gap/) in October 2025 from Lightbank, Seedcamp, Bertelsmann. Founded by Jay Bregman (ex-Hailo) and Ritu Malhotra (ex-CVS Health).

Key features:
- Employers pay nothing; employees pay small monthly fee
- Direct manufacturer negotiation cuts PBM spread
- App handles prescription verification, delivery, management
- Launching nationwide early 2026

**WriteWise fit:** None. WriteWise works WITH PBMs (forcing transparency via bid auctions), not around them. Andel's model is fundamentally different.

### Model 2: Financial Guarantees (Cigna EncircleRx, WriteWise)

**Mechanism:** Cap employer cost exposure through underwriting + clinical steerage.

[Cigna EncircleRx](https://www.evernorth.com/articles/evernorth-announces-industry-first-financial-guarantee-glp-1-spend) launched March 2024, now covers 9M enrollees:
- 15% annual cost increase cap on Wegovy/Zepbound
- Requires Omada lifestyle program participation
- $200/month member cost cap via manufacturer agreements
- 92% 12-week persistence rate

**WriteWise positioning:** PMPM Guarantee product is thesis-aligned but smaller scale (~30K employees vs 9M). Per vault [[cendana-qa-writewise-spv_6525-803b5c0a.md]]:
- *"GLP-1s are driving 29% of the total increase in drug spending for employers"*
- Clinical steerage: *"Tirzepatide after ≥5% weight-loss failure, 90-day re-auth, coupon maximizer"*
- Current loss ratios: PMPM Guarantee 4%, RxProtect 0.3%

**Competitive dynamics:** Cigna has distribution (9M lives) and manufacturer deals. WriteWise has better unit economics (4% loss ratio vs. 15% cost cap) but lacks scale.

### Model 3: Direct-to-Employer Bypass (Lilly D2E, Hims, Amazon)

**Mechanism:** Manufacturer or digital pharmacy sells direct to employer, bypassing PBM and insurer.

Per [STAT News](https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/18/weight-loss-drugs-wegovy-zepbound-health-plans/): HCA dropped Wegovy/Zepbound coverage, directing to manufacturer D2C at $200-$450.

Lilly launching direct-to-employer model early 2026:
- Dedicated pharmacy network for cost tracking
- Third-party lifestyle support integration
- Flexibility around benefit design

**WriteWise fit:** Potential complement — could offer PMPM guarantee on residual (non-GLP-1) Rx spend while employer uses D2E for GLP-1s. Not currently pursuing.

### Model 4: Integrated Rx Stop-Loss

**Mechanism:** Extend stop-loss from medical to pharmacy, with specialty focus on high-cost cohorts like GLP-1 users.

Per [PBMI 2025](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/stop-loss-and-the-surprise-claim-pbmi-2025): *"We're starting to get questions about how stop-loss insurance can be used for pharmacy, where historically stop-loss covered medical because pharmacy was a smaller component."*

**WriteWise positioning:** RxProtect is Rx-only stop-loss with 0% loss ratio (no claims breached attachment). Per Oct 2025 board deck [[writewise-board-presentation_oct-2025-43d389c9.md]]:
- 100% gross margin on stop-loss premiums
- Expanding from 2,400 to 7,800 employees covered
- Combined ratio: 25%

This is WriteWise's differentiated moat. Nobody else offers standalone Rx stop-loss with AI-driven underwriting.

## Market Context: Why This Matters Now

### Employer Pain is Acute

- [Mercer 2026 Survey](https://www.mercer.com/en-us/insights/us-health-news/glp-1-considerations-for-2026-your-questions-answered/): 77% of large employers say managing GLP-1 costs is "extremely or very important"
- PMPM costs: $1.43 (2019) → $24.59 (2024) — 77% CAGR [[2026-employer-health-care-strategy-survey]]
- 64% of employers still don't cover GLP-1s for weight loss — massive gap

### PBM Adaptation is Fast

- Cigna EncircleRx: 9M enrollees in 18 months
- [Express Scripts EnReachRx](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/cigna-bucks-medical-cost-trend-posts-13b-q1-profit): pharmacy network optimization + fraud detection
- CVS dropped Zepbound July 2025 — forcing manufacturer concessions

### Regulatory Tailwinds

- Medicare GLP-1 coverage launching H2 2026 via BALANCE Model [[2025-12-24-CMS Launches Voluntary Model]]
- Trump MFN: Ozempic $1,000→$350
- Oral GLP-1 approved Dec 2025 at $149/month — channel disruption accelerating

## WriteWise Strategic Gaps

### What WriteWise Does Well

1. **PMPM Guarantee underwriting** — 86M+ historical claims, 4% loss ratio, PBM bid auctions
2. **Rx-only stop-loss (RxProtect)** — 0% loss ratio, 100% gross margin, unique in market
3. **GLP-1 clinical steerage** — Tirzepatide step therapy, quarterly variance scans, formulary rules

### Strategic Gaps

| Opportunity | WriteWise Position | Gap |
|-------------|-------------------|-----|
| Cooperative purchasing (Andel model) | None | Not addressable without business model change |
| D2E bypass integration | None | Could offer guarantee on residual Rx alongside D2E GLP-1 |
| GLP-1-specific product | General Rx | Could launch standalone GLP-1 carve-out as entry wedge |
| Stop-loss capacity expansion | Constrained | RxProtect at 0% loss ratio suggests room to expand aggressively |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Launch standalone GLP-1 guarantee** — Use as entry wedge for employers not ready for full PMPM suite. Compete directly with EncircleRx on price and clinical outcomes.

2. **Partner with D2E players** — Offer PMPM guarantee on non-GLP-1 Rx spend while employers use Lilly D2E or Hims for weight loss drugs. Capture the residual.

3. **Expand RxProtect aggressively** — 0% loss ratio and 25% combined ratio means capacity to lower attachment points and grow premium volume. GLP-1 cohorts are high-cost but predictable.

4. **Develop oral GLP-1 scenario planning** — If orals go mail-order tier (not specialty), volatility drops. Adjust underwriting assumptions and communicate to prospects.

---

## Bull Case

- WriteWise's underwriting advantage compounds as GLP-1 volatility increases
- RxProtect captures pharmacy stop-loss market before incumbents adapt
- Cigna's EncircleRx hits capacity constraints, creating overflow demand
- Oral GLP-1s stabilize costs, making PMPM guarantees easier to price

## Bear Case

- Cigna's 9M-enrollee head start creates winner-take-most dynamics
- Manufacturers consolidate around D2E, making PBM-adjacent models obsolete
- Employer inertia keeps 64% non-coverage rate — market doesn't materialize
- RxProtect loss ratios normalize as competitors enter with better pricing
