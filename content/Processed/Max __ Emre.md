### Maksim Background & Problem Discovery

- Strong hypothesis developed over last 3-4 months through comprehensive research
- Personal catalyst: grandparents’ health deteriorating, father struggling as primary caregiver
	- SNAP benefits cut due to IT error at Massachusetts agency
	- Highlighted need for dedicated advocate/navigator
- 10+ years tech experience: Palantir → business school → 6 years healthcare VC-backed startups
	- Zeus (API platform), Parenting (full care delivery, Medicaid focus)
	- Laid off from Tomorrow Health summer 2024, created opportunity to start company

### DhanaCare Market Opportunity

- Target: family caregivers supporting older adults at home
- Core problem: growing aging population + workforce shortage + funding cuts to support programs
- Market size: ~10M people on Medicaid receiving long-term services and supports (LTSS)
	- Represents 40% of total Medicaid expenditures despite being small population segment
- Private long-term care insurance market essentially non-existent
- Goal: avoid institutional placement and hospitalizations through family caregiver empowerment

### Two Potential Go-to-Market Pathways

- Option A - Direct-to-Consumer SaaS:
	- AI software for family caregivers
	- Integration with health records and provider portals
	- Features: care plan understanding, health literacy, Medicaid payment navigation
	- Route to payers: validation study → white paper → health plan sales
- Option B - Agency Operating System:
	- Software for home care agencies to utilize family caregivers
	- Solves agency workforce shortage (primary pain point)
	- Benefits: revenue capture, reduced turnover (family won’t leave), administrative burden reduction
	- Reference models: Abacare and Givers (became agencies themselves, more capital intensive)

### Healthcare Market Dynamics Discussion

- Health plans have best incentive alignment, especially Medicaid LTSS vertical
- Challenge: health plans don’t take bets on unproven solutions
- Policy tailwinds: some states allow billing 120 hours/week for parent caregivers
- Opportunity to focus on 3-5 states rather than national rollout initially

### TAM and Fundability Concerns

- Healthcare = thousands of individual markets, each low single-digit billions TAM
- Initial market segment approaching $1B TAM with high gross margins
- Path to venture scale requires stacking adjacent markets over time
- Tension between taking focused approach vs. larger swing at bigger market upfront

### Next Steps

- Maksim continuing to refine hypothesis and prototype testing
- Both attending Box Group breakfast Wednesday
- Follow-up call planned for later next week
