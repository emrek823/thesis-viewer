President Donald Trump made good on his campaign promises to kick off his second term in office with a tidal wave of executive orders.

Either in front of cheering supporters at a Monday evening rally or later that night in the Oval Office, Trump signed dozens of executive orders and outlined other presidential actions spanning large swaths of the federal government. This included an executive order [revoking 78 executive actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/) taken by the Biden administration, plus other steps to review rulemaking and other actions taken during the waning days of Joe Biden’s presidency.

Additional orders signed by Trump outline ideological changes to how executive agencies will craft regulations and view artificial intelligence or reassess the U.S.’ role in global agreements. Other changes weren’t explicitly laid out in the president’s orders but are reflected in materials no longer available on government websites.

While subsequent days have continued the flow of policy decisions, reports have also begun to surface about how external and internal directives are affecting government agencies' longstanding norms.  Here’s a breakdown of the changes affecting healthcare agencies, the industry and public health during Trump's first week. *(**Editor’s note**: this story has been, and will continue to be, updated.)*

### Artificial Intelligence guardrails removed

Among Trump's immediate moves was to pull Biden's “Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,”[a sweeping 2023 directive](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/biden-sign-sweeping-executive-order-pursuing-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-ai) outlining the federal government’s stance on “responsible” AI.

The order sought to establish practices across multiple agencies, including the HHS, such as safety testing prior to public release, algorithm bias, nondiscrimination, safeguards on the use of individuals’ data during large-scale model training and mitigation of automation’s impact on workforces.

Its guidelines and principles laid out a road map for the strategic plan on AI released by the HHS[on Jan. 10](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/hhs-new-ai-strategic-plan-promises-increased-guidance-and-funding), as well as instructions for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to build a U.S. AI Safety Institute as a home for technical guidance in future regulatory efforts.

A new order signed on Jan. 23, "Removing Barriers to American AI Innovation," outlined Trump's view that the Biden order hindered innovation and imposed "onerous and unnecessary government control over the development of AI." Those requirements, per the Trump White House, would have hamstrung the private sector.

"American development of AI systems must be free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas," the Trump administration wrote in a fact sheet describing the order.

The new order calls for another AI Action Plan "to sustain and enhance America's AI dominance," which would be developed by the assistant to the president for science and technology, the Assistant to the President for Science & Technology, the White House AI & Crypto Czar, and the National Security Advisor.

Additionally, it will see the Office of Management and Budget revise and reissue its memoranda to federal agencies on the acquisition and governance of AI "to ensure that harmful barriers to America's AI leadership are eliminated."

Trump promoted his administration's support for AI development on his second day in office [during an event highlighting](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41) an up to $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. Also still in place is a week-old Biden order that aimed to streamline the building of large-scale data centers and infrastructure within the U.S.

### Immigration enforcement, "sensitive location" policy rescinded

Trump marked his return to the White House with a new national emergency declaration that suspends refugee admissions and paves the way for what he has described as the "largest deportation operation" in U.S. history.

The administration, on Tuesday, amplified the effort with [the end of a long-standing policy](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/01/21/statement-dhs-spokesperson-directives-expanding-law-enforcement-and-ending-abuse) not to arrest individuals without legal status who are in or near "sensitive locations" such as schools, places of worship, the site of a religious event and hospitals.

The change has forced hospitals and healthcare workers to decide whether to comply with immigration enforcement or restrict access to their patients and their information to those with a warrant.

However, many hospitals, practitioners and healthcare groups say they have no plans to turn away patients needing care due to their immigration status. Some fear that federal agents' disruptions could cause patients to skip needed medical care.

Providers are receiving differing messages on the issue depending on their state government. Red states such as Texas and Florida have largely supported the president's immigration stance and have policies on the books that require healthcare providers to collect information on patients' legal status. Blue state leaders have gone the other direction and have released recommendations against such practices while stressing that providers are under no legal obligation to assist with an arrest.

### Regulatory freeze slows HHS

The Trump administration has ordered a governmentwide regulatory freeze that will halt progress on healthcare regulations.

The freeze stops the rulemaking process in its tracks and prevents the new Trump administration from issuing new rules for 60 days.

In that time, the new Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) leadership will decide which Biden-era regulations it wants to toss, which it will let stand and which it wants to change.

The first Trump administration and the Biden administration instated regulatory freezes on the first days of their terms in 2017 and 2021, respectively.

“The administration gets in and understands the regulatory landscape of where things are and can put out their own kind of stamp on regulatory policies,” Jeff Davis, director of health policy at McDermott+, said.

Trump’s HHS will review regulations that were proposed, but not finalized, by the Biden administration, such as the proposed updates to the [HIPAA Security Rule](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/hhs-proposes-cybersecurity-updates-healthcare-organizations) and [the proposed rule for prescribing controlled substances via telehealth](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/dea-proposes-registry-system-telehealth-rx-heightened-scrutiny-telehealth-platforms). Rules that were finalized by Biden but are not yet effective are also stalled for 60 days.

The freeze will give the Trump administration time to determine its regulatory priorities and how they differ from Biden’s. Also, the 60-day freeze gives the administration time to get through the confirmation process for agency officials.

Of note, Trump’s nominee for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has not yet been scheduled to appear in front of the Senate. The Washington Post reported that the scheduling of the confirmation hearing has been delayed because the Senate is still rifling through RFK Jr.’s financial disclosures. Dorothy Fink, M.D., has been appointed to serve as acting HHS secretary in the meantime.

Davis said it’s likely that the Trump team will throw out Biden’s proposed staffing mandate for skilled nursing facilities and the proposed updates to Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug programs.

In the last weeks of Biden’s term, his administration proposed several rules, even though the administration knew they could not be finalized and would likely be subject to a regulatory freeze.

“They're not starting from scratch, so to speak,” Davis said. “They have to kind of deal with some of the proposed rules … and put their own spin on them or rescind them. But they have to deal with them in some capacity.”

The Trump administration has several other tools at its disposal to void Biden-era healthcare regulations. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to more easily invalidate regulations finalized after Aug. 16, 2024. The new administration could also promulgate new rulemaking that replaces a Biden regulation and prevents the agency from proposing a similar rule.

The new administration could also choose to not enforce Biden-era rules or could challenge rules in court. One of the many Biden executive orders that Trump rescinded on day one was his 2023 order to modernize the regulatory review process.

### HHS communications go dark, scientific meetings cancelled

Trump's directive to slow down agency action extends beyond regulatory rulemaking. As reported by the Washington Post and later confirmed by other outlets, HHS was ordered to pause all public communications and public appearances "that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health."

Exceptions are permitted on a case-by-case basis if "reviewed and approved by a Presidential appointee, as was presumably the case for [an FDA safety warning](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-adds-boxed-warning-about-rare-serious-allergic-reaction-called-anaphylaxis-multiple-sclerosis?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) regarding a multiple sclerosis medicine. However, resources from the department such as the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a weekly public health publication that has run without break since 1960, have been put on hold.

"Every day this vital publication is delayed, doctors, nurses, hospitals, local health departments and first responders are behind the information curve and less prepared to protect the health of all Americans," former CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., wrote on X.

The freeze has also led to the cancellation of scientific meetings and gatherings scheduled for the coming days, such as a Presidential Advisory Council meeting on antibiotic resistance, a National Vaccine Advisory Committee panel and others NIH meetings intended to review applications for federal fellowships and grants.

Former government health officials and other experts have [told](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/22/nx-s1-5270866/hhs-cdc-health-communications-trump) [press](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/health/trump-freeze-health-agency-communications-cancellation-scientific-meetings/6119922/) that some form of initial pause and review is not unheard of for a new administration, although this week's directive appears more substantial and lasting than the norm and could bring public health repercussions.

The pause is in effect through Feb. 1, according to an internal memo sent to staff.

"The President's appointees intend to review documents and communications expeditiously and return to a more regular process as soon as possible," it reads.

### HHS OIG Grimm fired by Trump

In a move that sent shockwaves around the federal government, Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general Jan. 24, reported numerous news outlets. Among those impacted is Inspector General Christi Grimm, head of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for HHS, confirmed Fierce Healthcare.

HHS declined to offer additional information. It’s unclear exactly why she was fired. Grimm was[fired](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/02/849642036/trump-moves-to-replace-watchdog-who-reported-medical-shortages) in a similar fashion by Trump in May 2020 after the office published a report on challenges hospitals faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump publicly denied the accuracy of the report.

Inspector generals are staffed within federal agencies to conduct non-partisan investigations, aiming to bolster transparency and stop fraud and abuse. In the last six months alone, HHS OIG released reports on[remote patient monitoring](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/hhs-watchdog-calls-out-rpm-fraud-stakeholders-say-oig-doesnt-understand-codes),[opioid use disorder](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/hhs-finds-gaps-opioid-treatment-medicare-medicaid-enrollees) services,[maternal health](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/exclusive-medicaid-insurers-can-do-more-improve-maternal-health-access-hhs-report-says) in managed care, Medicare Advantage[upcoding](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/medicare-advantage-plans-received-billions-medicare-home-visits-feds-are-skeptical) through health risk assessments and[overpayments](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/oig-calls-humana-aetna-subsidiary-repay-millions-ma-overpayments) to private insurers.

Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, said the firings violate the law and undermine democracy.

The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, an independent entity within the executive branch representing these officers, agreed the action taken by Trump was illegal. A president must notify Congress 30 days ahead of firing an inspector general with sufficient rationale, the group said in a[statement](https://www.ignet.gov/sites/default/files/files/CIGIE%20Statement%20--%201_25_2025.pdf) (PDF).

Republicans may be miffed as well. Earlier this month, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, announced she was launching a bipartisan Inspector General Caucus to work with office heads to identify waste, fraud and abuse, a goal that is seemingly aligned with the mission of the Department of Gov
