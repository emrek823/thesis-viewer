### SMB Investment Decision

- Partial validation from Yan Lakun Ami raise (~$500M at $3.5B valuation)
	- Yann LeCun doubling down on JEPA approach
- Key outstanding risks remain:
- Target ownership: 12% ideal, 14% would be exceptional
	- Concentrated position strategy for LP expectations
	- Potential math: If they sign one Noetic-style deal → $1B valuation
	- Upside scenario: 50% attribution on 5 drugs vs Prometheus 100% attribution on 1 drug for $10B
- Downside protection: Strong team/data for potential acqui-hire scenario

### Investment Strategy & Approach

- Framework for Kevin conversation:
- Valuation signaling concerns addressed - no downstream anchoring risk with <20% dilution target
- Backup scenario: Join GV-led $10-15M round at higher valuation if needed
- Timing advantages: Current AI tailwinds + Kevin’s federated pharma model validation

### This Week Priorities

- Kevin call Wednesday - assess real-time market feedback
- Call Evan Mango for confirmatory information pre-Kevin meeting
- JPM Healthcare Conference networking focus
	- Source intel on portfolio companies (Hermes, Solstice)
	- Expand deal flow through founder/product lead outreach
- Solstice deck review before meeting
- Aaron Shapiro call moved to next week
