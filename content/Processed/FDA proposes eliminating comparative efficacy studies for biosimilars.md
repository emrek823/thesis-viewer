# FDA Proposes Eliminating Comparative Efficacy Studies for Biosimilars

On October 29, 2025, FDA announced action to make biosimilar development faster and less costly.

## New Draft Guidance

"Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product: Updated Recommendations for Assessing the Need for Comparative Efficacy Studies"

Supersedes 2015 guidance with evolved scientific approach.

## Key Change

Comparative efficacy studies (CES) **may not be necessary** when:
1. Products manufactured from clonal cell lines, highly purified, well-characterized analytically
2. Relationship between quality attributes and clinical efficacy is understood
3. Human pharmacokinetic similarity study is feasible and clinically relevant

## Rationale

- Advanced analytical technologies detect minor protein differences more precisely than clinical trials
- Well-conducted comparative analytical assessment (CAA) is more sensitive than CES
- CES typically requires 1-3 years and costs **$24 million on average**
- CES has low sensitivity compared to analytical assessments

## Expected Impact

- Reduces development cost by **$100-300 million per program**
- Shortens development timelines by several years
- Accelerates biosimilar entry → more competition → lower drug prices

## Market Context

- Biologics: 5% of prescriptions but 51% of drug spending (2024)
- US biosimilar market share below 20%
- 76 FDA-approved biosimilars to date
- Only ~10% of biologics losing patent protection have biosimilar in development
