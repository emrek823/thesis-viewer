### Company overview

- Italic Health positioning as “Google sign-in layer across healthcare”
	- Identity and memory platform for healthcare ecosystem
	- Plaid-like infrastructure for healthcare data
- Core problem: Healthcare data fragmentation across platforms
	- Patients lose healthcare login details frequently
	- Providers lack comprehensive patient data for better care

### Data aggregation strategy

- Incremental data collection approach
	- Patient logs into Function Health using Italic → next time logs into Hims using Italic → builds network effect
	- Similar to Google sign-in accumulation across websites over time
- Patient-consented data sharing only
- AI layer to digest aggregated information
	- Quick queries like “Patient feeling exhausted - what’s changed?”
	- Cross-reference medication refills, sleep data, step counts, lab results

### Go-to-market approach

- Target 30 major telehealth companies first
- Leverage existing relationships at LabCorp and Quest
	- 115M patients each per year at both labs
	- Every account creation activates a patient in network
- Two integration methods:
	- Single sign-on at authentication
	- Link existing accounts to aggregate data
- Bottom-up adoption: patients become “de facto sales reps”

### Value propositions

- Conversion improvement for digital health companies
	- Function Health example: spending $12M/month on advertising with 50% patient drop-off
- Enhanced patient data for providers
	- Historical labs, wearable data, medication adherence, adverse effects
- Simplified patient experience
	- One login across healthcare platforms
	- Consolidated health data access

### Fundraising status

- Seed round: $3-5M target
	- $3M: Build company with Series A runway
	- $5M: Build, launch, and sign first contracts
- Three commitments already secured since starting meetings last week
- Lead investor selection expected within 1-2 weeks
- Looking for hands-on investors with healthcare experience and network
- Kyle available for in-person meetings: Austin next week, then New York
