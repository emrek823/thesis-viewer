## Slide 2: Company Update - Highlights

**RIGHT SI+E**

**Health Plan Sales**
*   We now have 6 FFS and 1 case rate deals signed, 2 case rates agreed to now in amendment contracting, and 13 deals in active negotiations.up from 8 in Q4:22.
*   Regional or state plan CEOs are involved in most conversations, an intentional outcome as we are selling to the P&L owner.
*   The case rate vs VBC approach strategy is working.
*   We've added Brian Shipp to our sales consultants, a NVP intro and recently retired regional CEO from Elevance, and placed the current Elevance team in GA. He'll be rewarded when (and he's got a 3 month time fuse) we get a case rate closed with Elevance in GA.
*   Negotiating FFS contracts at standard rates has continues to be a smooth, routine process.

**EMS/Fire Implementation and Expansion**
*   We added evening hours to our M-F shifts (6pmCT - 10pmCT) to harvest calls from evening shift EMS crews. The incremental navigators and physician hour investment paid off, as we captured the predicted additional call volume.
*   We implemented San Antonio Fire Department, starting first straight out of dispatch (not from EMS in the field). We got 50 calls week 1. SAFD management is very pleased, as is the SAFD Medical Director. This is a high profile Fire Dept, and so a big win for RightSite.
*   Word of mouth continues in GA and now in TX with EMS management ("choosers").
*   At the end of Q3, Grady finally produced an MOU that, once signed, will open up call volume from their dispatch center. Big potential number of calls.
*   Change management at the EMS Crew level (“users”) is working. This underscores the need for us to build a well run in-field account management program as we scale. Not new news, just more evidence that this is the right path.
*   Implementations of incremental EMS agencies in Atlanta have been smooth.
*   Jacksonville Fire and Rescue produced a trickle of calls, but is stalled until the mayor announces the new fire chief. I expect a mid-Q4 relaunch.

**Operations**
*   Navigators+MDs went from 5 to 30 calls over the course of the quarter. This was a massive step up operationally, and the team was a rock and rallied like you would expect in a high-performance culture. With volume at these levels, we are now workflow mapping the entire process in search of platform and workflow efficiencies, which is a priority for Q4.
*   The RightSite Connect platform remains stable and effective with its supporting team of 3 engineers.
*   We underperformed in standing up credentialing and revenue cycle. Many of the issues have now been rectified, and Q4 will see steady claims submission and payment posting.

**Challenges**
*   Continuing to improve our account management with EMS
*   Continuing to push on glacial pace of health plan contracting
*   Office space is a big problem (non-functioning elevators on 8th floor space) and we are moving asap. Big distraction.
*   Keeping a careful eye on the burn rate as we accelerate activity and continue to make a few well-placed small bets (for example, hire a few off budget navigators to extend evening hours to see if we can capture more volume - we did hire more and we did capture more volume).

| 3) MSO and Revenue Cycle are operational and able to scale | ![Partial Green Circle] Credentialing and revenue cycle basics are now in place, but this took us too long) to stand up (will explain details if interested). The bones are now in place, and in Q4 we will have a credentialing and rev cycle foundation in place. We are now ., but is now submitting claims. Partial green circle = it took us too long to do this. |
| 4) Prepare RightSite for Series A funding              | ![Green Circle] Unit call cost model built. Draft community EBITDA model built. Ready to sit with NVP/8VC and refine model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

1. Includes i) quarterly + annual costs adjusted for months and ii) interest income

### MD&A – Month-to-Month Variance
1.  Aug-23 m/m spend was flat. The variance in Other Operating spend was due to the second payment ($32K) to Strata Technology for hospital cost accounting data
2.  Sep-23 expected to be in line w/ Jul/Aug-23
3.  Based on an estimate of the future burn and adjusted cash balance at EOP Sep-23, RightSite projects ~ 6 months of cash runway assuming zero revenue

### MD&A – Burn
The estimated monthly steady state burn of $435K increased by $42K due to:
1.  6 new navigators (2 hired as of today), increased physician time, and incremental patient care expenses due to extended hours and San Antonio expansion (see p. 9)
2.  Mitigants include reduction to marketing spend and Atlanta legal partner

## Slide 6: KPI Highlights

**RIGHT SI+E**

We navigated our 1,000th case this month - an important signal of growing operational reliability in anticipation of scaling. September volume was 200% above July, and 55% above August.
KPIs all remain green except for #6, "Time to MD on Screen,” the time from the initial EMS call to the MD talking to the patient. This isn't an experience problem as much as an efficiency opportunity.

### As of 9/30/23 RightSite KPIs

| Category  | KPI                                           | Since Inception | July 2023 | Aug 2023 | Sept 2023 | Goal      |

## Slide 10: Call Volume - Focus on Sept

**RIGHT SI+E**

September had important call volume “firsts.” One new source was our decision to staff up and add extended hours, from 7pm - 10pm ct M-F. The second source was a new EMS client, San Antonio Fire, that launched with calls coming only from dispatch (no calls yet from the field as of now).

## Slide 11: Sales - Payors 1/2

**RIGHT SI+E**

During Q3, we signed 1 FFS contract and have another agreed to and in contracting. We have 2 case rate contracts agreed to and in contracting (Humana-GA & BCBS-FL). Closed deals stand at 6 FFS and 1 case rate. The pipeline has 13 in ‘active negotiation' (5 FFS, 8 case rate). Of note, the new CMS rule starting Jan 2024 creates tailwind for us with payers (see last bullet point).

### What Happened

**Payor Specific Updates**
*   Humana-GA - FFS contract signed, agreement reached on case rate - contract documents in process
*   Florida Blue - Agreement reached on FFS and case rate - contract documents in process
*   CareSource-GA - agreement to contract case rate - negotiating rates
*   Aetna Corporate - evaluating case rates at a system level which will be carried into the states
*   Centene-GA/FL - now at Region President level in pursuing case rate in GA and FL
*   Aetna Better Health-VA - interested in implementing soon (200k+ lives) - awaiting system level analysis (see “Aetna Corporate” bullet above
*   BlueCross Complete-MI - Interested in moving forward - meeting next week to determine next steps
*   Cigna continued active interest in the Proactive Outreach Service (PMPM revenue); targeting 4th quarter decision. Pushing for FFS and case rate agreement in GA now
*   Blue Cross Kansas City - Evaluating RightSite against other ED diversion programs - targeting a January 2024 launch
*   Elevance - GA - Meeting with Elevance and Amerigroup leadership next week

**Other Updates**
*   Emcara, an attributed provider group, is live. They are owned by FloridaBlue. Implementing Emcara is preparing us to implement and build navigation processes with any attributed provider, like what we anticipate from Humana-FL.
*   CMS will enforce a new rule starting Jan ‘24, requiring MA plans to align with traditional Medicare's inpatient claims management. This will reduce MA plans' ability to down code or deny inpatient stays, ultimately increasing the cost of avoidable ED admissions and supporting RightSite's value in reducing (re)admissions. This is a tailwind for MA sales cycle speed, and case rate levels.

## Slide 12: Sales - Payors 2/2

**RIGHT SI+E**

### What's Next
*   Q4 FFS goal = 80% of FFS contracts with plans active in each community. That translates to +3 in GA, +5 in FL and +6 in TX
*   Q4 Case Rate goal: greater than 4 in GA, 2 in FL, 2 in TX
*   Complete FFS and Case Rate contracting process with Centene, CareSource and Cigna
*   Pursue contracts in the San Antonio market - emphasis on Centene, Humana and Molina
*   Finalize product/process definition and pricing of this service of the Proactive Outreach Service
*   We are in the early stage an opportunity to take over Ready Responder's footprint in Las Vegas and Reno
*   Complete data analysis with Meritain (Aetna owned TPA for self insured groups ) for four commercial clients in Jacksonville, FL
*   BayCare negotiations continue - Tampa. Most internal BayCare stakeholders have agreed to move forward
*   Aetna Better Health FL interested when we enter Tampa
*   National Association of Medicaid Directors Conference 10/1-3
*   Medicaid Health Plan of America Conference 10/18-20

### Challenges
*   Payor sense of urgency
*   Serious inquiries/interest outside of initial targeted GA, FL, TX markets. ABH-VA likely to push for Q4:23, and BCBS-MI and BCBS-KC likely to push for H1:24
*   Health plans' belief in their managed care processes mitigate IP and OBS stay for avoidable ED visits (they don't)
*   While we continue to find new ways into United, traction remains a challenge.

## Slide 14: Sales - Government Relations

**RIGHT SI+E**

### What Happened
*   Ted Koutsoubas, Advisory Board and Gov Relations SME – weekly internal meetings
*   National Association of Medicaid Directors (NAMD) – RightSite sponsor at the October 1-3rd annual meeting with 300 attendees, including Payors. Michael, Cindy and Mike Marrah (RightSite Advisory Board member and former-Centene IlliniCare CEO) attended and made multiple contacts.
*   Medicaid Health Plans of America (MHPA) – RightSite sponsor for the Annual October 18-20th meeting in DC. Jamo, Michael, Cindy and Mike Marrah will be attending.
*   Oct 11th meeting with GA DCH Director and team to update them RightSite activities and ask for support with GA Medicaid, both FFS and Managed Payors.

### What's Next
*   Q4's goal is to advance RightSite's awareness with State officials in GA, FL, and TX and maybe VA.
*   Medicaid Data – Institute for Medicaid Innovation proving to be a challenge to get them to engage. Strategy will be to revisit our data request with them as we increase our call volume and have a large dataset to share.

### Challenges
*   We have generated many GR conversations in various stages. We need to focus on those that can accelerate our near-term priorities.
*   Our GR efforts are not budgeted, but we will continue to be thoughtful about where we spend our money here
*   Takes time

### On Hold
*   Florida Partners – good conversation with FL ACHA President, who suggests we get a FFS Pilot. When the State does a Pilot, payors tend to flock to what the State is evaluating. We are having an early conversation about JAX being that Pilot location. Proposed fee of $100,000 in August 2023–will revisit at a later time.

*   2 Atlanta Area EMS agencies in sales or approval process
    *   Douglas County Fire EMS MOU agreement approved on Oct 4th. Expecting both field and dispatch calls 4Q:23. Call volume estimate ~4k/yr calls
    *   Clayton County Fire EMS MOU negotiation underway. (Q4 expectations for Alpharetta Fire, Sandy Springs, Marietta Fire, Dekalb Fire Rescue and Gwinnett County Fire, which is the largest EMS volume in Atlanta Metro.
**Greater Georgia**
*   Chatham Emergency Services (transporting service outside of Savannah)
*   Strong interest in RightSite's service in rural GA
**Florida**
*   Pausing on expansion in NE FL until JFRD is stable
**Texas**
*   San Antonio Fire Department (SAFD) activated 9/25, starting with dispatch (“PSAP”). Highly successful launch (see p. 9)
*   Exploratory call with Acadian was a dead end after their failed attempt to launch an ET3 program
**Arizona / Virginia**
*   We suspended EMS sales time in these markets for now to focus on GA, FL, TX

### What's Next

**Georgia Expansion**
*   Awaiting Grady EMS MOU to start taking calls from PSAP/Dispatch for ATL (we received the MOU 10/4)
*   Close/activate Douglas County EMS, Alpharetta Fire, Clayton County Fire, Marietta Fire, Dekalb Fire Rescue & Sandy Springs
*   Initiate discussions with Gwinnett County Fire (largest EMS volume in Atlanta Metro) & Roswell
**Florida Expansion**
*   Began planning NE and central FL expansion
**Texas**
*   SAFD adds volume from Mobile Integrated Health unit (“MIH”), which includes hospice and high utilizer populations that includes an existing relationship with Molina.
*   EMS Expansion geographically around SAFD through an EMS consortium called STRAC

## Slide 16: Sales - Hospitals

**RIGHT SI+E**

BayCare/Tampa conversations continue with entire leadership team. We should have resolution from them during Q4 about their willingness to partner with RightSite as we enter Tampa - either with them, or through EMS.

## Slide 17: Marketing

**RIGHT SI+E**

### What Happened
*   New website launched ahead of NAMD and MHPA meetings in October. Messaging and value prop are getting cleaner. Check it out: website link [here](https://www.rightsitehealth.com/).
*   Social media scheduled publishing now live on Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn

### What's Next
*   Continued marcomm

### Challenges
*   Controlling the trade-off marketing decisions between what is desirable and achievable given our limited cycles, budget and no formal lead for marketing needs.
*   There is an opportunity to increase EMS medic adoption (behavior change) through social media and we aren't doing that yet

## Slide 19: Operations - Georgia (ATL)

**RIGHT SI+E**

### What Happened

**Implementations**
*   Continued expansion into South Fulton (southern Atlanta MSA) through our warm partnership with Grady EMS with a go-live in the City of Morrow (transporting Fire Department)

**EMS Account Management**
*   Launched "EMS clinical liaison” to experiment with EMS training and engagement. Think of a “cath lab rep” who used to work in a cath lab. This is a firefighter / paramedic training/selling firefighters and paramedics.
*   Refining EMS implementation and post-go-live account management plan, including critical change management process for front-line EMS adoption; EMS Leadership is actively engaged and willing to partner to drive change.
*   Consistent delivery of EMS partner performance reporting & materials to help drive EMS front-line adoption & accountability.
*   2 contracts submitted for county commissioner approval in Clayton & Douglas Counties.
*   Increasing trend of avg weekly and monthly calls per day.
*   Launched first RightSite GA EMS approved continuing education credit course in partnership with Grady EMS.
*   Riding with Grady in the field, we identified barriers to activating RightSite. As a result, we simplified the message and timing for EMS clinicians to connect patients with an ER doctor.

### What's Next

**Implementations**
*   Douglas County - Transporting Fire Service + e911 dispatch
*   Clayton County - Transporting Fire Service
*   GA expansion in N.Fulton County (Alpharetta Fire & others)
*   Grady EMS - Nurseline, MIH and 911 Dispatch integration

**Extending relationship with Grady Hospital**
*   Opportunity to take calls directly from their 911 dispatch and 911 nurse line in Q4, which will add more volume on top of on-scene EMS calls.
*   Expansion double avg daily call volume over the next 60 days through new program implementations.
*   Access to additional data to identify resistant personas and increase activations among infrequent and first-time RightSite users.

### Challenges
*   Change management strategies for EMS engagement continue to be a learning curve. Making progress is about focusing on the 'users,' not the 'choosers' - who show strong support and cooperation.
*   Slow decision making within government agencies.
*   Grady MOU process - as we get deeper into the relationship contracting & approval processes slow down speed to implement outside of the traditional EMS model.

## Slide 20: Operations - Texas (SAT)

**RIGHT SI+E**

San Antonio FD was a 6 week cycle, from intro sales call to workflow mapping to go-live. First EMS agency to launch dispatch first, not field. Highly successful first week (50 calls first week) and very happy client. They are a strong voice in Texas for EMS.

### What Happened

**Implementations**
*   Several discovery meetings with SAFD leadership to outline the workflows for clinical dispatch PSAP calls for RightSite
*   54 SAFD Clinical Dispatch Paramedics trained in four days-Sept 19-22
*   Executed BAA and PSA from CoSA and SAFD signed Sept 25th
*   Activation on Sept 25th – 50 Dispatch calls in 1st week!

**EMS Account Management**
*   Daily Calls completed with SAFD stakeholders during the first week to continue refining the process and communicating consistently

### What's Next

**Implementations**
*   SAFD MIH Discovery on Sept 25th with key stakeholders to begin mapping out current processes for other Mobile Integrated Health existing lines of business with Acute Care Stations, High Utilizers and Hospice Care
*   Weekly check-in calls with Dispatch stakeholders to continue engagement and growth

### Challenges
*   Dispatch calls are very different from having EMS live with the patient in the field prior to the call. The ability to assess the patient can be limited, and the Navigation and Physician teams have to be prepared for less information initially
*   The overall response to our partnership with SAFD is overwhelmingly positive. While this is a great start, it also causes a lot of push from them to continue expansion before we're ready

## Slide 21: Operations - Florida (JAX)

**RIGHT SI+E**

Jacksonville's progress is on hold until the new mayor appoints the JFRD Fire Chief. Once leadership is established, we anticipate a relaunch within 45 days, supported by the mayor's endorsement of RightSite.

### What Happened

**Implementations**
*   4 JFRD stations live since 8/7 (4 calls till date; 50% patients with non-ER outcome)
*   Emcara Health (3 counties around Jacksonville with 659 enrolled members). Emcara is a full-risk delegated provider wholly-owned by Florida Blue. Go Live date - 9/25
*   Contracting with Florida Blue (FFS & VBC/Case Rate) - agreement on rates, now in papering phase

**EMS Account Management**
*   Refining EMS implementation and post-go-live account management plan, including critical change management process for front-line EMS adoption

### What's Next

**Implementations**
*   FL expansion with additional JFRD stations
*   "RightSite Preferred UCC Provider” in JAX - CareSpot Urgent Care activation
*   Potential Clinical Liaison identified in JAX. Think of a "cath lab rep" who used to work in a cath lab. This is a retired Battalion Chief, highly respected with current responders training/selling firefighters and paramedics.

### Challenges
*   JAX political situation at the new mayor's office (Fire Chief not decided) is creating a delay in JFRD activation

## Slide 22: Navigation

**RIGHT SI+E**

### What Happened
*   Consistent higher volume has continued to test and iterate our navigation processes and efficiency. Team collaboration and culture are strong.
*   We onboarded two additional Navigators on September 25th. Training is effective enough now to have them take their first calls in 4 days. The current navigator count is 11.
*   We successfully expanded our hours on August 30th from 6am - 6pm CT M-F to 6am - 10pm CT M-F on with existing staff
*   We identified two internal candidates as Shift Leads after our expansion. Both accepted and are filling in the roles nicely.

### What's Next
*   The Advocacy Team of Navigators and Physicians will be conducting weekly Episode Reviews (similar to case reviews) to bolster our current QA process for calls.
*   We will be interviewing an additional 4 Navigators for the existing expanded hours model, one of which has accepted an offer and is scheduled to start October 16th.
*   We will begin discussions of expansion into weekends during Q4. Partners are providing data showing call potential we can consider for this next phase.

### Challenges
*   Call center-like environments are challenging to manage, as expected. Staffing, training and culture continue to be our focus.
*   Our current space is out of compliance with our lease requirements, We are hoping to move in the second week of October. (HVAC and elevator issues, among others).
*   Hiring within our rigorous values-based recruiting process.
*   Spike in volume causes both excitement and stress. Navigators are good about voicing their concern and we are working to keep morale high and issues addressed.

## Slide 23: Engineering

**RIGHT SI+E**

### What Happened
*   Updates to the intake workflow that included sending SMS text alerts to the RightSite physician when Telehealth starts
*   Ability for navigators to document the physician recommendation
*   Improved Contact Detail and Episode Detail
*   More integration with AdvancedMD EMR - synching clinical notes in the EHR
*   Integrated insurance discovery with pVerify as part of the intake workflow
*   Established insurance auditing workflow and procedures
*   Support for patient handoffs to attributed providers

### What's Next
*   Start design and implementation of EMS crew tracking
*   Deeper integration with AdvancedMD to support revenue cycle process, which will include synching insurances and more
*   Support for Dispatch calls
*   Start design and implementation of SDOH and related capabilities
*   Implement long-term reporting tool
*   Support for electronic patient consent
*   Support of EMS engagement and communication

### Challenges
*   Occasional poor connectivity on inbound EMS calls creates challenges for EMS and navigators. We need to identify specific connectivity issues and provide workarounds for them
*   Some challenges getting the management team to agree on product priorities and timeframes
*   Limited engineering resources require thoughtful and critical analysis of priorities

## Slide 24: RightSite Health Physicians

**RIGHT SI+E**

### What Happened
*   Dr. Joe Leong moved to a full-time schedule taking calls 4 days per week in 8-hour shifts
*   Working with Physician Practice Specialists (PPS) as outsourced partner for licensing and credentialing of the practice and the physicians
*   Dr. Jasmin Tanaja is our fourth physician, currently in onboarding (multi-state licensing + payor credentialing) and training
*   The physicians have started taking calls in the “Dispatch" model where the EMS Clinician is not physically present with the 911 caller - this is groundbreaking and innovative and could drive volume in new ways at larger scale

### What's Next
*   Deeper integration with AdvancedMD to support revenue cycle process, including insurance verification and patient coding (ICD-10 near term; CPT intermediate term)
*   Revenue cycle platform build for existing contracts in negotiation + government payors
*   Determine how to create invoicing for case-rate eligible episodes in AMD
*   Working w/ PPS to complete licensing and credentialing for 4 physicians in 4 states
*   The Physician and Navigation team will reorganize into an integrated health team to improve interoperability and assure the highest quality of clinical and SDOH outcomes
*   Looking at methods and expenses for “building a bench” of physicians that could quickly begin work when volume dictates future hires

### Challenges
*   Physician/entity credentialing and licensing administration is challenging to set up, establish, and administer
*   Lack of urgency for state departments that govern medical licensing and Medicaid licensure
*   Both of the above create a lag time from the decision to hire a new physician to when that physician would be credentialed in the states we are currently practicing in (GA, FL, TX)

## Slide 27: RightSite Foundation

**RIGHT SI+E**

The strategy for the RightSite Foundation is to provide partial cost coverage for RightSite services provided to uninsured patients.

### What Happened

*   Internal mechanics being set up (bank, insurance, website etc)
*   Creating initial descriptive content
*   Initiate community-level donor identification strategy (external vs. internal resource)
*   Begin recruiting process for post-Series A philanthropy lead

### Challenges
*   Likely to take 90-180 days for IRS approval
*   New Foundation with donor community
*   Need to find experienced foundation resources
