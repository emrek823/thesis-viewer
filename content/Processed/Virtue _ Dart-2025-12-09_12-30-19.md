### Revenue Status & 2026 Goals

- Seeking to close two deals at $300K+ each by year-end (would reach $2M+ ARR)
	- Hospice deal and CHAP (accreditation body) both at board approval stage
	- CHAP deal particularly valuable as partnership opportunity - recognized by all home health/hospice enterprises
- 2026 target: $10M ARR through expansion strategy
	- Clinical Data Analyst product entering development phase
	- Initial expansion revenue $50-100K off existing $200-300K contracts

### Commercial Strategy & New Hire

- Hired salesperson with $4-5M annual quota for home health/hospice market
	- Former operator of Homecare 100 conference (top 100 hospices/home health companies)
	- Extensive relationship network, planning to “burn the book” of contacts
	- Positioned as “hired gun” rather than strategic commercial leader
- Enterprise focus for post-acute market going forward
- Health systems: targeting one referenceable customer by Q1-Q2 2026

### Product & Engineering Moat Development

- Primary 2026 focus: building defensible product foundation
	- Current deployment timeline 6-12 weeks, need to reduce significantly
	- Moving from human-in-the-loop to automated solutions
	- Head of engineering role needed but not yet prioritized
- Clinical Data Analyst wedge strategy
	- Targeting CNO/CMO departments for patient safety and quality use cases
	- 80-90% of queries can convert to expansion products
	- Three active health system conversations: Beth Israel, Marin Health, Jackson Memorial

### Team Building Discussion

- Current approach: hiring specialists for specific functions vs building executive team
- Virtue perspective: top-performing companies prioritize A+ talent density early
	- Reference examples: SmartIX, Translucent success stories
	- Concern about “hired gun” approach vs strategic leadership
- Acknowledged need to collect data points on optimal hiring approach
- Recognition that new hire already attracting enterprise interest

### Next Steps

- Send proper revenue update with specific numbers
- Include team building strategy in upcoming investor memo
- Develop “dream team” organizational chart working backwards from goals
- Continue onboarding new salesperson (48-hour Austin visit)
