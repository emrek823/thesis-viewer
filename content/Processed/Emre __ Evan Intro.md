### Background and Announcements

- Virtue VC’s Fund 1 ($30M) fully deployed, final investment made last month
- Just activated Fund 2 ($55M) - managing over $100M across vehicles
- Invest $500K-$2.5M initially; can reinvest $5-10M in breakout winners
- Backed by hospitals, payers but maintain investment autonomy
- Strong Series A graduation rate (>50% vs 15-20% market average)
- First $1B+ exit from fourth investment

### Blake & Evan’s New Venture

- Blake sold previous company (CareSignal) 2.5 years ago
- Currently interim CEO at St. Louis based company
- Co-founded/bootstrapped non-medical home care company:
	- Built all technology in-house
	- $3M revenue, 120 employees
	- Pay $20/hr (20% above market), charge $35-37/hr

### Vision & Strategy

- Building world’s largest autonomous workforce in healthcare
- Sub-HIPAA, sub-clinical approach
- Initial rollout:
	- Tablet-based prototype for 120 home aides
	- Two core criteria:
		- Co-pilot must be “addictive” to client
		- Indispensable to home care aide
	- Proof of work system - elevates aides by documenting impact

### Technical Approach & Timeline

- Extension of aide - first 6 months:
	- Focus on voice interaction
	- Optimize when to talk/not talk
- Next phase - “DocRobot”:
	- Robot on wheels deployment
	- OEM functionality tailored to use cases
- Humanoids expected ready in 2 years
- Data generation strategy:
	- NVIDIA can generate synthetic data from seed data
	- DeepMind announced similar capabilities
	- Leveraging Amazon Astro for initial testing
	- Changed experiments where doctor virtually rolls up to client
	- Claims 50x improvement over traditional telemedicine

### Key Insights

- Cannot simply “plop a robot” in homes - will face rejection
- Need aide acceptance first to drive client adoption
- Presence is crucial - dramatic difference in real-world testing
- Building companion relationship, not just task automation
- Missing puzzle piece in home care that combines physical and software capabilities

### Next Steps & Funding

- Seeking 2-2.5 year runway
- Targeting $2-3M raise
- Preparing materials for investor discussions
- Team transitioning to full-time focus:
	- Blake sunsetting current role in 6 weeks to 3 months
	- Evan planning to step away from acquirer
