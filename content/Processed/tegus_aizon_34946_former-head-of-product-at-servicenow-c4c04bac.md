# Aizon - Former Head of Product at ServiceNow

## Interview conducted on June 03, 2022

## Topics
* Data Aggregation
* Biopharma
* MES Systems
* QMS Systems
* Biomanufacturing
* Partnerships
* Digital transformation
* Manufacturing Software

## Summary
The Tegus Client consults with the Former Head of Product at ServiceNow to gain insight into the role of existing manufacturing software in the biopharma space, specifically in terms of data aggregation and MES systems. The expert mentions partnerships with companies like Aizon and Tulip, as well as more traditional MES companies like Plex and Infor. They discuss the ease of sale for a GxP-compliant data aggregation analytics platform, with start-ups and companies with new drugs or manufacturing processes being more likely to adopt an out-of-the-box solution. The Former Head of Product at ServiceNow believes that a unified data architecture is required for pharmaceutical companies to provide agility and flexibility in their operations. They also discuss the success of digital transformation in nonregulated manufacturing and the niche market for industrial IoT companies in the pharmaceutical space. The Tegus Client asks about the experience of working with Aizon, and the Former Head of Product at ServiceNow explains that they were ahead of ServiceNow in defining the interfaces between the two companies and that there were some challenges in presenting data.

**Q: What current MES systems are you currently using? Which others are you familiar with?**

**A:** I was a partner with Aizon at ServiceNow. ServiceNow and Aizon had a partnership on a few levels, including Aizon providing GxP validated analytics platform while ServiceNow provided the post-analytic workflows to drive manufacturing action by the employees.

**Client**
Hello. Thank you for speaking with me today. I am really just trying to better understand the role of existing manufacturing software in the biopharma space. So thinking about data aggregation, any MES systems, QMS systems, and really trying to understand the ways in which biopharma companies and any CDMOs or any relevant players may be thinking about future innovations and future investments in the space. So maybe we can just begin by getting a little bit more on your background, current role and any sort of relevant experience?

**Expert**
Sure. So my background, I've been in the manufacturing environment from the beginning. I'm a chemical engineer by trade. I started working at Exxon, but then worked at Siemens, Schneider Electric, GE, Hitachi, ServiceNow where I was the Head of Product for manufacturing and now Amazon, I'm the Head of Product for manufacturing here as well.

**Client**
Awesome. It sounds like you have some really relevant experience for us. So we'd love to get a sense of specifically in the biopharma space, what existing MES systems or other sort of point solutions are typically in place are you're using?

**Expert**
Okay. So what particular kinds of systems are you looking for? I mean anything in particular or top players in this space?

**Client**
Yes. So I'm trying to understand in biomanufacturing, what the sort of current landscape is around digital maturity specifically thinking about MES systems as an example, but also thinking about other point solutions like QMS systems, ERP systems, and also would love to understand as well to what degree organizations are focusing on data aggregation across existing digital solutions.

**Expert**
Okay. I can talk to you about my experience working with partners in this space. Because I haven't worked at a biopharmaceutical company.

**Client**
Exactly.

**Expert**
Okay, definitely been partners with many, many companies that do have specific offerings in the pharma space and a lot of aggregation. And what I found is that they're actually really kind of in start-up mode, I would say, sort of in that data aggregation layer, I'll call it validated, GxP-compliant types of IoT solutions as it gets to various companies. Are you looking for like specific examples? Are you looking for use cases or things that they can solve or?

**Client**
Yes, specific examples and use cases if you have, that would be really great?

**Expert**
Okay. At ServiceNow, we partnered with a company called Aizon. I'm not sure how they pronounce it, and we worked with their CEO and their Chief Product Officer to create partnerships there. At ServiceNow, we were a workflow engine and capable company, but we didn't do the data aggregation and data analytics. So partnering with them gave us the opportunity to really bring in IoT data but also validate the solutions and the ability to deploy those solutions to the various lines and make them applicable for the pharma space.

And then on top of that, we would close the loop with very specific workflows on actions to take now that may be an alarm or alert that had come out saying that this particular analytic may have drifted and/or there's an alarm or alert on this type of system. So that's one example. Tulip was another company that we had worked with.

They're more on the low-code, no-code, but also directly in the execution space. They do have validated solutions in that area, but rather than a preconfigured type of analytics or application being very lightweight and starting to piece them together.

And then there were other players that I'll say were more traditional in the MES space, companies like Plex or Infor that are couple of ones that we had worked with in that area. Infor moving more into the ERP space actually but having some of the core capabilities there. I think those were the biggest ones that we had worked on towards in terms of partnerships in each one of those areas.

Got it. And would love to also hear a little bit more about the work that you're currently doing at Amazon and specifically, how you're thinking about your solutions within the biopharma space and thinking about how your solution sort of fits within the sort of existing data platform landscape for biomanufacturing?

**Expert**
About what we're doing in my current role? Is that what you're asking?

**Client**
Yes.

**Expert**
I can't talk about a lot of the things that we're doing because we haven't released the health care solutions yet. So I can tell you what we have released at Amazon, for example the Health Cloud capabilities not necessarily on the biopharmaceutical manufacturing side, more on the health records, health aggregation.

I'll call it on the provider side or payer side of the business, but not on the pharmaceutical side. We are working on capabilities and solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturing, but we haven't released products or announced our product strategy on those yet, so I can't talk about those.

**Client**
Got it. But even that sort of color is helpful as well. So I know you taught it a little bit about your work while at ServiceNow with Aizon, talking about how you sort of allowed or sort of worked directly with their CEO and CPO to create some of those product offerings within the Aizon platform.

Would love to maybe just dive a little bit deeper there and understand how sort of ServiceNow works directly with Aizon and how you sort of worked with them as they scaled and built some of their products and what that sort of relationship looked like?

**Expert**
Okay. So at ServiceNow, we actually had two roles with Aizon in terms of the partnership. The first role, we had released a product called OT Service Management or OT Management, which actually was a configuration management database or CMDB of the operational technology solutions in the biopharmaceutical space. And so we had aggregated data from OT security providers. Are you familiar with that term, if I use that term? Do you need an elaboration on what that is?
DO NOT COPY

**Client**
Yes, would love just a brief elaboration there?

**Expert**
Sure. So OT security providers, they have, I'll call it, like a gateway appliance that they install in the operational technology network in the manufacturing shop floor and they do passive networks detection of the devices that are attached to the network. And then ServiceNow would aggregate all of that information to give an entire list of capabilities and systems that were interconnected in the manufacturing environment.

And so we would extract that list and then we would provide that to Aizon in terms of the types of connections and to call it the metadata, right, the metadata around how they could connect to manufacturing systems in that environment, how they were logically connected into a contextual model. And then the Aizon platform would do its magic, right? It would pull in the information. It would build out the analytics solutions. It would allow for the data clients and all the analytics to take place.

That would then operationalize and allow for the creation of alarms, alerts or any other kind of anomalies, which would then feed it back to ServiceNow now that an alarm or alert took place. ServiceNow will then drive a workflow for an operator or for maybe even the data science to rerun or recalculate the model or retune the model or to run the CI/CD pipeline around the validation of the entire solution.

**Client**
Got it. And so to what degree, I guess, ServiceNow that sort of allowed for the sort of metadata of capabilities that are all interconnected? To what degree would you say that Aizon platform was able to integrate sort of maybe greater volume of data than other existing data aggregation platforms or even just sort of a cloud-based MES? Just trying to sort of understand what types of data you were providing to Aizon and then subsequently coming back to ServiceNow versus any sort of existing applications of the platforms?

**Expert**
Sorry, you're asking if the Aizon platform was more--

**Client**
I think broader question is just understanding why Aizon and what other providers out there that could have offered a similar service or serve a similar purpose to what you're trying to build, so just compare and contrast the two options and why you went with Aizon and just what the experience was like working with them?

**Expert**
Sure. And I don't think scalability was the primary choice. I think that was the intent of your question. Like were they able to ingest more data? That wasn't any of the deciding factor. The deciding factor was the trust and the ability to create the validated solution, right, to actually have the full GMP compliance end to end for the entire solution as well as integrate with ours because our solution didn't provide out-of-the-box their GMP compatibility and the Aizon solution did.

So by working with them, the inbound side, we were able to get compliance and now on the outbound side, we were able to get compliance. And that allowed for our solutions to be leveraged across the board much easier in the pharmaceutical space. So the differentiation there was Aizon was solely focused on that, and it was much easier.

They also had joint what we call design partners or design customers. Our first and early customers were also their first and early customers. And our customers actually brought us together in some of these conversations. They said, “Hey, we're using both of you on all of these particular scenarios”, like the workflow that I talked about. It would be great if the systems worked together, right? And so our initial customers were both early-data or early-stage customers for us both.

**Client**
Got it. And this might be a silly question, but the GXP compliance around data aggregation is like unique capability that Aizon has developed. Is that something that you see others in the data aggregation space within context of biopharma manufacturing, trying to replicate? And is it a high barrier to entry? Is it just a matter of their focus on a very specific regulated customer base, and so they've built that solution and others aren't focused there? Or are there just others--

**Expert**
Yes. I can give you the anecdotes from our customers today is that a lot of the customers say they have to do that work for themselves, right? And by that, I mean vendors today will provide the components to tools and maybe the ease of auditability of the solution, but won't actually provide a fully validated answer, right? And so if you look at a cloud provider, they will provide a fully validated staging area or a fully validated, complete cloud environment for a manufacturer to run in.

The manufacturer needs to build, validate and audit and provide that complete trail. We think one of the advantages that we thought was Aizon does that, right? It does actually provide the end-to-end capability and is very targeted.

They're not trying to be generically all of a manufacturing solution, whereas many of the other players and partners were generic and then offer this compliance and capability around GxP and GMP specifically as either an add-on or like they would support their customer doing but not providing out-of-the-box. Does that

make sense?

**Client**
Got it. And along similar lines, I think one question we've been trying to wrestle with is just customer readiness and ease of sale for a solution like this. Obviously, this type of GxP-compliant data aggregation analytics platform is where this market, I think, is going and needs to go, but I mean, how easy of the sale is a product offering like this and you have an out-of-the-box application like you described with ServiceNow.

Is that something that customers easily gobble up because they're looking for things like this? Or is it more of a strategic sale where you have to teach them the capabilities and how to use it and a lot of change management and it goes through this long innovation cycle where they pilot it and try it and then et cetera? Or is it something that it's a need now and they're desperately looking for solutions?

**Expert**
Yes. So I have a couple of anecdotes in a couple of ways as kind of segmenting that. First, in terms of companies, right? Companies that are, I'll say, more start-ups in the pharmaceutical space want this. Like they want it out-of-the-box, they want it ready to go. They know that this will make their lives easier, and they don't have any legacy to really rely on, right? So if they're new, they're starting in this manufacturing area and there are a lot in that space. They are asking for these out-of-the-box kind of validated solution.

The second is as new drugs or new manufacturing processes get enabled, that usually comes with new systems and maybe sometimes even new equipment, and as they do that, they're asking for these newer types of solutions. Going back and retrofitting and then putting a data analytics layer on top of an existing brownfield environment that's running is the harder sale. That would be more a strategic one.

So I would say those are the categories, either start-up mentality or for new drugs in that new manufacturing environment, those are the two primary targets that I would think the sale is much easier. Does that make sense?

**Client**
Okay. And again, anecdotes are fine. But do you see, okay, eventually, is it just a matter of time, maybe the sales cycle is one, two years for these more difficult sales, but eventually, this type of platform, data aggregation, I mean, do you see that as a foundational platform required to operate a manufacturing plant in 2025, 2026? Or do you think it's going to be continued use of point solutions?

So maybe you have a bioreactor monitoring solution, maybe you have a yield optimization solution. And it's just plugging holes in the process versus you have this core infrastructure, you're building all of these models, all of your data is running through it, and it's informing maybe even in real-time and adaptive, and that's where the market is going. Is that like a 2050-type vision? I know it's a hard question.

**Expert**
Yes, I have an opinion, right? My statement is what I can give you, right? And it will be just backed by the conversations that I've had with various customers. I can't say that I could point to a specific research that says this, but as especially in today's environment of supply chains and for pharmaceutical companies that are feeling the squeeze of, wow, I saw them make this COVID vaccine and tested and get it out like in record time.

Why can't others start to behave and act in this kind of agile, rapid development environment. The need for these kinds of systems emerges very quickly, right, and in order to provide that kind of agility and flexibility, I need advanced analytics solutions in my operations to ensure that when I do start a new environment or I need to respond or I need to keep these kind of continuous operations, a unified data architecture like that is definitely required.

What's the time line of that is, whether that's a three year time line or a 10-year time line, it's probably somewhere in the middle. But my experience has been when you see a Merck or Pfizer, start to adopt one of these, it's kind of like dumb. It's adopted and it's proven in this, why don't I have one of those.

And there's only one or two, right, of almost every technology that's so they've seen in the pharma space. And in the rest of manufacturing, it's like a complete open wild west game in pharmaceutical. One or two makes that validated solution and they meet the compliance and the regulatory and it's easy and somebody stands up at a conference and everybody else is like, well, okay, sign us up.

**Client**
Yes. And obviously, we spend most of our time in the life sciences. But as I understand it, I think you have a broader view of the manufacturing landscape. Are there any other industries or examples where this type of digital innovation has happened and been successful? Or are there any success stories?

**Expert**
And again, if you don't have context for the broader ecosystem, you can ignore my question, but I would be curious to understand if there's any case studies out there of how long what it looks like?

Yes. I mean digital transformation in general manufacturing, nonregulated manufacturing, I'll call it that, right, because food manufacturing does kind of have a little bit of regulation that is not as strict as GMP or GxP, but it is moving in that direction. But nonregulated manufacturing has been moving in this way and having these kind of data aggregation, multi-site, multi-factory, cross-site analytics best practices for a while.

If you're looking for like use cases or best practices, all of the big cloud companies and I call them, IoT platforms have their representative sets on their websites that have, hey, here's a proven success story and when it's gotten them. With the different and unique is, again, the pharma companies have been left on their own to take that and actually make it validated to actually meet these compliance and auditability regulations that are required.

And it's been considered a niche by the industrial IoT companies, right, of the past. That's my experience, right? GE Predix was kind of the initial one of those. I was part of that, sorry, I'll claim it. But then each one of the ones that have come up, C3 or any of the other kind of IoT or analytic companies and now AWS, Azure, GCP all have their IoT offerings. It's a niche market for them such that each one of those companies has chosen not to specify, “Hey, we are a pharmaceutical life sciences, special IoT-enabled brands, right?

**Client**
Yes. And I think there's a question there that we've been wrestling with is just the size of this market and how big could a platform get in this space. But it sounds like at least you highlighted that pharma was left alone because they didn't have a validated system and a big step towards being able to realize this vision of digital transformation is having a validated system, which is why in your past like you partnered with a company like Aizon, makes sense?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
And maybe just generally, if you could talk just the experience working with Aizon. It sounds like a positive experience, but just curious what it was like actually developing the product and implementing issues or if it went as expected and if there's any types of hiccups?

**Expert**
I think from the ServiceNow side, we probably put them through a ringer or two because the ServiceNow partner ecosystem is very mature or as it was because I'm no longer there, but it was very mature, and we had a process, and we ask all companies to go through that process. And all companies struggle with the ServiceNow partner process by default.

But the Aizon team actually I think they were ahead of us in not only their want and desire for the partnership, but also in kind of their architectural depictions, how they would work with defining the

interfaces between the two companies. They did a lot of the leading work in how that would come together. So I think that was very helpful. Then my team could just come in right next to them and say, “Okay, well, let's marry the way that these interfaces are going to work."

ServiceNow also has a stance that we published standard interfaces and thou shalt comply with them just happening to be the bigger company has its advantage, right, in that space. And so there was some challenges with the way that our system was able to present data meant that we actually had to make some changes on our side and that actually took a little while because we're trying to satisfy and make sure we don't break any of our existing customers or interfaces that we really had.
