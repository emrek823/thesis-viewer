## Slide 1: EITRI AI

EITRI AI
Building the intelligence layer for biopharma manufacturing

## Slide 2: Biopharma manufacturing ops are immensely complex, with uniquely high stakes

*   Quality issues at manufacturing sites delay FDA approvals and trigger recalls that lead to **multi-billion dollar costs and losses**
*   Fragmented supply chains impede capacity visibility and cause shortages that sacrifice **hundreds of millions of revenue**
*   Steep manufacturing costs and long timelines to transfer and optimize processes are **existential threats to small biotechs**

## Slide 4: Manufacturing is dominated by manual workflows that increase time, cost, and risk

**Process Development**
Scientists conduct dozens of bench-scale runs to optimize unit operations and parameters and draft a “Process Description"
**6-12+ months**

**Partner Selection**
Sponsor issues an RFP to contract manufacturers (CDMOs). CDMOs submit proposals, which the sponsor reviews manually.
**6+ months**

**Knowledge Transfer**
Sponsor and CDMO compare the Process Description to the CDMO's capabilities, identify gaps and risks, and draft transfer artifacts.
**8+ months**

**Quality Assurance**
CDMO shares batch results with the sponsor, who confirms that they match prior results and resolves any significant deviations
**1+ months**

**Capacity Management**
Sponsors and CDMOs manually track capacity across sites manually inform CapEx allocation decisions.
**1+ months**

## Slide 5: AI is going to transform manufacturing operations from end to end

**Process Development**
Embedded AI copilots will predict optimal process steps and parameters using historical data.

**Partner Selection**
Bespoke search agents will analyze vendor proposals for critical expertise and capabilities and recommend best fits.

**Knowledge Transfer**
AI-native data platforms will automatically compare requirements, assess risks, and generate transfer documents.

**Quality Assurance**
Embedded AI copilots will track real-time deviations, identify root cause, and recommend remediations based on historical data.

**Capacity Management**
Agent swarms will ingest cross-functional supply chain data to visualize capacity, and recommend allocation decisions.

## Slide 18: Knowledge transfer is the bottleneck in scaling new treatments from lab to patient

Every drug product needs to **transfer process know-how and requirements from research to manufacturing** before it can start clinical trials or launch in the market.

Knowledge transfer today is painfully inefficient, and **introduces significant cost, time delay, and quality risk.**

**Key Metrics:**
*   **$1M+** added cost
*   **6+** month delays
*   **20%+** of batches fail spec

CONFIDENTIAL 18

## Slide 19: Knowledge transfer is a manual process...

**Research drafts process requirement documents, and reviews manufacturing process and results**

**Manufacturing compares requirements to facility capabilities, and drafts a manufacturing process**

**Issues with Manual Process:**
*   **Hundreds of hours** drafting and comparing documents line-by-line
*   **Missed process differences lead to failed batches and repeated runs**
*   **Fragmented manufacturing data requires ongoing, manual analysis**

CONFIDENTIAL 19

## Slide 20: ...that recurs throughout the drug development life cycle

**Manufacturing process definition and new product introduction**
*   **6-8 months**

**Scale up to support pivotal trials and market launch**
*   **1-3 months**

**Scale down to match decreasing demand**
*   **1-3 months**

**Development Phases:**
Preclinical | Phase 1/2 Clinical | Phase 3 & Marketing | Life Cycle Management
