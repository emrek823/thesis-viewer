### Fundraising Strategy & Timing

- Alejandro batting 100% on investor fit conversations
	- Only passes due to fund misalignment or non-investing status
	- Should expand potential investor pool given high success rate
- Funding composition targets:
	- $1M from angels
	- $2M from Torch Capital (potential co-lead)
	- Virtue investment close to zero (fund structure constraints)
	- Atria contribution to be determined
- Launch timing: January fundraising with prep starting now
	- Better to fundraise while approaching milestones vs after achieving them
	- Creates momentum through process vs presenting completed story

### Current Pipeline Development

- Custodian partnerships progressing:
	- Kroger deal moving forward
	- Office Ally deal expected before year-end (litmus test given New Mountain ownership)
	- No pushback on deal terms from Office Ally despite ownership change
- Record retrieval company deals in progress:
	- Site Sonar signed
	- Llama Labs pending
	- Get Codes pending
- Rushing to complete deals ahead of January fundraise

### Investor Outreach Plan

- Target 15 tier-1 firms for initial outreach wave
- Fund categories identified:
	- Good seed funds: Susa, 12 Below, Pathlight, Max, Acme
	- Multi-stage funds: GV, Bessemer, Andreessen, Lightspeed
	- Specialized funds: ABC (tier 1), Signal Fire (Shahir connection)
- Removed strategics from target list
- Removed Transformation Capital (too late stage)
- Intro ownership to be divided between Virtue and Atria teams

### Torch Capital Strategy

- Positioned as potential co-lead to create pressure on other investors
- If term sheet received (target: December 8-9), will leverage with other firms already in conversation
- Secure Torch money early, then approach others saying “only looking for $3M more”
- Torch team respected for direct approach (“we don’t give a shit about January timeline”)

### Next Steps

- Alejandro: Send fundraising blurb to Virtue team
- Virtue team (Emre/Sean/Chris): Align on intro ownership and reach out to 15 tier-1 firms within 48 hours
- Chris follow-up with GV connection (channeling through Arun relationship)
- Reference validation: Travis providing strong backing (board member at Datavault), positive back-channel through Mark Karsh
