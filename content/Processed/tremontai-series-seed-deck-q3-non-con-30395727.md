## Slide 3: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

# The status quo in drug safety assessment is broken. AI can help.

Preclinical toxicology is one of drug development's biggest bottlenecks: slowed by manual workflows, subjective reads, and labor-intensive reporting. Tremont AI accelerates these processes for faster, more consistent, and more reliable safety assessment.

## Slide 4: (Untitled)

This slide illustrates the process of safety & toxicology and preliminary efficacy assessment.

### Safety & Toxicology
*   Healthy animals receive a drug.
*   Tissue necropsy is performed.
*   Assessment of histologic signs of toxicity.

### Efficacy (preliminary)
*   Animals with disease receive a drug.
*   Biopsies from organ of interest are taken.
*   Assessment of drug efficacy.

### Charts showing Change in tumor from baseline (%) for different toxicity/efficacy levels:

**Chart 1: Low toxicity, Low efficacy**
*   Y-axis: Change in tumor from baseline (%)
*   Range: -100 to 100
*   Data points (approximate, for illustration purposes): All animals show tumor regression (negative change) or minimal growth/regression, indicating low efficacy.

**Chart 2: Low toxicity, High efficacy**
*   Y-axis: Change in tumor from baseline (%)
*   Range: -100 to 100
*   Data points (approximate, for illustration purposes): Most animals show significant tumor regression, indicating high efficacy.

**Chart 3: High toxicity, High efficacy**
*   Y-axis: Change in tumor from baseline (%)
*   Range: -100 to 100
*   Data points (approximate, for illustration purposes): Most animals show significant tumor regression, but there's a toxicity warning icon, implying high toxicity alongside high efficacy.

## Slide 5: PROBLEM Preclinical Toxicology: A Time and Cost Bottleneck

# PROBLEM
# Preclinical Toxicology: A Time and Cost Bottleneck

### Resource-Intensive Process
*   ~10,000 slides in a 12-month chronic rodent study
*   >50 organs per animal, across multiple dose groups
*   Only a few hundred board-certified toxicologic pathologists worldwide

### Scale of the Challenge
*   ~500-700 GLP studies annually at a large pharma
*   Pathology costs alone per chronic rodent study around $100K-$250K
*   Review adds ~3–6 months after in-life for chronic studies

### Imperfect methods
*   Needles in haystacks
*   Subjectivity in distinguishing spontaneous from drug-induced lesion
*   Semi-quantitative labelling at best

## Slide 6: PROBLEM The Result: A Broken, Expensive System

# PROBLEM
# The Result: A Broken, Expensive System

### False Negatives
Promising drug candidates rejected unfairly, wasting research investment and delaying treatments

### Financial Impact
Increased development costs, wasted resources, and missed market opportunities

### False Positives
Unsafe compounds advance to clinical trials, creating patient risk and catastrophic late-stage failures

### Development Delays
Extended timelines reduce patent exclusivity period and delay clinical trials

## Slide 22: (Untitled)

This slide illustrates the methodology and results for evaluating TRACE (FT) agreement with pathologist consensus.

### a. Methodology
1.  **Input:** 100 slides from 22 studies.
2.  **Processing:**
    *   **TRACE (FT):** Generates Lesion-wise predictions (e.g., Hypertrophy, Bile duct proliferation images shown).
    *   **Pathologist annotations (n=10):** Independent diagnosis.
3.  **Analysis:** Analyse majority to form a **Consensus (n=3)**.

### b. Quadratic Cohen's score

This bar chart shows the Quadratic Cohen's score (from 0.0 to 1.0) for TRACE (FT) agreement with consensus vs. Average pathologist agreement with consensus for various lesions.

| Lesion                      | TRACE (FT) agreement with consensus (approx. score) | Average pathologist agreement with consensus (approx. score) |
