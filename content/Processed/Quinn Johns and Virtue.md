### 2026 Strategic Focus

- Primary goal: Eitri absolutely dominating first customer segment as manufacturing intelligence solution by end of 2026
	- Clinical stage biotech working with CDMOs: all innovative leading-edge biopharma pulling CDMO reports through Eitri vs SharePoint for batch review and decision making
	- CDMO segment: Eitri team building agentic infrastructure on top of legacy systems of record
- De-risking milestone: proving foundation, establishing strong/growing business around initial wedge use case
	- Creates base of operations to expand into additional segments (larger pharma, commercial development)
	- Clear path to subsequent applications beyond initial wedge

### Core Market Thesis & Earned Insights

- Central thesis: Decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized
	- Historical model: single company handled entire drug product manufacturing (small molecules, synthetic chemistry)
	- Current fragmentation: separate companies for drug substance vs drug product
		- API synthesis → different company manufactures pill around molecule
		- Biologics: protein manufacturer ships 5L bags → separate company handles vial filling
- Market evolution: Continued fragmentation across entire supply chain
	- More suppliers/manufacturers per company portfolio
	- Increased specialization within specific drug products
	- Virtual biotechs (10-person teams) struggle to navigate constellation of manufacturing partners
- Eitri positioning: Intelligence layer to navigate increasingly complex manufacturing partnerships
	- End-to-end platform from process recommendations to CDMO partner selection
	- Marketplace dynamic connecting biotech needs with appropriate manufacturing capabilities

### Product Architecture & Development

- Platform vs applications model: Core platform supporting multiple specialized applications
- Product uncertainty: Whether different pain points create synergistic platform (1+1=3) vs independent business lines
- Clear separation identified:
	- Process optimization: scientific problem requiring different tools/expertise/modeling
	- Partner selection, tech transfer, batch disposition, deviation investigation: similar data core (documented operation results from paper records)
- Five key application areas:

### Team & Operations Update

- New hires performing well: Sam (drug discovery background) and Zach (fintech background)
	- Strong ownership mentality and self-starter approach
	- Meshing well as team in new Nomad office space
- Current focus: Building domain expertise in bioprocess manufacturing
	- Sam needs manufacturing knowledge despite clinical trial familiarity
	- Zach requires broader industry education (phase 2 trials, regulatory processes, funding stages)
- Holiday plans: Quinn traveling to Michigan, returning to NYC
- Not attending JPM: Determined not high ROI at current stage (more relevant for later-stage investment conversations)

### Next Steps

- January 8th follow-up call to formalize 2026 strategy and goals
- Quinn sending pre-read memo with thoughts on paper before next meeting
- Continued market validation conversations to refine ICP and product-market fit
