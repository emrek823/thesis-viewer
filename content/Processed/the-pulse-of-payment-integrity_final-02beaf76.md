Although healthcare payments continue to undergo major transformations, one thing is constant—the need for advancing payment integrity remains paramount for payers.

Every inappropriately paid claim represents a cost that takes away from resources that can be dedicated to member care, and errors continue to erode the payer, provider, patient relationship.

We live in a time where trust and credibility are being questioned more than ever. The culture of payment integrity needs to be focused not only on reducing the total cost of care but also on better patient outcomes and satisfaction. This needed shift includes better alignment between incentives and quality of care and better communication between payers, providers, and patients.

CERIS partners with many healthcare organizations and has witnessed positive changes in payment success drivers, evolving transparency, and provider partnerships. The process and tools involved across the entire provider billing and claims payment lifecycle continues to evolve, and new thinking is mandatory to continue to drive high value healthcare.

We internally worked together to put together this guide as our pulse on payment integrity in 2023. We will cover the following key insights.

*   Barometers of Success
*   Payment Pressure Points
*   Full Cycle PI Drivers
*   Transparency Challenges
*   Transparency Builders
*   Payer Provider Friction
*   Payer Provider Union

We want to offer it to everyone looking to enhance their foundation for holistic payment integrity success and hope you find it useful.

## Barometers of Success

CERIS
A CORVEL COMPANY

Every organization should document their payment integrity success barometer. Barometers of success are different for every organization depending on their current PI governance and structure. Typically, the key performance metrics should quantifiably assess the effectiveness of current payment accuracy and prevention efforts and identify areas for improvement.

The payment integrity success barometer should also be able to determine trends, identify risks, and highlight opportunities for improvement in each of these performance metrics. Overall, the barometer is an important tool for healthcare organizations to track the success of their efforts to ensure resources are being used effectively to improve quality and reduce costs.

**Flowchart: 5 Key Factors for Successful Payment Integrity Program**
1.  Leadership
2.  Data
3.  Collaboration
4.  CPI (Continuous Process Improvement)
5.  Education

We have found these 5 key factors promote a successful payment integrity program:

1.  **Strong leadership and governance:**
    This is the foundation to establish clear goals, objectives, workplans, and processes and ensures compliance with changing regulations, payment methodologies, and industry standards.
2.  **Data-driven approach:**
    Involving advanced analytics and technology, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in payment data expedites success.
3.  **Collaboration and coordination:**
    Unification of different departments and stakeholders creates a thriving culture. (i.e., vendors, partners, finance, operations, legal, IT, clinical teams)
4.  **Continuous Process Improvement:**
    A key component of success that involves regularly reviewing and refining processes to identify and eliminate challenges. Regular monitoring, reporting, and analyzing will create space for innovation, shared ideas, and improvement modeling.
5.  **Provider and member education:**
    Effective education and outreach helps providers and members understand their role in accurate payments for appropriate services.

## Payment Pressure Points

CERIS
A CORVEL COMPANY

The top 5 current payment pressure points we have seen include:

1.  **Telehealth pressures:** the rapid growth of telehealth services have been a great thing, but they have also created new payment models to consider in a payment accuracy process. There is variability in telehealth services and coverage, so it can be a challenge to making sure payment is correct. Because services are no longer physically taking place in an office, it can also make it harder to verify the validity of services.
2.  **New claim process pressures:** There are increasing administrative burdens and changes in claim processes such as additional diagnosis around COVID-19, an increased difficulty in forecasting utilization, increased visits for therapies, hospital at home initiatives, excess in Rx prescription early refills and quantities, and difficulty assessing appropriate length of stays.
3.  **Operational pressures:** The great resignation, silent quitting, and labor shortages can all exacerbate billing inaccuracies and an increase in payment errors. There are flex work schedules, remote billing staff, and a need to allocate resources in different areas.
4.  **Regulatory pressures:** Transparency continues to be at the top of the priority list relating to federal government regulation as well as changing processes around surprise billing. There are also individual state mandates around claim reviews and non-essential claims processes that were created around COVID.
5.  **VBC pressures:** Value-based care payment methodologies are already prevalent in government programs and increasingly in commercial programs. While this delivery model is a favorable trend impacting the quality of care rather than the volume of care, there a many different structures to these models that can impact payment integrity services. Payment integrity in the context of VBC is ensuring payments are made based on the agreement and accurately reflect the actual quality of care provided. It is a critical factor in the success of VBC because it ensures the right providers are rewarded for delivering quality outcomes.

With these ever changing challenges, people continue to innovate, and payment integrity programs are the perfect place to mitigate these additional pressures. Improving your payment integrity program to accommodate new disruptors requires increasing your payment integrity expertise. Now more than ever, payers are looking to partner with vendors to deliver the tools, techniques, and talent to support their internal programs.

Tech is important, but the humans in the loop are the essential key to promoting a culture of transparency and accountability in the process.

With transparency top of mind across the industry, it is important to recognize the challenges in payment integrity that hinder transparency and techniques to overcome those challenges.

**Flowchart: 5 Key Challenges Hindering Transparency**
1.  Silos
2.  Interoperability
3.  Regulation
4.  Tech
5.  Resistance

There are 5 key challenges that can hinder transparency in payment integrity including:

1.  A fragmented and siloed organizational structure limits collaboration and coordination among different departments and stakeholders, and can make it difficult to achieve a holistic view of payment accuracy and integrity.
2.  The lack of standardization and interoperability in healthcare data makes it difficult to track payment information, identify trends and patterns, and detect errors and waste.
3.  The complex and ever-changing regulatory environment can make it difficult for healthcare organizations to keep up with payment requirements, which can lead to confusion in the payment integrity process.
4.  A lack of technology and analytic tools can limit an organization's ability to effectively monitor accuracy and make it difficult to identify areas for improvement.
5.  Resistance to change and a lack of support from stakeholders can make it difficult to implement new processes and technologies that effectively promote transparency and accountability.

By addressing these challenges, payers can promote greater transparency in their PI efforts contributing to lower total cost of care and improved outcomes. Transparency building techniques should be a part of continuous improvement in every payers PI playbook.

4.  Inconsistency
5.  Training

The 5 key factors that we have seen cause the greatest friction between payors and providers around payment integrity practices include:

1.  Payers and providers may have different priorities and goals, such as cost containment, quality of care, and patient satisfaction, that can lead to conflicting interests and tensions around payment issues.
2.  Incentives for payers and providers are not always aligned, leading to disagreements around payment policies and procedures, and causing friction in their relationship.
3.  A lack of trust and transparency in the payment process can lead to disputes, misunderstandings, and disagreements between payers and providers.
4.  Changes to policies and procedures without proper notification, can lead to confusion and frustration for providers, and can cause friction in the relationship.
5.  A lack of education and outreach to providers about payment policies and procedures and the importance of accurate payments can lead to misunderstandings and frustration, and can cause friction in the relationship between payers and providers.

Payers can address friction head on and promote collaboration to improve relationships creating more efficiency and accuracy in the long run.
