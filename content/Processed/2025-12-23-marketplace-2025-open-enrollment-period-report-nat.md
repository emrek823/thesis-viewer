***Glossary***

**HealthCare.gov Marketplace:** The 31 Marketplaces that use the HealthCare.gov platform for the 2025 coverage year, including the Federally-facilitated Marketplaces (FFMs) and State-based Marketplaces (SBMs) that use the federal platform (HealthCare.gov). The 31 HealthCare.gov Marketplaces for 2025 include: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

**State-based Marketplaces (SBMs):** The Marketplaces in 19 states and the District of Columbia that operate their own eligibility and enrollment platforms. The 20 SBMs for 2025 include: California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. Generally, the data metric definitions provided here are applicable to the SBM metrics, with some exceptions. Please contact the SBM plans for additional information on their metrics. 

**Cumulative Plan Selections:** The cumulative metric represents the total number of people who have submitted an application and selected a plan, net of any cancellations from a consumer or cancellations from an issuer that have occurred from November 1, 2024, through the end of the reporting period. To have their coverage effectuated, consumers generally need to pay their first month’s health plan premium, if applicable. This release does not report the number of effectuated enrollments.

**New Consumers (HealthCare.gov Marketplace):** Consumers are considered new if they did not have 2024 Marketplace coverage through a HealthCare.gov Marketplace through December 31, 2024, and made a 2025 plan selection through a HealthCare.gov Marketplace.

**New Consumers (SBM):** Consumers are considered new if they did not have 2024 Marketplace coverage in an SBM where they made a 2025 plan selection through that SBM.

**Returning Consumers (HealthCare.gov Marketplace):**Consumers are considered returning if they have 2024 Marketplace coverage through a HealthCare.gov Marketplace through December 31, 2024, and either actively select the same plan or a new plan for 2025. The returning consumers count includes consumers who have been automatically re-enrolled in their current plan for 2025 coverage.

**Returning Consumers (SBM):** Consumers are considered returning if they have 2024 Marketplace coverage through December 31, 2024, in the same SBM where they actively select the same plan or a new plan for 2025. The returning consumers count includes consumers who have been automatically re-enrolled in their 2024 plan or an alternative suggested plan for 2025 coverage. SBMs that have conducted auto-re-enrollments report the following data on plan selections for auto re-enrolled consumers.

|  |  |

[[1]](#_ftnref1) The “returning consumers” metric in this report includes consumers who have returned to their respective Marketplace through the reporting date and selected a plan for 2025 coverage, and consumers who have been automatically re-enrolled for 2025 coverage based on their 2024 enrollment or a suggested alternative plan. Please see the glossary for data on auto re-enrolled consumers that SBM plans have reported to CMS.

[[2]](#_ftnref2) In addition to the reported Qualified Health Plan (QHP) plan selections, Minnesota and Oregon have a Basic Health Program (BHP), which provides coverage to consumers with household incomes at or below 200% and above 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, who are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, and otherwise would be eligible for a QHP. New York has also implemented a new coverage program, the Essential Plan (EP) Expansion, under a section 1332 waiver. The EP Expansion generally mirrors the state’s previously utilized BHP with expanded eligibility for certain residents with estimated household incomes up to 250% of the FPL. See <https://www.cms.gov/files/document/ny-1332-amendment-fact-sheet.pdf> for more information about New York’s EP Expansion. As of December 28, 2024, Oregon had 29,705 individuals enroll in a BHP, and New York had 1,625,174 individuals enroll in the EP Expansion under the state’s approved section 1332 waiver program. Minnesota’s BHP data was not available at the time of this report.

[[3]](#_ftnref3)These metrics reflect available data through January 4, 2025, for FFM states and through December 28, 2024, for SBM plans, except for Idaho, which reports OEP data from October 15, 2024 to December 16, 2024, and Rhode Island, which reports data through December 7, 2024.
