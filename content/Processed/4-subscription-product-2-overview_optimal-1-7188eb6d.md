## Slide 4: Traditional Options Fall Short

### Traditional Options Fall Short

1.  **"Specialty Drug Costs Are Unmanageable"**
    *   ❌ High-cost medications blow through budgets with no sourcing controls.
    *   ✅ Routes specialty through PAP/MAP/international sourcing, with member-level PA.
2.  **"Every Renewal is a Black Box"**
    *   ❌ PBMs offer vague renewal pricing without showing utilization-based trends.
    *   ✅ PMPM pricing is based on claims or forecasted utilization—not guesswork.
3.  **"There is no Predictable Financial Structure"**
    *   ❌ Sponsors are exposed to open-ended financial risk with no clear stop-loss alignment.
    *   ✅ PMPMs are capped and aligned with stop-loss deductibles to manage total exposure.
4.  **"The Formularies Are Bloated & Inefficient"**
    *   ❌ Plans cover too many drugs without cost-based filters, increasing waste.
    *   ✅ Formulary is tightly curated (Closed) or PA-governed (Open), reducing unnecessary spend.
