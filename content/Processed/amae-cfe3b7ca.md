8VC / Bling / Able feedback

We need to dominate 3-5 states

Acquisition

Middle ground

Why does engagement matter? FFS out of the gate

SMI vs. moderate/mild

Goals of the

Patient acquisition bucket

GTM

Expecting initial contract within 3-6 months and taken aback

10-15K @ UCLA

Tiny fraction of SMI population

Retention rates -

Education in our model

Refine - our thinking

Cash pay - $3k PMPM (

Just off FFS we can get 50% gross margins

Patient acquisition

Contract

UCLA has huge primary group that has social workers that take care of SMI

500K primary care - 4-5000 of those with really complicated patients (a lot of which have SMI)

Managing 5000 SMi patients

We keep uncovering new buckets

Typically send to IOPs and PHPs in LA - they stop at 30-45 days and patient is left on their own

UCLA is launching MA plan

Sonia great in summary

Landmark and Equip

Asks

Payers / providers

Tech - BI / analytics, further integration of measurement based care

HIring - folks for the clinic

Adolescent SMI - advisors, etc (March 1)

Doctors are hard to wring money out of

WHen I did it, I was pushed into the space b/t the payer and the government. Enterprise world and sales cycle was slight harder vs. the provider side

I don’t see that space evolving real fast

BIden hasn’t made it part of his thing

Meaningful use wasn’t worth it

MIPS was dum

Single payer and rationed

MA - 2011

RWE - 2015

2023???

Enrollment not recruitment

Payer / provider / pharma - value-based with payer (doesn’t change prescribing

Give drug for free and capture some of the upside. Breaking stark law (OIG)

Kaiser for-profit and more modern

Oscar is getting slaughterede on
