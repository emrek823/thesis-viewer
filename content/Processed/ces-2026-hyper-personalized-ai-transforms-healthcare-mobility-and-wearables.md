In recent years, the dominant technological trend at CES has been AI (artificial intelligence). While the overarching trend at CES 2026 remained unchanged, hyper-personalized AI—more sophisticated and tailored to individual users—has become the new norm. AI has evolved beyond merely providing convenience to understanding users’ emotions and lifestyle habits, proactively intervening based on them. A source from the tech industry stated, “This advancement is thanks to simultaneous progress in AI agent technology and on-device (built-in) AI technology.”

◇Expansion of Hyper-Personalized AI

The healthcare sector, where even the same disease can vary drastically between individuals, is witnessing the fastest adoption of hyper-personalized AI. AI no longer merely measures static bodily conditions but now analyzes health status in real time and provides treatment and diagnostic support. Canadian company Naki Logics won the Best Innovation Award at this year’s CES for its smart earbuds. The product allows users to control digital devices through subtle facial expressions, such as clenching the jaw, blinking, or moving eyebrows. The device interprets each individual’s unique facial signals via AI, enabling paralyzed patients to control electronic devices without using their hands or voice. Unlike brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, it does not require implanting electrodes in the brain, making it safer. Japanese company Orphe showcased a smart insole. This ultra-thin, sensor-equipped product analyzes each user’s unique walking habits 24/7 via AI. Orphe stated, “By measuring weight distribution and balance, it can be applied not only to medical and rehabilitation fields but also to preventive care.” The range of diseases aided by AI is expanding, including orthodontics (InnoD Tech) and pediatric otitis media (EarFlow).

The mobility and robotics sectors are also becoming increasingly specialized and personalized. South Korean company LBSTech received the Best Innovation Award for its AI system designed for transportation-disadvantaged individuals. The system considers not only traffic conditions but also user types—such as wheelchair users and the elderly—to provide optimal routes, including boarding/alighting points, transfer points, and walking environments. South Korean robotics company Hurotics unveiled the wearable robot “H Medi Pro,” which can be worn like clothing to assist with gait rehabilitation exercises. AI trained on joint movement data analyzes abnormal walking patterns within 10 steps and assists muscle movements, enabling customized rehabilitation.

◇On-Device AI Applied to Diverse Devices

The rise of hyper-personalized AI at this year’s CES was made possible by rapid advancements in on-device AI. In the early stages of AI development, cloud-based applications dominated. While this allowed for high processing power, it had a fundamental limitation: AI could not operate on individual devices without internet connectivity. The shift toward on-device AI—where models run directly on devices—has enabled the proliferation of hyper-personalized AI wearables. A key advantage of on-device AI is that data is processed locally, preventing personal information leaks.

Alongside the expansion of hyper-personalized AI, security-focused technologies also emerged. Startup CityFive’s AI wearable device is worn over both ears, unlike typical earbuds. Acting as an AI assistant, it translates over 50 languages in real time. CityFive emphasized, “Our on-device AI protects user privacy.” A source from the tech industry noted, “The focus of AI development has shifted beyond merely advancing models to whether they can be applied to specific industries and practically utilized in daily life.” The new standard for AI is how reliably and meaningfully it delivers value in real-world environments.
