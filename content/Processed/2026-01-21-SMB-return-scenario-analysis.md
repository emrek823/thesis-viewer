## Why $10B+ Is Plausible

### The Math

| Metric | Conservative | Aggressive |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Top 20 pharma as customers | 10 | 18 |
| Average contract value | $15M/yr | $30M/yr |
| Platform ARR | $150M | $540M |
| Revenue multiple | 15x | 25x |
| **Implied valuation** | **$2.25B** | **$13.5B** |

### Historical Precedent

| Company | Revenue at Peak Valuation | Valuation | Multiple |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------|----------|
| GRAIL | ~$0 | $8B | ∞ |
| Palantir (2025) | $2.9B | $423B | 146x |
| Tempus (2025) | $693M | $14B | 20x |
| Veeva (2021 peak) | $1.5B | $50B | 33x |

### Strategic Premium — Potential Acquirers at $10B+

- **Roche** — Already owns Flatiron ($1.9B) + Foundation Medicine ($5.3B). SMB completes the stack.
- **Google/Alphabet** — Owns piece of Tempus. Wants healthcare AI.
- **NVIDIA** — $44M IQVIA proposal shows interest. Wants pharma AI wins.
- **Microsoft** — Healthcare AI push. JEPA aligns with research interests.

## Comparison: Hold $1.8M vs. Add $2.5M Follow-on

| Metric | Hold ($1.8M only) | Add $2.5M ($4.3M total) | Delta |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Ownership (pre-dilution)** | 8.0% | 15.14% | +89% |
| **Fund exposure** | 3.2% | 7.7% | +4.5 pts |
| **Base case proceeds** | $13.6M | $27.2M | +$13.6M |
| **Base case multiple** | 7.6x | 6.3x | -1.3x |

## Decision Framework

### At $4.3M (7.7% of fund), SMB becomes a concentrated bet.

**This makes sense if:**
- You believe Sanofi closes (March catalyst)
- You believe JEPA is the right architecture for patient modeling
- You believe Kevin executes at top-decile level
- You want SMB to be a potential fund-returner (not just a solid 5-10x)

**This doesn't make sense if:**
- You're uncertain on Sanofi timing
- You want to preserve dry powder for other opportunities
- 7.7% concentration in pre-revenue feels too aggressive

---

## Key Catalysts to Monitor

### Near-term (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Sanofi $4.8M contract signature (March)
- [ ] Series A process outcome ($15-20M target)
- [ ] GSK meeting with Kim Branson

### Medium-term (Q2-Q3 2026)
- [ ] Second pharma customer ($5M+)
- [ ] IQVIA $44M proposal progression
- [ ] AstraZeneca formal partnership

### Long-term (2027+)
- [ ] $50M+ ARR milestone
- [ ] Clinical validation studies
- [ ] Strategic acquisition interest

## Bottom Line

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Position size** | $4.3M (7.7% of fund) |
| **Entry valuation** | $28.4M effective |
| **Expected value** | ~$85.4M (~20x) |
| **Base case** | $27.2M (6.3x) |
| **Upside case** | $189M-$909M (44-211x) |
| **Max downside** | -$4.3M (-7.7% of fund) |

**At $4.3M, SMB becomes a "make the fund" bet.** The expected value (~20x) is attractive. The tail outcomes ($10-15B) are plausible given comps. The downside (-7.7%) is painful but not fatal.

**The key variable is conviction on the March Sanofi catalyst.** If that closes, this position looks brilliant. If it slips 6+ months, you've doubled down before de-risking.
