### Standard Model Bio Follow-Up Investment

- Continuing previous discussion about financing options for Standard Model Bio
- Two primary paths: raise now vs. wait for stronger position with Sanofi deal
- Kevin decided to move forward with additional funding
	- Accelerate 18-month plan to 9 months
	- Immediate hiring and team expansion
	- Not runway extension but investment acceleration

### Investment Terms Discussion

- Funding amount range: $1.5M - $2.5M
- Dilution target discussion
	- Kevin initially preferred 4% dilution at $2.25M
	- Virtue proposed 5% as compromise
	- Valuation cap negotiation from low 30s to final agreement
- Final agreed terms
	- $2.5M investment at $35M valuation cap
	- ~5.1% dilution ($1.935M from Virtue + potential $0.5M additional)
	- Doubling Virtue’s previous $1.8M investment
- Context considerations
	- Previous round at $22.5M cap just 4-5 months ago
	- No Sanofi commercial deal completed yet
	- Strong progress on AstraZeneca partnership exceeded expectations

### Strategic Positioning

- Series A preparation strategy
	- Target $30-50M Series A (not typical $15-20M)
	- Aim for 12-15% dilution vs market standard 25-30%
	- Position for competitive round with multiple Sanofi-style deals
- Company efficiency metrics
	- Total raised: $2.8M architect + ~$5M total through seed rounds
	- Exceptional capital efficiency relative to progress achieved
- Virtue’s confidence signal
	- Highest percent allocation relative to fund size
	- Doubling down 4-5 months post-initial investment
	- Recognition of generational company potential

### Next Steps

- Virtue to draft term sheet using previous round language
- Updated dates and numbers only, no structural changes
- Kevin to decide on additional $0.5M allocation (optional)
- Kevin mentioned potential small checks from Dave Messina (Pioneer) and Mo (Sunflowers) but not prioritizing until post-Sanofi
