We want to support you by formalizing GTM strategy and tapping into our network to rapidly scale revenue over the next 12-24 months. We’ve worked with 25+ companies at Virtue at this exact stage threading the needle between GTM scale and continued product development / prioritization, but our thoughts specifically for Dart Health below. If you want to hear directly from our founders on how we’ve supported them in similar ways in the past, then we would be happy to share founder references!

We can share more on all these lessons learned below, but oftentimes, the biggest value is joining the Virtue community of healthcare founders to hear directly from some of the leading early-stage founders in healthcare and share best practices on how they navigated these same considerations.

GTM/Commercial Strategy

Reducing Sales Cycle. We’ve seen the typical sales cycle shorten for health systems from the typical 18-24 months to 3-6 months (and in some cases weeks). We’ve seen similar compression in SMB providers like home health.

SmarterDx, for example, required no EMR integration and performed a historical audit on the last 3 years of data to show how much more money health systems would’ve made if they had used SmarterDx.

Translucent, another portfolio company, also employs manual uploads initially w/o full integration to show value, and then land and expands with agents across different service lines priced per agent.

For Dart, we’d love to take these lessons and more to shorten sales cycles (historical audit or similar approach), reduce the time to ROI (build process/excellence around integration), and be thoughtful about land-and-expand (where to start and why, what custom models to prioritize next, etc).

Business model to capture value. Once you’ve optimized the sales cycle/GTM, how do we structure the business model / pricing to ensure we are capturing the appropriate % of value we are providing to customers? This will continue to evolve over the next 1-2 years given the rise of point solutions, commoditization of tech behind those point solutions, and how Dart can position itself as a more comprehensive platform. For example, you’re selling multiple models to a health system. For 1 model, ROI might be more straightforward and attributable so you could theoretically charge a contingency fee but for another model a platform/SaaS fee makes more sense. How do we back into a platform pricing model to set ourselves up for land-and-expand over time? SmarterDx dealt with similar dynamics as the contingency fee they charged in year 1 changed in year 2/3 as benchmark comparisons evolved. Dart X also provides a whole separate opportunity on top of the core clinical use cases as customers look to fine-tuned models to solve for the last 20% of complexity. We’ve seen examples of companies selling fine-tuned models for 6/7-figures to pharma, where pharma provides data, pays for compute, and lets the startup keep the model weights to sell models to other customers. This requires nuance around selling on a service/project basis with some education on data privacy, but margins and ultimate value can be very attractive.

Customer intros

Health systems. We have direct connections in the health system market (Multicare, TGH, UT Southwestern, Kaiser, Cedars, etc) that we’d like to leverage. While making these intros is straightforward, the important piece is making the right intro to the right person at the right time while helping with prioritization (target small/mid-sized before expanding to AMCs).

Post-acute. In post-acute, we think there's an interesting opportunity to leverage other vendors/conveners to drive scale more efficiently than going agency by agency. For example, John Driscoll (former CEO @ CareCentrix) has tentacles throughout the entire home health ecosystem with CareCentrix touching 20m+ lives. We’d love to get you more connected into the Nashville scene where folks at CareBridge, NaviHealth, etc similarly have tentacles throughout the PAC ecosystem. Resmed acquired BrightTree + MatrixCare, which gives them massive reach, and could be an interesting avenue. We also have more direct avenues to larger players (Bayada) or MSOs (OneHome; acquired by Humana) that touch multiple agencies.

Government. We have friends from Palantir in particular that have experience working with government contracts (mostly HHS) to better understand the context, timing, and positioning of certain RFPs within broader political dynamics that are unspoken. This can be a valuable source of non-dilutive capital if done right, especially in today’s environment.

Hiring

PAC Hires. Leveraging similar connections as mentioned above in BD intros but being strategic about working tops-down and bottoms-up to find the right hire. Tops-down, working with the Jay Desai’s and John Driscoll’s of the world to align on strategy (comp structure, skillsets, specific individuals, etc) of who to hire. Beyond that, we’d love to tap into our network to intro and help recruit folks in NYC (Dave, Eric, Rawan, etc) who have the rolodex in post-acute care, and complementing that with high-quality sales hires from other high-growth companies in NYC (Zocdoc, Quartet, Flatiron, etc) who are looking for their next role.

Gov Hires. We are well connected in these circles within HHS (Abe Sutton, Chris Klomp, Jacob Schiff, etc), other policy folks (Jacob Meyer), and current Palantir folks/alums who have actually gone through these sales cycles (Nabeel). I’d be curious to get more of your thinking here on the exact archetype because it varies widely (ex-Palantir vs. DC policy type)
