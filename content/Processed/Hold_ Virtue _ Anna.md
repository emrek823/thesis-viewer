### Blueprint Health Overview - AI-Native Company Creation Platform

- Vision: Build world’s leading AI-native company creation platform focused on healthcare
- Three main pillars:
	- Exceptional talent
	- Proven playbooks
	- AI-native clinical and operational infrastructure
- Strategy: Scale Anna’s 1-5 billion dollar opportunity into 10 similar companies, each reinforced by learnings from previous
- Transforms healthcare services margin profile from 25% to 40%+ through AI implementation

### Background and Experience

- Aimun’s healthcare background:
	- Parents built and operated Centerpoint behavioral health system for 25 years (sold to Acadia in 2021)
	- Brother started One Doc Way (telebehavioral), sold to Geno Pharmaceuticals
	- Personal experience at AAA Partners as GM of company creation
- AAA Partners track record:
	- Built companies with $5M balance sheet capital that transacted for $1B+ each
	- Portfolio sitting at $5-7B total value (2 realized exits, others approaching $1B each)
	- Created scalable playbooks across healthcare services business creation

### Anna Business Model and Traction

- Clinical innovation: NDBI (Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions) vs traditional ABA
	- Traditional ABA: 50-year-old model based on discrete trials training, adult-led, rigid
	- NDBI approach: Child-led, natural environment, play-based, incorporates parents
- Financial performance:
	- First center: Profitable in 4 months with <$60K investment, generating $1M annualized profit (19x ROI)
	- Wayland location: 0 to $1.6M ARR in 6 months
	- Westford: 5 full-day clients secured before opening (breakeven at 6 clients)
- Massachusetts market expansion:
	- 8 locations secured, 4 open, 1 in construction, 3 LOIs signed
	- $40M top-line ARR potential, $16M pro forma contribution profit
	- Functionally profitable on run-rate basis today

### AI Implementation Strategy

- Buy vs build decision framework for AI tools:
	- Dynamic scheduling - built internally, machine learning-driven automated scheduler
	- Automated RCM - procured through Silma, fully automated prior auth and eligibility
	- AI Scribe and documentation - combination build/buy approach
	- Blueprint AI treatment plan generator - built from ground up
	- Lucent AI clinical decision support - built internally
- Economic impact: Each tool drives incremental value, stacking for greater unit-level efficiency
- Unified data ontology: Centralized platform enabling massive scale support with higher margins

### Market Expansion and Timeline

- Current expansion pipeline:
	- Washington State: Already licensed and contracted
	- Arizona and Indiana: Licensed, actively contracting
	- Minnesota and Missouri: Strategic acquisitions ($250-350K each) to accelerate market entry
- Timeline considerations:
	- Blueprint implementation: At least 12+ months before starting new businesses
	- Resource allocation strategy: Start foundational work while scaling Anna
	- Market entry process: Parallel licensing, contracting, GM recruitment, real estate identification

### Blueprint Vision and Next Steps

- Target outcome: Transform from $1-2B Anna opportunity to $10B+ Blueprint portfolio
- Core team structure:
	- Investor in residence for diligence and financial modeling
	- CEO in training for zero-to-one operations
	- Forward deployed engineer for AI chassis customization
	- CEO in residence for scaled multi-site leadership
- Three potential operating companies identified:
