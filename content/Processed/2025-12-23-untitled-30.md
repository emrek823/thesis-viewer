| |  | | --- | | congressHospitals are scrambling on Senate GOP bill Rural hospital APRogelio V. Solis/AP The Senate version of President Trump’s tax-cut bill would slash Medicaid enrollment and funding even more than the House version. Hospitals — which stand to lose hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade — now are lobbying heavily to stop the Senate version from moving forward, my colleagues [Daniel Payne and John Wilkerson report](https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/20/trump-tax-bill-hospital-lobbyists-warn-senate-budget-writers-dire-impact-rural-health-care/?utm_campaign=health_care_inc&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tcnLZ4rSZPScafDZ5KFSjJUMuvi_s1Wh1uYz3BcZpGd836SY_U2PHFULSpEPZiWlIt92sKeU7gqsmO9VQ8E5AtAPyiA).  In the House bill, Republicans were less harsh on Medicaid provider taxes, which is a financial maneuver to draw down more federal money for hospitals. The House bill also would grandfather “state directed payment arrangements,” [another lucrative mechanism](https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/13/medicaid-state-directed-payments-9-billion-supplemental-funds-hospitals-doctors-nursing-homes/?utm_campaign=health_care_inc&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tcnLZ4rSZPScafDZ5KFSjJUMuvi_s1Wh1uYz3BcZpGd836SY_U2PHFULSpEPZiWlIt92sKeU7gqsmO9VQ8E5AtAPyiA) that has allowed hospitals to get paid a lot more for treating Medicaid patients.  The Senate bill would take a bigger hatchet to those hospital funds. Two hospital lobbyists involved in congressional meetings told Daniel and John they believe enough Senate Republicans are uncomfortable with the bill in its current form that it will ultimately change, even with additional funding for rural hospitals.   A large irony in all of this: Even if hospitals get lawmakers to sign onto the House version, millions of people still would lose their health insurance. But hospitals’ revenue would be a bit more protected.

My colleague Tara Bannow spotted a [new filing](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25979501-calpers-v-unitedhealth-group-semler-filing/?utm_campaign=health_care_inc&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tcnLZ4rSZPScafDZ5KFSjJUMuvi_s1Wh1uYz3BcZpGd836SY_U2PHFULSpEPZiWlIt92sKeU7gqsmO9VQ8E5AtAPyiA) in the case: CalPERS has served the medical device firm Semler Scientific with a “preservation subpoena” so the company keeps documents that CalPERS believes may help its case.  CalPERS wants all the information between Semler and the Department of Justice, which has [investigated Semler](https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/16/semler-scientific-quantaflo-unitedhealth-group-peripheral-artery-disease-doj-settle/?utm_campaign=health_care_inc&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tcnLZ4rSZPScafDZ5KFSjJUMuvi_s1Wh1uYz3BcZpGd836SY_U2PHFULSpEPZiWlIt92sKeU7gqsmO9VQ8E5AtAPyiA) for potential fraud claims. But it also wants “all documents and communications with UnitedHealth concerning the QuantaFlo device,” according to a [separate legal filing](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25979725-calpers-v-unitedhealth-group-semler-documents-to-preserve/?utm_campaign=health_care_inc&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tcnLZ4rSZPScafDZ5KFSjJUMuvi_s1Wh1uYz3BcZpGd836SY_U2PHFULSpEPZiWlIt92sKeU7gqsmO9VQ8E5AtAPyiA). That includes how many QuantaFlo devices UnitedHealth bought or rented from Semler, how UnitedHealth intended to use the device, and “communications with UnitedHealth concerning the DOJ investigation.”   Here’s a small teaser: Watch our website this week, or follow me on social media for updates. My colleagues and I will be publishing a story that dives deep into Semler — a company that had pledged to detect artery disease early, but now has pivoted to cryptocurrency speculation after Medicare’s multibillion-dollar pot of money dried up. [Here’s our story from last year](https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/07/unitedhealth-peripheral-artery-disease-screening-program-medicare-advantage-gold-mine/?utm_campaign=health_care_inc&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tcnLZ4rSZPScafDZ5KFSjJUMuvi_s1Wh1uYz3BcZpGd836SY_U2PHFULSpEPZiWlIt92sKeU7gqsmO9VQ8E5AtAPyiA) on the ties between Semler and UnitedHealth.   ---  medicare advantageThe high commission CMS announced [updated 2026 commissions](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25979525-cms-memo-61825-medicare-advantage-broker-commissions/?utm_campaign=health_care_inc&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tcnLZ4rSZPScafDZ5KFSjJUMuvi_s1Wh1uYz3BcZpGd836SY_U2PHFULSpEPZiWlIt92sKeU7gqsmO9VQ8E5AtAPyiA) for Medicare brokers, and those who steer people into Medicare Advantage plans are going to get a big raise.  Agents and brokers will get $694 for signing up new Medicare Advantage enrollees and $347 for renewing people’s plans — both are 11% higher than 2025 commissions. Agents and brokers will get $114 for helping new traditional Medicare enrollees pick a prescription drug plan and $57 for renewing someone’s Medicare drug plan — just 5% and 4% higher than this year’s rates.   What does this mean? Brokers again will have major financial incentives to herd people into MA plans, even if those plans may not be the best fit for those Medicare beneficiaries. | |
