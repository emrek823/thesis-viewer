### Background & Prior Work at Village

- Jen previously ran actuary and analytics functions at Village
- Worked with Daniel on rebuilding high-risk predictive model combining claims data and real-time hospital admission data
- Led replatforming initiative to DBT and Snowflake cloud-based enablement
- Analytics/model deployment ownership evolved into finance role after demonstrating forecasting capabilities
- Managed integration of Summit multi-specialty group with Village’s risk-based primary care model

### Strategic Healthcare Insights

- Primary care only controls 7-8% of total cost of care, even in high-performing practices
- Patient decisions often occur outside primary care scope
- Specialty care varies significantly by type (e.g., neurology, oncology becoming care quarterbacks)
- Analytics becomes more strategic when embedded in finance rather than operations
- Need to align incentives across fee-for-service and value-based care models

### Consumer Healthcare Perspectives

- Increasing consumer-driven healthcare decisions happening outside traditional medical channels
- Challenges around balancing consumer digital experience with operational/administrative requirements
- Cost considerations for startups delivering consumer experiences while managing healthcare operations
- Growing consumer interest in functional medicine and longevity services

### Next Steps

- Schedule 30-minute follow-up to discuss specific addiction healthcare business opportunity
- Explore potential collaboration opportunities in behavioral health space
- Share relevant portfolio companies and founders for mutual benefit
- Continue dialogue around specialty care integration models
