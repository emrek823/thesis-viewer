### Private Equity Strategy & Market Position

- PE not touching businesses doing $5M or less in revenue
	- Threshold extends to 1-10M revenue businesses depending on margin profile
	- Huge opportunity for tech-enabled M&A in underserved segment
- High velocity M&A motion planned
	- Tech integrates quickly with acquired business stacks
	- Roll up ambitious “too early to be sold” businesses historically ignored by PE
- Next $100M targeting 1-10M revenue businesses
	- Future rounds will target 10-25M revenue businesses
	- Building brokerage transformation machine (operations + technology)

### Product Development & Technology Integration

- Application-first approach for speed of integration
	- Solving discrete problems at use case level initially
	- Platform development on staggered basis over time
- Three core problems creating economic value for agencies
	- Applications integrated immediately for Year 1 value creation
	- Migration to integrated platform over time for efficiency gains
- Agency contracting and commissions module still needs development
	- Critical differentiator that gets everyone excited
	- Holy Grail: one platform to run entire business
	- Consolidates 5-10 different platforms agencies currently use

### M&A Sourcing & Deal Pipeline

- Four M&A sourcing channels being developed:
	- Self-source outbound (SMB software motion to agencies)
	- Personal networks (existing Rolodex)
	- Referral channels (advisors, partners, influencers - $10K if deal closes)
	- Advisory channels (more mature referrals, higher multiples)
- Current deal targets for next 30 days
	- Avid and Benefits & Care strongest profile fits
	- Benefits & Care Houston onsite Wednesday next week
	- Need alignment on long-term deal value vs current payment
- Team building priorities
	- Engineering pipeline solid, potential hire of Glick after dinner meeting
	- Head of M&A role still under consideration (Chicago candidate eliminated due to non-compete)
	- Focus on sourcing capability most critical
