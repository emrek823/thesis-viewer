# Hermes Health
The Rails for Identified Health Data
1

# The Team & Founder
CEO & Founder: Alejandro Zamorano
I've spent the last 15 years at the ground floor of building the rails
for health data movement at Datavant, PainQx, and Life Science
Nation.

I understand data movement and the ecosystem.

• Spearhead record retrieval solutions for life sciences at Datavant
(2024 to 2025).

• Led Datavant's Life Sciences vertical, scaled revenue from
inception (2019 to 2024).

• PainQx - 1st Employee (2015 to 2019)

Life Science Nation - Founder (2012 to 2015)

Identified Data: $150 to $300 per patient

• Enables direct patient-level action
• Clear provenance
• Clearly measurable ROI
• Rich data profile

De-Identified Data: $0.01 to $10 per patient

• Limited to population analysis
• Unclear provenance
• Hard to measure outcomes
• Limited data profile

# Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past
Access to Identified Data is Fragmented, Full of Friction, and Labor Intensive
The Problem
HIEs and TEFCA were designed to enable seamless health
data exchange but in practice, its made it worse. Access to
identified data is still full of friction:
• Fragmentation: 1,000+ data custodians with limited
footprint and coverage.
• Multiple Connections: Requestors need multiple data
sources to meet their needs.
• Friction: Labor cost of $100 to pull one medical record
• Confusion: Varying channels to get medical records
(fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs).

# Network Effect & Value
Hermes Provides Value to Both the Requestor and the Custodian – Creating a Reinforcing Flywheel effect.

| Faster Turnaround: More Revenue Data comes back in minutes instead of weeks                                                                                                              | More Demand → More Revenue: Hermes expands your digital intake funnel, making it easy for requestors to submit and receive records driving higher volume and revenue.                                                                                       |
| More Data: More Revenue More data enables Requestors to unlock new markets and use cases.                                                                                             | One API → Lower Cost: Hermes handles all requestor integrations through a single API, removing one-off builds and manual fax work to cut engineering and labor costs.                                                                                   |
| Less Overhead: One API to submit and retrieve identified health data no more bespoke connections, integrations, and maintenance.                                                       | Rules Based Routing → Enforce Compliance: Custodians set which request types they accept, and Hermes enforces those rules automatically for example, blocking malpractice requests.                                                                  |

# Business Model
We have a Simple Business Model that Scales as our Network Grows.

Business Model

• Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
• Hermes pays the Custodian on a per record
or patient basis based on the dataset.
• Gross margin is the spread between what we
charge Requestors and what Custodians
charge us.
• As automation and network density grow,
gross margins expand.

| Category                  | Price                | Gross Margin |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Annual Platform           | $10,000 to $100,000 | 90%          |
| Record Request (End to End) | $50 Per Record       | 20%          |
| Record Request (Routing)  | $5 Per Record        | 80%          |
| Site Sonar                | $15 Per Patient       | 66%          |
| RX + Medical Claims       | $50 Per Patient       | 50%          |

# Strategic Vision & Goals
To Win the Network we Must Execute on the Strategic Goals Below.
Confidential
Phase 1: Relevance
Build Atomic Network
Build the smallest minimum
viable network to validate
requestor and custodian
interest
Phase 2: Ubiquity
Achieve Requestor and
Custodian Ubiquity
Use the momentum to create
network to create a
self-reinforcing flywheel effect
and gravitational pull.
Phase 3: Scale
Expand to New Markets
Phase 4: Monetize
Unlock New Use
Cases
Use the network density to
expand into more markets.
We are Here

# MOAT
Hermes Health's Moat = Network Density × Neutrality × Economies of Scale × Product Velocity

Connection Density
More Custodian connections mean fewer reasons for Requestors to
build their own. Each reinforces the Network.

Neutrality
We don't compete with Custodians or our Requestors. Our Neutrality
builds trust and drives adoption. Our Neutrality is our Superpower.

Economies of Scale
More volume allows us to negotiate lower Custodian fees, enabling
us to pass these savings to our Requestors.

Products Velocity
Our workflow innovations make data exchange seamless for
Custodians and Requestors. This speed lets us outperform Networks
of similar size with slower product cycles.

# Why Now?
The De-Identified Data Market Created Comfort and Now to Grow is Expanding to Identified Use Cases
Confidential
Custodians
• Built comfort exchanging de-identified data
data across 1,000+ sources
• De-identified market however is mature and
becoming commoditized
Requestors
Largely unaware that health data can be traded
or licensed
• Still rely on fax and manual workflows
• Few know how to license or value health data
• Growth pressure is creating push for new
markets and use cases
• Lack technical, operational, and legal knowledge
to implement and integrate with Custodians
• Limited knowledge of use cases that require
identified health data (this was intentional as
cultural norm)
• Early APIs from Epic, Athena, Office Ally,
Waystar are starting to create data liquidity
•
Al agents are accelerating the need for compliant
access to identified health data.
