Introductions and Backgrounds

Managed North American cold chain shipments and transitioning to trade compliance in April 2023.

### Cold Chain Logistics Insights

Past Methods: J&J used temp tails (passive temperature monitoring devices), which were limited to post-delivery analysis.

Modern Tech: GPS-enabled devices with temperature monitoring were implemented during the pandemic, especially for vaccine shipments. These provide real-time visibility but are limited by external factors like transportation mode.

Dedicated Fleet: J&J adopted dual-reefer trailers to mitigate risks of mechanical failures, significantly reducing potential losses from product spoilage.

Control Towers: Managed by Kuehne-Nagel, these systems integrate shipment monitoring but may rely on fragmented vendor solutions.

### Vendor Landscape and Software Use

KP asked about vendor platforms for real-time tracking and data integration.

He mentioned historical experiments with vendors like Project 44 and TransVoyant, noting mixed success.

Felipe Tosudi was suggested as a point of contact for detailed insights into J&J’s control tower operations.

### Pain Points in Cold Chain Visibility

Delivery Challenges: Issues with time-sensitive cooler shipments led to reliance on UPS’s automated systems, while FedEx struggled with tracking.

AI Opportunities: Potential to predict delivery failures and intervene preemptively.

Root Cause Analysis: Can take weeks, highlighting the need for improved quality management systems.

### Compliance and Regulatory Challenges

Focus on ensuring proper data and documentation for import/export processes, especially for non-commercial shipments like R&D and clinical products.

Pain points included delayed classification of products and coordination with multiple regulatory agencies (e.g., FDA, CBP).

He highlighted the importance of preventative measures to address compliance issues upstream.

### Regulations and Tariffs

New tariffs and sanctions significantly impact raw material and finished goods costs.

Compliance involves managing licenses for controlled products and adhering to international trade rules.

### Closing Remarks

KP shared their broader interest in understanding the cold chain and biologics supply chain, partly due to prior experience in drug discovery.

He provided additional contacts for further exploration and emphasized that his insights were based on past experiences.

KP:The problem. um so I guess if if helpful I can jump in on a little background, um I'm not sure how much Artie shared, but, um basically data designed scientist by by training and have really been kind of in the health care and life scien space for a while and and got really interested in researching this supply chain logist space.

KP:, but like high level would love to love to start off to get kind of your background for for your role and within the organization. and kind of what the what the scope of supply chain logistics was within that more broadly and particularly maybe within cold chain as well.

J:Okay. Sure, yeah, I can just do a quick uh quick, quick overview. Um, I used to have transportation, um until uh April of 2023.  So, and I had it for about six years, North America transportation. So during that time, I had consumer pharmaceutical med device, all transportation inside and outside of North America, in and inad now our customers. And so that's when I was actively responsible, accountable for a lot of cult chain shipments of every mode, you know, air, uh um truck, uh, you know, uh, small partial, coolers, you know, you name it.  It was like every possible product that needed to be maintained that, you know, whatever the there was like three different, you know, uh, temperatures or or ranges that we need to to maintain. And then in April of 2023, I moved on to trade complaints. So for the last uh 18 months, almost two years coming up, I've been focused on just import and export complaints.  So I don't really deal with coldchain anymore, but certainly have had that in my past uh when I was working in in transportation. So, um but I work closely with the uh transportation team still. We're kind of a handoff, right?  They managed the getting into the border. We managed the export entries. In some cases, if it's coming into the US, you know, then it moves across, you know, the ocean, we then do the import entry and then they do the final mile delivery to our DC who are manufacturing plants in some cases.  So we still work very closely together. There's two main groups, uh, um there's the domestic transportation, and then there's the interregional transportation. That's been in place now since about 2018, where we've really built up a separate group that does all ocean and air because it's a specialty and we've built a control tower.  We're using uh third party provider called Kuehne-nagel. and we're using our gateway technology to basically tender shipments to Kuehne-nagel with the requirements of what is needed for that shipment and then they go in and tender to the carrier, making sure that they arrive on time delivered on time all the night cut up and thenate bay happens after that. So and then before that, uh I spententy uh years, uh 15 years, roughly, uh in IT. So, uh, I worked across all three of the sectors, consumer pharmaceutical med device and implementing SAP, specifically in the deliver space, so order to cash, order creating orders, dropping deliveries, invoicing customers, pricing, rebates, everything from the moment an order is created until the moment we pay the customer, uh or the moment we send the in which to the customer and and technically receiving cash is on the finance ends, we hand it off to a finance at that point.  So, yeah, so for for those 15 years, I've supported not just SAP, but like, any of the systems that we used warehouse management, transportation management, EDI, portals, like anything involved in, again, the whole liver processes. So I forgot quite a bit of experience in deliver.

KP:That's a super awesome background, and it sounds like I'm talking to the right guy. um for for my questions for sure.  Um I think touched on it a little broadly right there. um but like what what does that co chain logistics work flow from like a visibility standpoint look like for Jjay? Because what I've been seeing and like the research and literature out there is that having real time and visibility across the landscape and tracking things like a chain of custody, uh across the whole end to end supply chain for for and kind of dealing with what what are those like additionally, what are those like key considerations, whether it's like the temperature control you touched on, delays, working with these other three PL's or three PLs and kind of the LSP's within that. What is that what does that broad visibility landscape look like for Jane J right now?  and specifically kind of within the coldchain area as well? 

J: Yeah, it's an interesting question. I I don't I haven't kept up in the last 18 months, but I can tell you that there were some initiatives that were kicked off and it's and it's all about the uh the monitoring, right?  It's all about the devices that we use. We know we have these temp tails and they're very passive. It's one of those things where you know and this is very old fashioned.  So before some of the more modern tools around visibility, uh tem tales were the go to standard, and all it meant was that when you shipped something in coldchain, that that shipment had attempt tail, often attached to a pallet, uh, you know, especially if you're talking about a container that was under temperature control, then every palate would have a tempt tail. But uh and often many cases, when you're shipping coine, it could just be you're shipping um, you know, a a a cooler or um, you know, but then again, in some cases, if you got a shipping a truck load, uh there there are there, I think there are certain instances where um, you know, there there's temp tails, you know, maybe just one temptail for the shipment. But whatever the case, maybe temptails was the old-fashioned, old standard, which was, you put a temp tail on the container, the container shows up at the destination, and then someone from J reads the tem to say, was there ever any time when that product was out of spec Very, very old-fashioned and very passive because you only know that there was a problem once the product was received and technically that's too late.  So I forget the name of the devices that were implemented a few years ago, um, and I don't even know if they're still in play, but the technology exists out there for you to have a a GPS device that tracks the shipment and that theme device can also it's really technically more of a starts as a temp tail or it starts as a temperature monitoring device, but it also has GPS capability. And I believe it's still in play because we actually created this for the pandemic for when we were building the the the uh um what do you call it, the uh the vaccine. So this really became popular and I think we even had an offshore team.  I could direct you to the right folks that know this pretty well, but uh I believe we even created an offshore team that did the monitoring for us. that not only tracked where the shipment was going, but they could see at any point in time if that shipment was going out of temperature range. Now, the problem is is that there's only so much you can do. If that shipment is on a a barge, you know, you may not have that much flexibility to be able to do much about that.  If that shipment is on the rail, you know, you might, if that rail car somehow is without power or you might be able to notify someone. So it's a little bit more active, but the challenge is still, can you do anything about that? One of our biggest challenges has always been shipping out of Puerto Rico, and we have a lot of pharmaceutical products and even other coal chain shipments that have come out of Puerto Rico.  And, you know, it's so bloody hot down there that we always had problems when products got staged to go on to the plane uh or even onto the uh onto the ship that uh it would get staged, uh, you know, basically with a tarp on it. And that wasn't sufficient. They've improved a lot of the supply chain flow down in Puerto Rico so that things move very quickly from the truck that delivered it to the port or to the terminal to the inside storage until they're ready to actually load that onto the truck or onto the barge.  So um but there is always that risk and um and and a lot of times what you're dealing with is also uh not just uh, you know, uh tarps, but you actually have products inside of a storage unit, like one of those, I forget what they call them, there's a it's been a couple yeah, it's been a couple years, but they've got these uh they look like massive refrigerators that can fit a pallet and and a lot of our products that are very sensitive uh have no exposure to the outside air. They they basically get loaded into one of those containers and then they, you know, ship in those containers all the way through until the destination. But even with those, you can have these devices which can withstand the cold temperatures, you can have GPS, uh you can have temperature monitoring, you can have humidity monitoring, um and this could all be visible on a controlled tower type of screen.

KP:Amazing that control tower front so what is what is kind of the software and vendor landscape for for J&J visibility and like the broader, broader kind of real time tracking for a supply chain transport, whether it is like it sounds like there is like an internal control tower build, but then also like do you is there like a holistic platform that brings in like the control in data from kind of the hardware that is dealing with the ultra cold temperature like biologics and kind of vaccines from that perspective. But then also integrating in all of these different kind of data systems. Or are they kind of like different vendors and what what does that vendor landscape look like?  Because it seems super fragmented from my research.

J: Yeah, that's a great question. I don't I haven't kept up because it's been a couple of years I know they've the person to connect with would be Felipe Tusudi. he's the director of the control tower nail. um and that's what kuehne-nage is basically running the control tower for us. uh and and I I think it's it's it's not just the tendering, but I think it's also the active monitoring of those shipments. I just don't know if it includes culting monitoring. But he would be the one to talk to uh for that. Yeah, I can put it in the one second.  I go. Yep, we paid to city.

KP: Yeah.  Amazing. No, that that makes a lot of sense, and I appreciate. I appreciate it. um I know, I know kind of, uh you you've uh it's kind of tricky now being being uh with trying to remember back from from two years ago. um I think like the the other thing was like, do you recall any um like key pain points you were experiencing with cult chain visibility, either like internally or externally with vendors, like some things that you could ah, you wish you could get it could get fixed potentially with like software novel tech, especially kind of now in this AI era.

J: Well one big change that we made and this was for Pharma because that's where the majority of our coal chain products were um we uh we went to a dedicated fleet and again, this this started with the pandemic, actually, but it became the gold standard for us. Not only did we go to a dedicated fleet, but we went to a dedicated fleet with dual reefers. So if one reefer went down, if one of your units, if the if the unit went down, there's a backup unit on the trailer.  That became a game changer for us because the pain point that we had before that was that, um if for whatever reason, there's a mechanical failure on that co chain unit, especially on these trucks inbound to DC and even up down the customer, you're talking about hundreds of uh in some cases, uh tens of millions of dollars at risk, you know, in a given week we could chip, you know, a half a billion dollars a product. And that's just outound the customer. So there's there's all these risks that we have um associated with uh these, uh the transportation of cultene products.  That really got eliminated um when we went to these dual reefers and dedicated carriers, and it was one of those things that's like as you can imagine, um every year we're asked to generate cost savings for the business and transportation is a huge expense. So in prior years, you know, we didn't have a dedicated fleet. We didn't have two reefers.  We, you know, we didn't, you know, we were always looking to uh save money when in reality, the risk wasn't worth it. So that was one of the things. Now the other thing was, um, I'll just talk about like cooler shipments to customers, uh, you know, we we um we had a program we fill up a program with UPS where by the coolers have to be delivered within 48 hours.  And if and I think this is somewhere where, you know, AI could probably come into play, um if if those coolers were not able to be delivered within 48 hours, we had to automatically send them back and destroy the product. And so, uh we relied on UPS because that was our primary supplier at the time out of uh uh Kentucky, uh, where we do most of our cooler shipments. And so, uh, they had a system in place that could trigger whether or not that was going to be received within 48 hours.  I can also tell you that there's FedEx for Medec that um out of Memphis, now, they didn't have as sophisticated system, and um there were many times where we are, you know, calling their uh, their their service cent to say, hey, this hasn't been delivered yet. It's about to expire. You need to stop it.  And and a many times they couldn't even stop it. It was already in the truck with the driver and to get in touch with the exact driver was difficult and then you're at risk of delivering product that is out of out of spec. So those were some of the pain points I know a couple of years ago. um um and so uh, you know, I think that's where, you know, you you could have not only temper control, but even AI understanding, okay, what is the likelihood that this is actually going to ri on time or doesn't need to be turned around and get back to, you know, to the shipping site?

KP: now kind of being on kind of the the border side of things in and kind of think about that compliance angle, how has kind of what your how is your focal point like shifted versus like what you think how you think about the lens of like supply chain logistics and and kind of the hand offset I think you touched on initially.

J:Yeah. Yeah, ours it's process all about data.  Um, when we have a product show up at the border, um bunch paperwork that come along with that product, and there's already data in the government database to tell you what that product is for. And that that that that data's got a match. So most of our pain points our products show up and um there is certain amount of information on the paperwork, but then there are certain things that we do not rely on the paperwork for at all, and our brokers have to look up the classification of that material in our database.  And sometimes that there is no classification, and then we're scrambling to get a classification. And we have people on standby to help with those last minute classifications. And while we're doing this, product is either stuck or yeah, mainly it's just waiting because you can't clear an in you can't clear the border until you've got an import clearance from customers and Border Patrol.  So those are the situations we deal with now. um and then to be able to get that product classified, you need to get the information for that product and it's typically, you know, it's a scramble, what we've done is we've started to work upstream to say, you can't ship anything unless we've agreed that you've got all the information required not just the classification of that material in the right system that a progger going to use, but also uh all the different forms you need because it's it's it's not just one government agency. There are many products that come across the border that have to get clearby CBP, clearared by you FDA, clear by fishing wildlife, like depending upon the compound, depend upon the product itself, there are in some cases two, three or even four government agencies that have to sign off on us clearing an import. And so that's what we're doing a lot of times now, which is working up stream with our shippers to say, what are you shipping?  And based on what you're shipping, here's here's all the documents you need. Not only that, but go and fill and complete them and then we'll review them before you ship them. So that's what we call that's a prevent process, because it prevents the the border issues.  And so we that's a lot of what our focus is now and it's pred predominantly on the non-commercial lanes, because commercial lanes are finished goods which we've produced over and over and over again, and we know exactly what shipping, we know the classification of material, we know that the data points that got to get along into the government database. What we're really challenged with is all the noncommercial shipping. So you're talking about R&D products, clinical products, and that's where we've put into the process these prevent things where, you know, we're basically holding up a shipment from even leaving until everything's ready to go.

KP: That makes a ton touched on before kind of with the with the dual refers and then, like preferred LSPs or kind of three PLs, is so is there like a is there like a subset of what does that landscape look like? Is there, do you still work agnostically with kind of the LSPs and 3PLs that might provide the most coverage or is there like a preferred Jane J network now of just certain carrias like UPS that that Jane J exclusively works with?

J: Yeah, so it's very different by mode.  If you look at it know partial, you really only have a couple of choices. uh, you know, for for US domestic shipments, it's you it's UPS and FedEx. There are a couple of custom like critical uh, you know, like specialty services that we use, um uh, you know, if you're talking about air, you know, there's there's there's a a plethora of freight forwarders, but you know, we typically do our RFPs every two years. um, you know, we're we're trying to bounce uh quality as well as price, uh quality is very important because and we've worked with these carriers for years now. So we know which ones when there's a problem can do a a proper root calls analysis and corrective action, which ones struggle to do that, and that weighs heavily into our next RFP, where we're not going to be willing to sacrifice quality um and and and so, you know, but we do try to to maintain um carriers um we we try not to have too much uh turnover because a lot of that is that changed management as expensive.  You know, going to a new carrier, having to establish a new master services agreement, have a new establish new quality agreement, getting the protocols in place for shipping, you know, every one of these lanes goes through shi you know, um uh what they call lane verification. So, um yeah, we try of to have too much turnover um, but we use these, you know, RFPs to basically, you know, go through that process, uh, if we're gonna even maintain our current carries it would be to get a more competitive price, um Yeah, well, yeah, I got. No, I was gonna say, but the when we had consumer you know, that's when there was, you know, 50 to 60 truckload carriers.  And we didn't want to change 50 to 60 truckload carriers every two years. We would try to maintain at least 60% of the existing, maybe 70% of the existing carrier base, maybe change the mix of the lanes that they owned and and then we would start to incorporate some new carriers, you know, some mino own carriers, things like that. But other uh objectives there, you know, that we have when doing the RFPs.

KP:  And root cause analysis, um is that like is there is there a quick turnaround on that that you've seen? Because from what I've read in a lot of literature, sometimes like these can take up to up to seven days and, you know, hundreds of hundreds, if not tens of shipments could be effected in that period, curious if that's been something that you guys have been running into where that turnaround time is quite slow.

J: Yeah, yeah, no, it could take a very long time. much more than seven days. or sometimes we do root calls andalysis and it takes us weeks and months because the carriers don't have a good quality management system in place. um I don't think that they've put other shipment at risk, because a lot of these things are one off issues.  You know, there was there was something wrong with that specific equipment. There was something wrong with that specific shipment. um, you know, somebody may be made a mistake, but uh I haven't seen a situation where um multiple uh quality issues happen before you're able to, you know, go after the rootall of his specific. Because I think a lot of those times it's it's an isolated, you know, scenario of what went wrong.

KP: And do you guys use any software vendors like Project 44 um like I know control and has some software for for kind of their control temp um boxes and stuff like that, Are there or like kind of I think the other one is um is like airspace for some specialized shipments as well? Are there any like vendors that yell use, or is that kind of a lot of internal software built? well, there there is one for security uh that we use, especially for Pharma.

J: I forget the name of it, but there there is a vend and a service and a software that they use to monitor our shipments. um and then I again, I forget the names of the ones that we use for uh for co chain, but it may have changed since then. We we did some experiments with like a transvoyance software at one point in time. We did a pilot with them.  That wasn't that successful. um but there are, you know, Project 44 is a big one. uh there's a trying to think of the other one, but yeah, I'm not sure what we're using today.. Amaz. Yep.

KP: But I guess as like a final question um kind of thinking about the are there like one or two new regulations or uh upcoming regulations that are like top of mind for JJ today as you think about kind of um where supply chains going and how things with the biosecure Act may affect uh may affect that.

J: Yeah, that's a tough question. I mean, right now, my focus is Tr compliance, so it's a lot about, you know, the new tariffs that are coming out, uh with the Trump administration and um any type of sanctions that are going to be put, like we've spent a lot of the last couple of years working on sanctions, uh, and making sure that our our products are classified properly and if required, you know, we have to go after our license, get a license approved for the Bureau of Industries and securities. But I'm not as close as anything infecting, you know, like the actual um, you know, product quality or or yeah, um But yeah, I mean, everything that we ship everything we export, it's got to be classified, everything that's been classified, it's gotta be assessed against not only the BIS um license requirements, but also there's a a CD there's some they called a CDL.  I think it's the or it's some type of uh, you know, specially controlled list. uh or the CCL. um I think it's but it's it's it's a list of products that are basically, you know, you've got to make sure that uh there's there no matter where you're shipping, it's gotta have a license to ship.. That makes it sense.

KP: And how how are the tarrifs particularly affecting J&J right now?  Is that on like input costs for manufacturing, or is it across like more broadly of of kind of the external import base?

J:It just depends on what goes, you know, what actually get to put in the price, but yeah, when when this has happened before, you know, what are it steel or aluminum or whatever, it's it's gonna impactinn goods and raw materials, uh, so anything that comes in, it's gonna be, you know, paying higher taxes. Yeah. goes drugly into the cost could sold..  I appreciate you bearing with all my questions. This is super interesting space that that I'm like fascinated about and and kind of digging in more as as I kind of speak to more people in the space, but I really appreciate your time to. No problem. yeah, just don't quote me on anything just because I you know, uh you can certainly try to reach out the fleet Bay. um um but yeah, I I I turn out to have any type of uh uh sure anything sensitive, 100%.
