optimal health for all humans

## Slide 3: The Problem
The Problem
Current medical
system fails to support
proactive health

Most people live in a fog of fatigue and frustration,
navigating a healthcare system that treats
symptoms instead of unlocking human potential.

*   Preventive care is inaccessible and reactive
*   High cost and complexity of traditional medicine
*   Rapidly growing consumer demand for
    evidence-based optimization (not maintenance)
*   Fragmented solutions: consumers and providers
    lack a single trusted ecosystem

After years of post-concussion headaches and
countless failed treatments, Celia's

where I'd be without them.
