## Summary
The FDA is classifying the electrical tongue nerve stimulator for motor deficits as a Class II medical device, which means it requires special controls but faces a lower regulatory barrier than Class III devices. This classification suggests the FDA sees potential safety and effectiveness in the technology and wants to create a pathway for innovation while maintaining patient safety standards.

## Startup Angle
A neurotechnology startup focusing on neuromodulation for motor disorders could leverage this ruling. Specifically, a company developing non-invasive nerve stimulation therapies for conditions like cerebral palsy, stroke recovery, or movement disorders could use this regulatory clarity to accelerate product development. Companies like Neurolutions or Synchron working on brain-computer interfaces for motor rehabilitation would find this particularly relevant. The ruling reduces regulatory friction, potentially cutting months or years off their path to market.
