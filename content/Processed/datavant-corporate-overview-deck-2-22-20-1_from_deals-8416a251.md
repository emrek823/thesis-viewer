## Slide 3: Our Contentions

j
Our Contentions

1.  **Data fragmentation** is the biggest bottleneck to realizing the power of data and technology in healthcare
2.  Solving it requires a **health data network**
3.  To build the health data network, you must be **ubiquitous, privacy-centric, and neutral**

## Slide 10: How Datavant's Software Works: Protecting the Process

j
How Datavant's Software Works: Protecting the Process

*   One-way cryptographic hash ensures that **Datavant Patient Key cannot be reversed**
*   Site-specific encryption ensures that sites retain control over their Datavant Patient Keys and that **an incident at one site does not impact the rest of the ecosystem**
*   Cryptographic de-identification process has been **certified by leading HIPAA experts**

## Slide 11: Life of a Datavant Customer: SHYFT

j
Life of a Datavant Customer: SHYFT
a Medidata company

*   **Problem:**
    *   SHYFT offers medication adherence analysis for customers with specialty products
    *   Understanding adherence requires connecting specialty pharmacy data
*   **Datavant's Solution:**
    *   **De-identify:** Sources can only send data to SHYFT in de-identified form
    *   **Link:** SHYFT wants to understand which patients switch pharmacies (v. drop out), so Datavant tokenizes the de-identified source records so they are linkable

**De-identify and connect with Datavant**
(Flowchart showing 3 specialty pharmacies sending data through Datavant (d) to SHYFT, resulting in improved medication adherence tracking)
