# Take control of your health journey.

Kin takes notes during your doctor visits, tracks your care plan, and helps you and your loved ones follow through.

Limited Early Access

## Introducing Kin

We leave the doctor's office and immediately forget 80% of what was said. The instructions, the next steps, the nuances of our own health; they fade into anxiety and uncertainty.

We try to be good patients. We nod, we listen, maybe we scribble a few notes. But in the moment, we're too overwhelmed by everything happening to truly process what comes next. And even questions or concerns we planned to bring up - the ones we rehearsed on the drive over - disappear the second the visit starts. We trade understanding for survival, and when we get home, we're left with more questions than answers.

We’re taught to blame ourselves when we forget - as if caring more could somehow cut through the overload. That if we truly cared, we'd remember to take the pill, book the follow-up, or do the exercises.

But what if the problem wasn't you, but the system, and the tools you were given?

Introducing Kin: The memory layer for your health. Kin takes notes during your visits, understands your care plan, and helps you follow through while ensuring your loved ones stay updated in real-time.

Because information plus understanding equals empowerment.

Our vision is simple: A beautifully supported loop of clarity, where you're always prepared for the next visit, and fully supported in between. Where you never have to feel alone in your healthcare journey again.

It's time to stop just **visiting** the doctor, and to start mastering your health. Welcome to Kin: built by doctors, for you.
