## Slide 5: Slow patient recruitment causes delays in 80% of clinical trials.
Slow patient recruitment causes delays in 80% of clinical trials.

Only half the subjects in a typical randomized controlled trial receive the experimental medicine. The other half in the control arm receive a placebo and/or another currently available therapy.

**Clinical Trial Phases Overview**

| Phase      | Focus                   | Subjects            | Duration | Costs    |
| :--------- | :---------------------- | :------------------ | :------- | :------- |
| **Phase I**  | Safety                  | 100 healthy subjects | 1 year   | $7M      |
| **Phase II** | Efficacy                | 500 subjects        | 2 years  | $20M     |
| **Phase III**| Efficacy + Adverse Events | 3000 subjects       | 4 years  | $53M     |
| **Overall**|                         |                     |          | **<10% success** |

## Slide 6: The solution: Use AI to generate digital subjects and enroll them into control arms of clinical trials.

## Slide 7: $80B Market Opportunity
# $80B

Biopharma companies invest $80B in clinical trials each year, with little success. Digital subject data can potentially capture up to 50% of this market.

Better return on investment. Faster trials. More new medicines for patients.

## Slide 8: CROs and pharma are interested in external controls, but Unlearn is the only company creating digital subjects for clinical trials.

## Slide 9: AD Digital Twin Example
Here's an example clinical record for a digital subject with Alzheimer's Disease created by our DiGenesis™ platform.

When a digital subject is matched to a treated subject at baseline we call it a digital twin.

**AD Digital Twin Example**
*   **Age (years):** 69
*   **Sex:** Female
*   **Region:** Europe
*   **ApoE e4 Count:** 1
*   **Taking donepezil:** Yes
*   **Height (cm):** 160
