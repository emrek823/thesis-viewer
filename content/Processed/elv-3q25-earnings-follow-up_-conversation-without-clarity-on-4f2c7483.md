### ELV 3Q25 Earnings Follow Up: Conversation Without Clarity on 2026

Both management and investors would like to turn the page on a challenging 2025, which would shift the focus to 2026. Unfortunately, the commentary around 2026 earnings suggests continued headwinds and in our view, the message around 2026 EPS was less than clear. When delineating its 2026 "considerations,” the company spent more time on the potential headwinds than the potential positives for sure, though some of that appears to be due to prudence. There was a clear avoidance of setting a range for 2026, as Elevance didn't even set a directional baseline. The company spoke to a lower 2025 runrate than reported guidance as well as certain key headwinds, and perhaps a few key tailwinds.

Ultimately, the biggest clue was likely related to 2027 where Elevance expects "balanced earnings growth in 2027." On the call, there was continued follow up on the topic and it appeared that Elevance was indeed pointing to 2027 as a year where the contributions from the various segments and drivers of the business would be able to push enterprise EPS back into the long term growth algorithm that leads to EPS growth of at least 12%. We took that to mean that 2026 was clearly not consistent with the LT growth rate even when considering the restated baseline of $27 per share in 2025. We now expect stated 2026 EPS to come in slightly lower than 2025, where guidance remains approximately $30 per share. We also note that the 2027 consensus already implies growth of 13.1% and that is off a $29.90 baseline in 2026, which we are suggesting may prove aggressive.

As discussed in the note below, there are several moving pieces to the changes in 2026 EPS vs 2025. There is the obvious removal of $3 per share in favorable one time items this year. There is also an incremental investment at the enterprise level that will be a $1 per share headwind. The company spoke to at least 125bps of margin compression in Medicaid, which we size at close to $2.60 per share. Conversely, there are several positives including much better targeted HIX margins (even off a lower revenue base) and expected improvement in MA that could amount to 200bps of margin.

Overall, we would not be surprised to see some moderation of the consensus post the guidance delivery expected in mid-January. While there are plenty of potential positives, we would expect Elevance to set a (more) prudent set of expectations to start the year. Ultimately, the company will be looking to prove its confidence in a LT EPS algorithm that delivers 12%+ EPS growth over time, and a lower 2026 starting point isn't the worst thing.

Our price target of $377 is based on 13.0x our 2026 EPS of $29.00.

## Actions

With the results of the quarter we are maintaining our estimates for this year but again reducing our estimates for 2026, though increasing our price target. Specifically, our 2025 EPS estimate remains $30.00, implying a decline of -9.0% from 2024. Next, our 2026 EPS estimate moves to $29.00 per share down from the previous estimate of $30.50 (and from the $37.75 per share we were projecting just three months ago), with our new estimate representing a decline of -3.3% from our 2025 EPS estimate (though growth of 7%+ growth off the runrate $27 per share level). Finally, our price target moves to $377 per share, which is based on 13.0x our 2026 EPS estimate which we now view as more conservative.

## Observations

1) Elevance reported a 3Q25 MLR of 91.26%, which was 10bps above our estimate of 91.16% but well below the consensus estimate of 91.7%. Management also suggested that the quarterly MLR was in-line with internal expectations.

At the segment level, much of the commentary mirrored intra-quarter disclosures around cost trends. Starting with Medicaid, Elevance noted that performance has been weaker than expected due to the continuation of elevated cost trends that have not been fully offset by rate updates. Management suggested that cost trend remained pressured due to high levels of utilization and member acuity, with the latter reflecting continued disenrollments among lower acuity members (driven by more stringent eligibility revies and changes to state reverification processes). With that, Elevance now expects that its Medicaid margins will degrade throughout the course of 2025, with the full-year running at -0.5% (i.e. well below the long-term margin target of 2%-4%). Remember, on the 2Q25 earnings call the company had spoken to the expectation for margin improvement in 2H25, with full-year margins expected to remain positive in 2025.

Turning to the individual ACA book, management suggested that performance in 3Q25 developed somewhat favorably relative to the conservative assumptions established in 2Q25. That said, underlying cost trend was described as remaining significantly above historical levels, including elevated trend in inpatient medical surgery, behavioral health, pharmacy, and ER. The company also continues to project an uptick in costs in 4Q25 as members utilize their benefits ahead of coverage terminations in 2026. With that, Elevance is guiding to a high-single digit percentage decline in ACA exchange margins in 2025, which appears unchanged from the company's view in 2Q25.

Performance in the commercial group was described as being consistent with internal expectations for 3Q25, though cost trend remains elevated. Though management disclosed some pockets of pressure related to outpatient utilization and the unit cost mix of services (e.g. high-cost surgeries), overall performance in the book was described as being very consistent with the company's prior outlook.

Finally, performance in the MA segment (including Part D) was described as being marginally better than expected in 3Q25, driven by plan design and member composition (e.g. strong retention). Management suggested that cost trends remain elevated through 3Q25, but have been manageable. Elevance now expects that its MA margin will increase slightly on a year-over-year basis in 2025, reflecting the impact of strong retention, disciplined cost management, and better recognition of member acuity following the elevated utilization seen

in recent years. Even excluding the non-recurring favorable VBC settlement recorded in 2Q25 (sized at $209 million), MA margins are still expected to remain stable or even improve slightly in 2025. This is clearly better than the company's prior outlook for flat MA margins in 2025, though the segment is still expected to operate below the long-term target range of 3%-5% in 2025.

2) With the results of the quarter, Elevance reiterated 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of "approximately" $30.00 per share, as well as its full-year MLR outlook of “approximately" 90.0%. For perspective, Elevance's reiterated EPS guidance came in directly in-line with our estimate of $30.00 for 2025, as well as 0.3% higher than the consensus of $29.90.

Looking ahead, Elevance also provided some directional commentary around expected performance trends for its business segments in 2026. Starting with Medicaid, the company now expects the segment operating margin to decline by "at least" 125bps y/y in 2026, driven by the continued misalignment between rate increases and acuity/utilization trends. Though management anticipates that rate updates will be "modestly above" historical levels in 2026, they are still expected to remain insufficient with respect to elevated utilization trend and ongoing acuity shifts (including the impact of reverifications and program changes). In terms of magnitude, management suggested that utilization/acuity will be relatively equal contributors to the expected -125bps of margin compression in 2026. This contrasts with the company's experience in 2025, where acuity shifts drove closer to just 1/3rd of overall cost trend in the Medicaid segment. On the membership front, management suggested that they expect to see continued enrollment churn in 2026, though the company has begun to see some stabilization in the pace of disenrollments. With that, average Medicaid enrollment in 2026 is expected to be modestly lower than 2025.

In Medicare, the company has taken proactive steps to improve profitability in 2026, including pricing, plan design (e.g. more emphasis around HMOs), and market exits. With that, management reiterated that the company will exit certain plans and service areas where long-term economics are not sustainable - impacting 150K members. Based on our discussion with management, the company expects to make significant progress towards its margin target of 3%-5% in 2026, which compares to slightly above breakeven in 2025.

Elevance also suggested that it is taking a "disciplined position" across its commercial group and individual ACA books for 2026. Remember, the company has previously noted expectations for flat commercial group margins in 2026, while the individual ACA book sees improvement back into the long-term target margin range due to pricing, care management initiatives, and selective provider contract actions. In terms of commercial ASO, the company noted that it expects to see continued expansion in 2026 due to new client growth and high retention

among large employer customers. Elevance also cited strong commercial group risk retention despite maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing for 2026.

In terms of Carelon, Elevance cited a strong selling season for 2026, with several national account wins and high retention. Overall, the company expects to see strong growth across both Carelon Pharmacy and Health Services, reflecting the expansion of external client relationships and further scaling of pharmacy, behavioral health, specialty care management, and home based services. That said, management suggested that this growth will be at least partially offset by the impact of lower membership in the Health Benefits segment.

Across all of the company's segments, Elevance also disclosed that it will deploy "several hundred million" in incremental investments in 2026. Management sized the impacts of this spending at $1.00 per share in EPS, spread across three buckets: 1) AI and Digital Strategy (i.e. Carelon and Health Benefits); 2) Carelon Expansion (i.e. risk capabilities in Carelon Services); and 3) MA STAR Ratings (i.e. investments in CarelonRx to improve contribution to STARS).

Below, we synthesize all the segment-level commentary into potential EPS headwinds/ tailwinds for 2026. The headline is that we see a relatively balanced set of headwinds/ tailwinds that could ultimately limit EPS progress in 2026 relative to the reported total in 2025.

Starting with 2025 EPS guidance of $30.00 per share, we back out $3 per share in favorable non-recurring items (e.g. VBC settlement, tax benefits, valuation adjustments) that benefitted earnings this year. We also take out $1.00 per share to reflect incremental investment spending expected across Carelon and the Health Benefits businesses in 2026. Off this $24.00 baseline, we analyze the balance of headwinds/tailwinds at the individual business line in 2025. Clearly, the largest headwind is Medicaid, where management expects margins to decline from roughly -0.5% in 2025 to at best -1.75% in 2026 (meaning at least a 125bps headwind for next year). Assuming that rate updates slightly offset the expected decline in enrollment, we estimate that the margin decline in Medicaid would represent a headwind of about $2.60 per share in 2026. The company is also planning to exit its PDP business in 2026, which we conservatively estimate at a relatively minimal $0.05 per share headwind to full-year EPS.

Against this series of headwinds are tailwinds related to anticipated margin improvement in Medicare Advantage and the ACA exchanges. In MA, we estimate that ~200bps of margin expansion would equate to a tailwind of nearly $3.30 per share. This would imply an estimated

MA margin of about 2.5% in 2026, still below the company's long-term target of 3%-5%. Next, we estimate that improving the ACA exchange book back to a mid-single digit margin would represent a tailwind of $2.10 per share.

Outside of this margin improvement, we also expect to see tailwinds from growth in commercial group and the Federal Employees program. If we were to assume that commercial group margins remain flat y/y in 2026 (coupled with revenue growth of ~4% y/y), we estimate a tailwind of about $0.90 per share. Assuming flat margins in Federal Employees and more muted topline growth of ~2% y/y, accretion would approach $0.15 per share. With respect to Carelon, we take a conservative stance and assume that "core" margins (excluding investment spending) are flat, while external customer growth is offset by losses related to lower membership in the Health Benefits business. In that event, we still estimate a tailwind of about $0.20 per share just based on the lower projected share count in 2026.

Beyond 2026, management expects to see a return to a more balanced earnings growth profile in 2027. Management clarified that this commentary reflects the expectation that drivers of growth will become more evenly distributed as in the company's past experience, including improved Medicaid rate alignment, further MA margin normalization, and sustained momentum across Carelon. With respect to Medicaid, the company clearly noted that 2026 was expected to be the trough in terms of margin, with sequential improvement expected in 2027 even despite the pending impact of the OBBB implementation. Management identified 4 key drivers of this margin improvement, including: 1) Tightened medical cost management (i.e. expanding behavioral health interventions, specialty drug management, site of care optimization); 2) Rates are expected to begin to catch up to trend and acuity, especially as 2025/2026 experience is reflected in state updates; 3) The 2026 outlook was characterized as being intentionally prudent, providing a credible base of which to improve in 2027; and 4) The OBB phase-in was described as manageable, allowing for a steadier pacing of the risk pool transition (which impacts only about ~20% of Elevance's membership).

3) In terms of seasonality, full-year guidance now implies adjusted EPS of roughly $3.12 in 4Q25, down significantly from $6.03 in 3Q25. Remember, the company had previously stated that 3Q25 would only represent slightly more earnings than in 4Q25. This is clearly no longer

the case, as 3Q25 purportedly included a benefit of $1.00 related to the timing of planned tax actions and stronger net investment income. Adjusting for those items, the earnings distribution between 3Q25/4Q25 would have been more consistent with prior commentary.

On a percentage basis, 2H25 is expected to represent ~31% of full-year earnings, which would be significantly lower than the company's historical experience. For perspective, 2H has representing closer to ~43% of full-year earnings dating back to 2012. This change is being driven by a number of factors, including changes in Part D seasonality (driven by the IRA) and member mix (i.e. lower enrollment in Medicaid, higher ACA exchange). In addition, the company is contemplating a pull-forward of utilization across its ACA exchange population in 4Q25 in response to the pending expiration of enhanced subsidies in 2026. Medicaid margins are also now expected to compress in 2H25 (relative to 1H25), as elevated cost trend has not been fully offset by rate updates.

4) Elevance ended the quarter with approximately ~31.97 million commercial enrollees, down -145K (-0.5%) sequentially and -265K (-0.8%) y/y. The sequential decrease in commercial enrollment was driven entirely by the commercial fee business, which saw membership decline -152K (-0.6%) q/q. In contrast, Elevance's commercial risk-based business has actually grown by 7K (0.1%) q/q. The sequential decline in commercial fee enrollment was driven entirely by the Blue Card segment, which saw membership decrease -176K (-2.7%) q/q.

5) Below, we provide a recap of business unit performance in 3Q25. Starting with Carelon, the segment generated $18.32 billion in revenues during 3Q25 (up 32.9% y/y), but $775 million in operating profit (down -3.5% y/y). According to the company, revenue growth at Carelon was driven by recent acquisitions in Carelon Services (CareBridge) and CarelonRx (specialty Rx), growth in CarelonRx product revenue, and further scaling of risk-based capabilities within Carelon Services. Growth in operating earnings was attributed to improved performance at Carelon Services, as well as higher CarelonRx product revenues.

At the subsegment level, Carelon Services achieved strong revenue growth of 57.9% y/y (operating gain up 19.0% y/y), while CarelonRx saw topline growth of 20.3% y/y (operating gain down -10.2% y/y). The company attributed the year-over-year revenue growth at Carelon Services to the acquisition of CareBridge, as well as robust organic growth (e.g. continued expansion of risk-based and home-health capabilities). Remember, initial full-year 2025 guidance called for Carelon Services revenue growth of "greater than 50%" y/y in 2025, or well above ~20% y/y on an organic basis (i.e. excluding CareBridge). As a reminder, Elevance has been working to scale CareBridge across both dual eligible and high acuity Medicare populations post the closing of the acquisition in December 2024. Specific to risk-based solutions, Carelon Services has expanded its full-risk oncology offering beyond the commercial segment (which was launched last year) and into the Medicare population starting in 2025. Additionally, there has been continued expansion in behavioral health capabilities for the Medicaid business, including offerings for the SMI population. Externally, management has characterized 2025 as the strongest year of third-party growth for Carelon Services, including new contracts with several BCBS plans for solutions in post-acute, behavioral health, specialty care, and palliative services. Turning to CarelonRx, topline growth in the segment was attributed to strong momentum among larger clients and the impact of recent acquisitions (e.g. Kroger).

Turning to margin, Carelon generated an operating margin of 4.2% in 3Q25 (down -160bps y/y), reflecting margin compression at both CarelonRx (down -171bps y/y) and Carelon Services (down -98bps y/y). According to management, the margin compression at CarelonRx has been impacted by planned integration initiatives, as well as investments in technology and operational efficiency. These factors are now expected to result in full-year margins below the initial guidance range for CarelonRx. Remember, the company's initial outlook suggested that CarelonRx's margins be flat to up 20bps y/y in 2025. Through 3Q25 YTD, CarelonRx's margin has been 5.3%, down -97bps y/y. Turning to Carelon Services, the business produced a margin of 5.3% in 3Q25, which was down -98bps y/y due to continued

scaling of the platform's risk-based and home-health capabilities, as well as the dilutive impact of the CareBridge acquisition. Through 3Q25 YTD, Carelon Services has recorded a margin of 5.2%, up 4bps. With that, management suggested that the segment margin was trending towards the high-end of initial guidance for margin compression of 50bps-100bps y/y in 2025, reflecting underlying strength in its VBC model.

Finally, we note that Elevance remains focused on selling into its health plan customer base, with revenue eliminations (a proxy for business between Carelon and Elevance's risk-based membership) up 43.4% y/y in 3Q25. As we have previously stated, the continued growth of Carelon is significant as these services are not restricted by risk-based capital requirements or profitability rules (i.e. minimum MLR, risk corridors, etc.).

Moving to the health benefits segment, revenues increased to $42.25 billion (up 10.4% y/y), driven by higher premium yields, recently closed acquisitions (e.g. Centers Plan), and growth in MA enrollment (more than offsetting lower Medicaid membership). In contrast, segment operating profit was actually down -62.5% y/y to $601 million, due primarily to higher medical cost trend and increased investment spending in workforce/technology, partially offset by higher revenue. With that, the health benefits segment recorded an operating margin of 1.4% in 3Q25, down -277bps y/y. On a YTD basis, the segment has recorded a margin of 3.5% through 3Q25, down -186bps y/y. As a reminder, Elevance's initial 2025 guidance had called for full-year margin compression of 25bps-50bps y/y in 2025, driven by stronger Medicare growth (including Part D impacts) and the absence of non-recurring benefits recorded in 2024. Excluding those two items, the health benefits segment margin for 2025 was initially expected to be flat y/y.

Relative to initial guidance, Elevance now expects that MA margins will increase slightly in 2025 due to strong retention, product positioning, disciplined cost management, and better recognition of member acuity following the elevated utilization seen in recent years. This is clearly better than the initial outlook for flat MA margins in 2025, though the segment is still expected to operate below the long-term target range of 3%-5% in 2025. In Medicaid, management now expects margins to be degrade through the course of the year, with the full-year running at -0.5%. Remember, on the 2Q25 earnings call the company had spoken to the expectation for margin improvement in 2H25, with full-year margins expected to remain positive in 2025. In the individual exchange book, the company continues to expect that segment margins will decrease in the high-single digit percentage range on a year-over-year basis in 2025, which is unchanged from the stance in 2Q25. With underlying trends in the commercial group segment running in-line with prior expectations, we would assume that Elevance continues to expect slight margin compression across its total commercial book (including individual) in 2025.

6) CarelonRx revenue increased 20.3% y/y to $11.0bn and is up 22% year-to-date on adjusted scripts growth of 6% y/y in 3Q25 and 7% YTD. CarelonRx growth continues to benefit from the acquisition of Kroger SP (Oct '24), Paragon (Mar '24, infusion center & SP) and BioPlus SP (Feb '23). We estimate the combined in-house spec pharmacy operations are annualizing at $5-$6bn with only a modest contribution from $10-$15bn in Elevance Health specialty spend shift from the legacy CVS Caremark contract to the BioPlus platform. As Elevance completes the onboarding Kroger SP and integrates the expanded specialty platform with Carelon Health and Elevance Health, the pace of specialty migration is likely to expand in 2026 and 2027.

*   Near-Term Revenue Growth: CarelonRx appears to be on path to outperform initial 2025 revenue guidance for mid-teens growth.
*   Long-Term Revenue Growth: Looking past acquisition contributions, management expects CarelonRx long term revenue growth in the low-double digit range, driven by script volume and drug mix as well as the insourcing of specialty fulfillment from CVS.

CarelonRx adjusted op profit declined -10.2% y/y to $556mn, as integration synergies were more than offset by a step up in investments in PBM and Specialty integration. These investments appear likely to continue into 2026 as initial commentary on 2026 called for several hundred million of incremental investment at an enterprise level with a return to more balanced earnings growth expected in 2027. At CarelonRx, adj op margin declined -171bps y/y to 5.1% in 3Q25 and is running 5.3% YTD, down from 6.3% in the same period of 2024.

*   Near-Term Margin Outlook: Margins are expected to run below prior CarelonRx guidance for Obps-20bps of improvement in 2025 on 6.0% in 2024.
*   Long-Term Margin Outlook: Looking past 2026, management expects CarelonRx margins to normalize at 6.0%-6.5%.

7) Elevance has been one of the industry leaders in MA growth for 2025, with enrollment tracking up 204K (10.0%) YTD through September 2025. This is clearly faster than the overall rate of growth for the industry, which is up an estimated 2.9% YTD through September 2025. After running above full-year guidance of 2.20-2.25 million for most of 2025, Elevance's MA

enrollment of 2.47 million as of September 2025 now appears to finally be within the range (albeit near the high-end). Remember, Elevance's MA enrollment has been declining post AEP given a Medicaid footprint change on March 1st (impacting a large cohort of D-SNP membership), as well as the impact of marketing adjustments.

Looking more closely at the growth profile, Elevance noted that 2025 growth has benefited from strong levels of member retention due to benefit stability, while also being concentrated across HMO products. We see both of these factors as a positive, given the favorable margin profile of returning members and the greater cost control of HMO products relative to PPO. Given strong retention, product positioning, disciplined cost management, and better documentation of member acuity, Elevance now expects that its MA margins will increase slightly in 2025. This is clearly better than the initial outlook for flat MA margins in 2025, though the segment is still expected to operate below the long-term target range of 3%-5% in 2025.

8) Elevance's specialty enrollment was up 0.4% q/q, with increases across both vision enrollment (up 0.7% q/q) and dental (up 0.2% q/q). This coincided with a slight decrease in overall commercial membership (down -0.5% q/q), driven entirely by commercial ASO (down -0.6% q/q) partially offset by commercial risk (up 0.1% q/q). On an annual basis, Elevance has experienced a 4.6% y/y increase in specialty offerings, with vision and dental up 4.4% and 4.7% y/y respectively.

In the following chart, we compare a sample of Elevance's specialty service membership (Life & Disability, Dental and Vision as those are disclosed by the company) to the traditional medical insurance areas (commercial risk and commercial ASO). Specialty or ancillary products and services offered by employers range from dental, vision to specific chronic disease management programs, pre-natal programs etc. Cross-selling specialty services not only provides incremental revenues (at higher margins), it also improves customer retention rates and reduces medical costs (particularly with pharmacy and disease management programs). Though Elevance's specialty segments have historically grown at a faster rate than commercial insurance, this has reversed in recent years due to the loss of a large dental ASO client in 2020 and the sale of the company's life & disability assets in 2024. From 2014 to 2024, Elevance's total commercial enrollment grew at an average annual rate of 0.9%, whereas its specialty enrollment decreased at a rate of -0.1%.

While it's hard to compare ASO fees across companies on an apples-to-apples basis, it appears that Elevance's per member per month ASO fees have tended to be slightly lower than those collected by its peers (though this discrepancy has narrowed significantly in recent years). Part of this is because Elevance has historically not focused on specialty insurance, whereas its competitors — as evidenced by their higher PMPMs — directionally provide a higher number of specialty and ancillary services. In 2019, the company began to see a reversal in this trend, with higher specialty penetration driving growth in administrative fees and profitability. In 2019, we estimate that Elevance's average ASO PMPM grew to $36.10, representing impressive growth of ~86% y/y (the fastest pace in over 12 years).

Moving into 2020, Elevance expected additional upsell opportunities from the transition to IngenioRx to increase the profitability ratio between the risk and fee-based businesses to 4:1 (compared to 5:1 previously). However, a slowdown in the commercial selling season (reflecting the impact of COVID-19) impeded progress towards that profitability goal. As such, we estimate that Elevance's average ASO PMPM fees fell from $36.10 in 2019 to $31.90 in 2020. According to management, Elevance made significant progress towards its ASO profitability goals throughout 2021, with the company achieving a risk/fee-based profitability ratio of 4:1 by year-end. Since 2018, Elevance has grown the enterprise-wide earnings generated from fee-based members by over 60%, with that number expected to increase by at least another 50% over the next five years. This growth is expected to be driven by deeper penetration of specialty products and services from Carelon.

With that said, we continue to believe that there is room for additional penetration of specialty products within Elevance's commercial business. In the following chart we compare Elevance's specialty product penetration rates to Cigna's and broader industry averages (where data is available). Clearly, Elevance is tracking below average in the areas it discloses. Put another way, Elevance has additional room for growth.

In the table below, we estimate the incremental revenue and earnings opportunity from cross-selling additional specialty services (this doesn't account for ancillary benefits such as improved client retention rates or lower medical costs). At a 20% margin, an increase in ASO PMPM's of between $1-$5 would represent 1%-4% upside relative to 2025E adjusted EPS.
