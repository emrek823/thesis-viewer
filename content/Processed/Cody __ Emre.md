### Benchmarking and Evaluation Datasets

- Protege builds LLM-based evaluation datasets for medical diagnostics
	- Supply medical records with evaluation criteria (clinical accuracy, patient triage quality)
	- Human judges assess model responses to create training data for companies
	- Currently exploring LLMs as judges functionality
- Emre interested in potential intro to Ross (evaluation space expert)
	- Ross has strong technical knowledge but unclear on business reality vs. sales pitch
	- Scaling challenges common across evaluation/benchmarking investment space

### Standard Model Bio Partnership Discussion

- Kevin Katz (CEO) connection through Shaub introduction
- Real contract traction with pharmaceutical companies
	- Predicts probability of technical/regulatory success (PTRS)
	- Develops biomarkers for clinical trials and trial design
	- CDS platforms for cardiotoxicity prediction (working with MD Anderson)
- Comprehensive multimodal foundation model architecture
	- API deliverable to biopharma for patient data access
	- Key pillars: omics, EHR data, imaging data
	- Recent preprints on next event prediction models from EHRs
	- DNA foundation models using novel tokenization mechanisms

### Healthcare AI Investment Landscape

- Provider-facing prior authorization tools increasingly complex market
- Smart DX acquisition case study (acquired by New Mountain)
	- 18 months manual chart coding at NY Presbyterian (pre-ChatGPT)
	- Built confident sensitivity/specificity to sit on top of 3M platform
	- Second-pass workflow positioning enabled premium pricing
- Current reality: Founding engineer reports annotation/labeling now faster to build in-house than procurement

### Technical Talent and Market Dynamics

- Justin Rapp update discussed - bounced back from previous hiccup
- High competition for founding engineers across healthcare startups
- Tool use capabilities reducing need for specialized annotation services

### Next Steps

- Emre to potentially facilitate Standard Model Bio intro for imaging data needs
- Regular NYC meetups planned (Tuesdays/Thursdays) - casual 10-20 person gatherings
