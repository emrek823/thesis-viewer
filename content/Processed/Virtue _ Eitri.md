### Team Updates & Hiring Progress

- Zach started Monday this week - settling into 3-4 days in-person, 1-2 days remote
- Sam starts December 1st (Monday after Thanksgiving)
- Strong positive vibe between both hires
	- Sam: traditional engineering experience, bio domain knowledge
	- Zach: exceptional data science and ML expertise
- No additional hiring planned near-term

### Big Picture Platform Vision

- One-stop shop for every manufacturing decision between biopharma companies and CDMOs
- Data platform/infrastructure for all past batch records and manufacturing results
- Operating system for CDMO operations:
	- Project proposals (speed, cost, site selection, process changes)
	- Tech transfer and process gap analysis
	- Batch-to-batch manufacturing optimization
	- Final batch disposition packet generation

### Current Product Development Focus

- Primary focus: document processing data extraction platform
	- Massive text-based and handwritten manufacturing documents from CDMOs
	- Foundation enables easier wedge use cases (batch comparison, vendor selection)
	- Zach architecting and owning this core infrastructure
- Application layer guided by customer discovery with new Skylarks and CDMO partners

### 2026 Planning & Go-to-Market Strategy

- Multi-persona prospecting and discovery approach:
	- CDMOs
	- Small/mid-sized biotech
	- Large cap pharma
- Target larger multi-program companies in Phase 2/3 (not IND-enabling stage)
- Product roadmap confidence: 60-70% for 90 days, 30% for 12 months
- Three main wedge opportunities:
	- Batch disposition use case (most excited about)
		- Batch record review for compliance
		- Lab quality control testing analysis
	- RFP project qualification (primarily CDMO use case)
	- Process optimization (competitive landscape concern)

### Competitive Landscape Concerns

- Process optimization space crowded: Catalyze AI, Arc Biotech, Datahow
- Contradiction: VCs excited vs process scientists saying “solved in 90s with existing equations”
- Need to determine if it’s real product-market fit or VC zeitgeist

### Next Steps

- Quinn: Prepare December call for forward-looking 2026 planning discussion
- Connect with Justin for tactical go-to-market advice (zero-to-one sales perspective)
- Full rotation into building sales process - applying same rigor used for talent acquisition
