## Premier, Inc. (PINC)

### PINC to be Taken Private by Patient Square for $2.6bn, $28.25 Per Share

After a prolonged period considering strategic alternatives, Premier announced Monday the company will be acquired by healthcare focused private equity firm Patient Square Capital for $2.6bn. Under the terms of the deal, shareholders will receive $28.25 in cash per share, representing a 24% premium to Premier's 60-day volume-weighted average price prior to initial reporting of a potential deal on September 5th. The price represents a 10% premium to the unaffected closing price of $25.75 on Friday. The deal values Premier at approximately $2.6 billion EV, or 11x the consensus EBITDA for fiscal year 2026.

Premier's Board has approved the deal which is expected to close in 1Q 2026. The transaction is expected to close by 1Q CY26 with the dividend suspended in the meantime. While not unanticipated as the company has been seeking strategic alternatives for some time now, today's announced transaction marks the end of Premier's 12-year run as a publicly traded company, following its IPO in 2013.

Patient Square may find synergy with recent investments. The Premier transaction represents the second significant take private of a supply chain and technology asset by Patient Square in 12-months following the Dec 2024 acquisition of Patterson Companies. It is also possible Patient Square will find synergies with CorroHealth, a revenue cycle solution firm that selling into health systems and plans.

We reiterate our Hold rating while raising our target price to the offer price of $28.25, from the prior price of $27.00.

Buy - Current stock price generally represents upside to our 12-month price target of 20%+. Sell - Current stock price generally represents downside to our 12-month price target of 20%+. Hold - Current stock generally represents limited opportunities on both the long and short side over 12-month period.
