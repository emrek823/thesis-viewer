### Background & Context

- Bain Capital looking to spin out their insurance technology assets
- Company started as A&H distribution platform
- Acquired Jet Health (EDE platform) 24 months ago to avoid paying HealthSherpa $10M annually
- Previous issues: couldn’t get timely data access (90-day lag with third-party EDEs)

### Current Business Components

#### Jet (EDE Platform)

- Generates couple million in revenue currently
- 15 tech people tied to EDE platform
- Core capability: enrollment for ACA and related products
- Currently serves portfolio company and third-party clients
- CMS approval process takes ~3 years for new EDEs

#### ICHRA Business

- Started 18 months ago building ICHRA capabilities
- Integrated with:
	- CardSpan
	- Lynx (card swipe solution for employer funds)
- Partnership with Venteur (PEO) for distribution
- Exclusive distribution agreement for ICHRA business
- Revenue streams: admin fees, carrier commissions, swipe fees

### Leadership Needs

- No dedicated CEO (seeking ICHRA expertise like Centene executive)
- Missing head of sales (targeting Rippling/Deel type profile for small business sales)
- Current leadership:
	- Former Emre Life president (field sales background)
	- Individual market sales expertise

### Investment Opportunity

- Seeking $10M-$15M raise
	- $5-10M gives sufficient OpEx runway
	- Not burning cash urgently
	- Likely only capital raise needed
- Bain willing to co-invest
- Venteur potentially interested in investing (current or future round)
- Zero credit if sold with portfolio company
- Planning standalone spin-out

### Strategic Advantages

- Real opportunity in space due to:
	- Off-X/On-X parity regulations
	- Take Command seeking EDE solutions
	- High barriers to entry (3-year CMS approval process)
- Exclusive relationship with Venteur
- Broker-friendly model:
	- Maintains broker compensation
	- Manages customer service
	- Provides free CAC and carrier best commissions

### Next Steps & Growth Strategy

- Focus on building out sales team
- Product and strategic partnerships in place
- Potential UI/UX improvements needed
- Expand to additional PEOs
- Improve employee group onboarding process
