# Executive Summary

## 1. Opportunity to make preferred equity investment in Cotiviti, a leading provider of payment integrity solutions for healthcare payors, generating savings from identification and correction of erroneous and overstated claims

- Leading business serving 400+ customers nationally, including all top 25 payors in the US
- #1 market share leader for payment policy management, coding validation and clinical chart validation
- Fully independent provider; differentiator vs. largest competitor Optum, which is less favored by some customers given Optum’s ownership by the largest payor (United Health)

## 2. Secondary acquisition of existing preferred equity interests issued in 2018 with high visibility on refinancing

- Existing preferred was poised for redemption along with acquisition of company by Carlyle Group. Acquisition did not materialize as Carlyle could not raise equity financing
- Carlyle was able to raise sufficient debt and preferred equity capital for the transaction (with meaningful oversubscription). Total net debt and preferred committed was $6.4bn vs. current total leverage through preferred of $5.8bn

# Cotiviti Value Add Across Claims Processing Life Cycle

| Claim Filing            | 2 Pre-Pay "Prospective"                                       | Post-Pay Retrospective |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Provider files claim    | Payors run adjudication process                              | Post-payment review     |
| After treating a patient, healthcare provider submits a claim with procedure and diagnosis codes | Additional pre-payment review (secondary editing / clinical review) |  |
|                        | 100% of claims are funneled through primary editing         | ~10-30% of claims are flagged for secondary editing / additional reviews, mainly for claims with: |
|                        | Primary editing is generally first adjudication process      | High claim value or complex treatments |
|                        | Payors auto-adjudicate ~70-90% of claims                    | Claims from hospitals   |
|                        | (auto-adjudicated claims are usually paid without further review) | Lack of trust in certain providers |
|                        | Short time frame limits activities as payors need to pay claims within 30-45 days |  |
|                        | Clearinghouses standardize batches of claims, performing rudimentary checks (e.g. provider numbers) before sending claims to payor |  |

## Claim payment    Payment reimbursement

- [1] Clinical review: detailed audit of medical record;
- [2] FWA: Fraud waste and abuse analysis / investigation;
- [3] COB: Coordination of benefits between multiple payors covering one individual;

| **Key Points**                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strong revenue visibility given long-term contracts and high renewal rates, with ~99% historical retention              |
| • Secured ~$3bn of TCV through renewals since 2020, and ~70% of current revenue from top 10 customers is not up for renewal until 2025 onward, providing significant confidence in the near-term outlook |
| • Cotiviti's near-term forecast is underpinned by agreed-upon new sales implementations and optimizations (adoption of an existing edit by an existing customer), which generally take ~2 years to fully ramp. Annualized values for implementations and optimizations are typically agreed upon between Cotiviti and its customers. The Company currently estimates that at the end of 2022, annualized existing contracts, implementations, and optimizations represent over $300mm of run-rate revenue |
| 67% gross and 53% PF RR adj. EBITDA margins as a result of the Company's highly automated solution set as well as its largely fixed operating cost base (~40% of COGS and ~80% of SG&#x26;A are either fixed or semi-fixed) |
| • Market growth in the payment integrity market is driven primarily by stable, relatively acyclical, growth dynamics      |
| • Healthcare insurance enrollment (~1-2% growth p.a.) and per member healthcare spending (CMS projects ~5% growth p.a.) collectively contribute ~6-7% p.a. to overall market growth |
| Stable Business with Limited Downside                                                                                  |
| • These drivers potentially provide a stable baseline growth outlook through economic cycles as enrollment and spending growth are anchored by demographic trends and medical cost inflation |
| • In 2020, during one of the most adverse healthcare volume environments in history, Cotiviti witnessed only a 5% decline in YoY revenue, and rebounded strongly in 2021, growing revenue 13% YoY |
| • Experienced management team with extensive experience and strong demonstrated track record of organic growth and executing on acquisitions and integrations |
| Best-in-class Management Team                                                                                          |
| • CEO and Chairman Emad Rizk has 35+ years of experience in the industry and has run Cotiviti and predecessor companies since the initial carve-out from Verisk Analytics |
| • Cotiviti's executive management team has deep experience in payor-focused services, with an average tenure of 25+ years in the industry |

**Note:** $300mm+ of run-rate revenue is excluded from $812mm of 2022E PF Run-Rate Adj. EBITDA

# High ROI Value Proposition Drives Sticky Relationships (1/2)

Cotiviti's contingency revenue model drives high-ROI for payors and significantly impacts payors' profitability.

## Illustrative Payor Economics (PPM)

Claims volume represents dollars of claims submitted by healthcare providers to payors that are reviewed by Cotiviti. Payors are required to spend >85% of health care premiums on medical claims and use Cotiviti's offering as a critical tool to maintain Medical Loss Ratios (MLRs). Cotiviti reviews a payor's claims against a library of edits that are used to identify claims that have been overbilled or contain an error, resulting in savings for the payor when the claim is replaced with correct code and paid. Portion of the payor's savings that Cotiviti receives as payment for the successful savings it identifies based on a contracted contingency fee.

### Contingency Rate Fees

| Year | Savings Rate | Net Payor Savings |

| **Leverage incumbency with existing customers to drive additional penetration via new edits and products** |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Estimated ~$3-4bn in near-term payment integrity whitespace in existing clients, which can be captured through cross-selling of existing products, new product introductions, and the expansion of edits at existing clients ("optimizations") |
| • Launched in late 2019, the optimization program drove $139mm, $169mm, and $150mm of ACV in '20, '21, and '22, respectively |
| Cotiviti generates optimizations by leveraging claims data across the customer base, identifying novel patterns of fraud, waste, and abuse, and creating new edits to address these savings opportunities. The Company then works collaboratively with clients to introduce these edits across existing implementations, which results in a high margin revenue stream in a relatively short ramp time |
| • Cotiviti also has a significant opportunity to continue cross-selling newly developed products into existing customers |
| Cotiviti's core focus has been on the largest national health plans; Blues and regional health plans represent the next leg of growth |
| Currently, ~36% of covered lives in U.S. accounted for by payors with less than 10mm but greater than 100k members |
| • This "mid-market" represents an incremental $550mm+ penetration opportunity. The Company secured over $65mm in mid-market payment integrity ACV from 2019 - 2021 |
| Cotiviti's solutions offer a more salient value proposition to customers in the mid-market because those customers cannot commit the necessary R&#x26;D budget to in-house payment integrity solutions |
| Mid-market customers are more likely to source their technology needs from a single partner or vendor, making them an attractive opportunity for Cotiviti |

| **Drive post-pay volumes into pre-pay by investing in automation for CCV, COB, and Data Mining** |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| • A significant driver of historical margin expansion and share gain at Cotiviti has been the development of pre-pay edits across multiple business lines |
| • Pre-pay (vs. post-pay) solutions identify solutions earlier and result in less provider abrasion, a significant consideration for health plans particularly in a post-COVID environment |
| Cotiviti's significant data assets on retrospective payment integrity can help drive automation in prospective, further differentiating payment integrity capabilities |
| Cotiviti's CV technology, for example, is unique and differentiated from competitors as it enables efficient pending of claims for quick clinical review in a pre-pay environment |
| Cotiviti has developed a full pre and post-pay product suite, which will continue to accrue to its benefit as payors increasingly require an end-to-end approach in favor of point solutions |

| **Invest in R&#x26;D to deliver new products and capabilities** | - The Company has successfully invested in R&#x26;D historically to deliver new products and capabilities, with 15 new products representing $160mm+ in ACV launched since 2019.
- Velocity of new solutions is accelerating, with the Company growing from 3 new solutions in 2019 to a total of 12 new solutions across 2020-2022.
- Expanding market opportunity, with an additional $1.8bn in total SAM added from new products in 2019-2022.
- Cotiviti has 8 solutions currently in development, representing a roughly $300mm+ revenue opportunity. |
| **Capitalize on existing market position to expand into VBC adjacencies** | - Regulatory action and the financial impact of COVID on payors and providers will continue to drive expansion of risk-sharing models.
- Cotiviti's longstanding payor relationships and position within payment workflows offers insight into key pain points of emerging value-based care arrangements.
- The Company is well-positioned to leverage its expertise in claims and risk-adjustment data to offer payors analytics tools and workflow software for plan design, administration, and payment.
- Assets acquired in HMS transaction add capabilities around care management and member engagement that can help payors identify care gaps and improve care outcomes/efficiency. |
| **Build scale and enter new markets through additional M&#x26;A** | - Cotiviti has an experienced team and established playbook for integrating and optimizing acquisitions (e.g., Cotiviti, HMS, GDIT Health) that make continued M&#x26;A an attractive go-forward strategy.
- Actionable opportunity to expand/optimize Cotiviti's existing risk adjustment solution in a fragmented market.
- Company is also well positioned to accelerate its Value-Based Care strategy to better address major payor pain points through acquiring existing point solution vendors that offer rapid market entry opportunities.
- The payment integrity market offers attractive opportunities for M&#x26;A, as well as the member engagement and population health management markets, where the Company could augment its existing capabilities from a data and functionality perspective with a complementary acquisition. |
