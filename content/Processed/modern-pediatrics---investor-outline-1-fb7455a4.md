# The Punchline

*   Healthcare system sucks... suboptimal solution for both patient and provider
*   By reframing pediatric primary care as a consumer product (and, importantly, as a two-sided market with two distinct sets of customers - each with specific, addressable needs + an opportunity/need to connect them), MP aims to create a new paradigm in pediatric care...
*   This reorientation was driven by unique insight into our customers' pain points + desires (and deep understanding of US healthcare system)... and is what allows MP to create a 10x experience for patients + providers...
*   As MP creates meaningful value for both sides of the market, several virtuous cycles are created which enable scalable growth, long-term defensibility, and increasing operating leverage (and significant FCF) over time... this is possible as a function of two things 1) MP's products + systems being designed intentionally with each of these goals as first-order objectives and 2) the inherently advantageous characteristics of our customer + service
*   MP understands what successfully realizing our vision (#1 PCP in 200+ MSAs within 10 years) is dependent upon... to date, our customers have validated MP's core product offering / biz model... and now we have a plan for the next phase in realizing our vision. Let us convince you!

1.  How we got here: Why primary care (and pediatrics in particular) is broken for both providers and patients...
    a. Caused by a number of (mostly) structural issues
        i. Fee-for-service health insurance structure
            1. Payment for primary care is lumped in with payment for catastrophic events, despite primary care being ill-suited for an insurance structure
            2. Consumers of services aren't the ones who pay for those services + service providers can only provide certain reimbursable services and can't set their own prices = very little shopping by consumers & very little innovating by providers
            3. Employer-sponsored health insurance as an entrenched tax-deductible benefit perpetuates the problem
        ii. MD-centric culture
            1. Wrong provider for majority of primary care services, especially in pediatrics (mostly uncomplicated patients)
            2. MDs are too expensive to be profitable, but compensation is still too low given high student loan balances = no man's land
            3. Culture resistant to empowering other provider types better suited for the job (e.g., nurse practitioners)
        iii. Patchwork of legacy IT systems & manual processes
            1. Software engineering has never been a core competency of provider orgs
            2. 2009 HITECH Act locked providers into rigid one-size-fits-all legacy electronic health record systems
            3. No ability to automate processes, requiring high staffing ratios, high staff turnover, and a resource drain
    b. The consequences of this structure
        i. Providers...
            1. Are overworked / burnt out / unfulfilled
            2. Struggle to build lasting relationships with patients
            3. Are stuck with soul-crushing administrative burdens
        ii. Patients...
            1. Are left with short appointments and rushed care
            2. Are stuck with soul-crushing administrative burdens
            3. Can't find affordable alternatives to traditional private practices & health systems
        iii. Provider orgs...
            1. Grow slowly
            2. Aren't very profitable
            3. Are largely undifferentiated
            4. Struggle to innovate and improve on the status quo
2.  We're fixing it by reframing pediatric primary care as a consumer product
    a. Two-sided market with two distinct sets of customers
        i. Each with specific, addressable needs
        ii. Opportunity/need to connect them
    b. This reorientation creates a virtuous cycle enabling
        i. Non-linear growth
        ii. Long-term defensibility
        iii. Increasing operating leverage (and significant FCF) over time
    c. Ultimately results in a 10x experience for providers + patients
3.  Here's how we do it...
    a. Starts with three key elements
        i. Use membership fees to break out of the FFS insurance stranglehold
        ii. Empower NPs to be primary care providers instead of MDs
        iii. Build our own technology and heavily automate manual processes
    b. These elements enable us to
        i. Offer high-demand services that payers won't cover (or won't pay enough for)
            1. In-home well & sick care visits
            2. In-home lactation consulting
            3. 24/7 virtual care
            4. ...more to come
        ii. Attract the top tier of NPs from the traditional system (and pay them well!)
        iii. Improve unit economics & growth
        iv. Attract capital not available to traditional provider orgs
    c. The benefits of this structure
        i. Customer #1 - Providers (NPs in particular)
            1. Are empowered to serve as PCPs and focus on building lasting relationships (the reason they got into medicine in the first place)
            2. See dramatically fewer patients per day (7-10 visits/day vs 20-30 visits/day) without sacrificing compensation
            3. Get home at a reasonable time every day to spend time with their family (they often have young children)
            4. Are relieved of the soul-crushing administrative burdens of a traditional practice
        ii. Customer #2 - Patients
            1. Get access to additional services they love
            2. Are able to spend as much time as they need with their provider, building a lasting relationship
            3. Are relieved of the soul-crushing administrative burdens of dealing with a traditional practice
4.  Here's why the economics are so interesting...
    a. Unit economics are 2x better than traditional practices
        i. Traditional practice (per location)
            1. Providers & clinical staff
                a. 5 MDs ($180k salary)
                b. 1 NP ($95k salary)
                c. 9-10 clinical support staff ($34-60k salary equiv.)
            2. Facilities & supplies: 25-30% of revenue
            3. Membership revenue: 0% of total revenue
            4. Gross margins: Low 20% range
        ii. MP economics (per pod)
            1. Providers & clinical staff
                a. 1 MD ($200k salary)
                b. 6 NPs ($112,500 salary)
                c. 1-2 clinical support staff ($20-50k salary equiv.)
            2. Facilities & supplies: 5-10% of revenue
            3. Membership revenue: 25-30% of total revenue
            4. Gross margins: 40-50% range
    b. Acquisition economics are phenomenal
        i. High satisfaction with care model creates virtuous cycle for both providers & patients
            1. Providers...
                a. Recruit the best providers they've worked with at other practices
                b. Improve each other through a culture of collaboration
                c. Keep recruiting time/costs low through frequent referrals
            2. Patients...
                a. Enthusiastically tell their friends & family about MP, making it the largest source of new customers
                b. Write amazing public reviews, driving high volume of organic traffic & new customers
                c. Voluntary churn at very low rates - moving is the only meaningful churn reason
        ii. Resulting acquisition economics
            1. Blended CAC = ~$150/patient
                a. ~5 month CAC recovery (GP dollars)
            2. LTV = ~$2,000 (GP dollars)
                a. ~14x LTV/CAC
    c. Increasing operating leverage will drive significant FCF
        i. Primary care is rife with manual administrative work - a centralized back-office enables us to
            1. Automate much of the work with our own technology (only 50% automated today)
            2. Outsource remaining work to low-cost geographies
        ii. Route density an important driver at the individual market level
            1. Algorithmic well-child visit scheduling creates increasingly dense core routes
            2. Geo-aware self scheduling enforces efficiency constraints while giving patients more options
        iii. Huge operating leverage upside with patient education
            1. One-to-many leverage with newborn prep classes
            2. Resource center / video content significantly decreases provider burden
            3. Social media leverage is key with new parent demographic
        iv. Meaningful health insurance reimbursement rate negotiation leverage with scale
            1. Differentiated services are an important factor for payers
            2. Patient enthusiasm for MP will add leverage
5.  Here's how we're going to build a category defining business...
    a. Our vision is ambitious but achievable
        i. #1 PCP in 200+ MSAs in 10 years
        ii. Offering a full suite of pediatric services that belong in primary care

    b. Prepare for rapid scaling with Seed funding
        i. Relatively low time and capital requirements
            1. 24 months
            2. $5 million
        ii. Transform our Austin “prototype” into a growth machine (in parallel with new market launches)
