placement securities other than in a registered offering or pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial
burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales,
and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own
risk.

10. The Purchaser knows that the Purchaser may have tax liability due to the uncertain
value of the shares. The Purchaser understands that the Board believes its valuation of the shares
represents a fair appraisal of their worth, but that it remains possible that, with the benefit of hindsight,
the Internal Revenue Service may successfully assert that the value of the shares on the date of the
Purchaser's purchase is substantially greater than the Board's appraisal. The Purchaser understands that
any additional value ascribed to the shares by such an IRS determination will constitute ordinary income
to the Purchaser as of the purchase date, and that any additional taxes and interest due as a result will be
the Purchaser's sole responsibility payable only by the Purchaser, and that the Company need not and will
not reimburse the Purchaser for that tax liability. Residence. The address of my principal residence is set
forth on the signature page below.

11. Address. The address of the Purchaser's principal residence or principal place of business
is set forth on the signature page below.

12. No “bad actor" disqualification events. Neither I nor any person that would be deemed a
beneficial owner of the shares (in accordance with Rule 506(d) of the Securities Act) is subject to any of
the "bad actor” disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) through (viii) under the Securities Act,
except as set forth in Rule 506(d)(2)(ii) or (iii) or (d)(3) under the Securities Act and disclosed,
reasonably in advance of the purchase or acquisition of the shares, in writing in reasonable detail to the
Company.

By signing below, I acknowledge my agreement with each of the statements contained in this
Investment Representation Statement as of the date first set forth above, and my intent for the Company
to rely on such statements in issuing the shares to me.

Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure created on: 3/31/2004 2:33:01 PM
Parties agreed to: Simon Arkell

# CONSUMER DISCLOSURE

From time to time, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati (we, us or Company) may be required by
law to provide to you certain written notices or disclosures. Described below are the terms and
conditions for providing to you such notices and disclosures electronically through your
DocuSign, Inc. (DocuSign) Express user account. Please read the information below carefully
and thoroughly, and if you can access this information electronically to your satisfaction and
agree to these terms and conditions, please confirm your agreement by clicking the 'I agree'
button at the bottom of this document.

## Getting paper copies

At any time, you may request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available
electronically to you by us. For such copies, as long as you are an authorized user of the
DocuSign system you will have the ability to download and print any documents we send to you
through your DocuSign user account for a limited period of time (usually 30 days) after such
documents are first sent to you. After such time, if you wish for us to send you paper copies of
any such documents from our office to you, you will be charged a $0.13 per-page fee. You may
request delivery of such paper copies from us by following the procedure described below.

## Withdrawing your consent

If you decide to receive notices and disclosures from us electronically, you may at any time
change your mind and tell us that thereafter you want to receive required notices and disclosures
only in paper format. How you must inform us of your decision to receive future notices and
disclosure in paper format and withdraw your consent to receive notices and disclosures
electronically is described below.

## Consequences of changing your mind

If you elect to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format, it will slow the
speed at which we can complete certain steps in transactions with you and delivering services to
you because we will need first to send the required notices and disclosures to you in paper format,
and then wait until we receive back from you your acknowledgment of your receipt of such
paper notices or disclosures. To indicate to us that you are changing your mind, you must
withdraw your consent using the DocuSign “Withdraw Consent" form on the signing page of
your DocuSign account. This will indicate to us that you have withdrawn your consent to receive
required notices and disclosures electronically from us and you will no longer be able to use your
DocuSign Express user account to receive required notices and consents electronically from us
or to sign electronically documents from us.

## All notices and disclosures will be sent to you electronically

Unless you tell us otherwise in accordance with the procedures described herein, we will provide
electronically to you through your DocuSign user account all required notices, disclosures,
authorizations, acknowledgements, and other documents that are required to be provided or
made available to you during the course of our relationship with you. To reduce the chance of
you inadvertently not receiving any notice or disclosure, we prefer to provide all of the required
notices and disclosures to you by the same method and to the same address that you have given
us. Thus, you can receive all the disclosures and notices electronically or in paper format through
the paper mail delivery system. If you do not agree with this process, please let us know as
described below. Please also see the paragraph immediately above that describes the
consequences of your electing not to receive delivery of the notices and disclosures
electronically from us.

---

## How to contact Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati:

You may contact us to let us know of your changes as to how we may contact you electronically,
to request paper copies of certain information from us, and to withdraw your prior consent to
receive notices and disclosures electronically as follows:

## To advise Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati of your new e-mail address

electronically to you, you must send an email message to us at csherman@wsgr.com and in the
body of such request you must state: your previous e-mail address, your new e-mail address. We
do not require any other information from you to change your email address.
In addition, you must notify DocuSign, Inc to arrange for your new email address to be reflected
in your DocuSign account by following the process for changing e-mail in DocuSign.

## To request paper copies from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati

To request delivery from us of paper copies of the notices and disclosures previously provided
by us to you electronically, you must send us an e-mail to csherman@wsgr.com and in the body
of such request you must state your e-mail address, full name, US Postal address, and telephone
number. We will bill you for any fees at that time, if any.

## To withdraw your consent with Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati

To inform us that you no longer want to receive future notices and disclosures in electronic
format you may:
i. decline to sign a document from within your DocuSign account, and on the subsequent
page, select the check-box indicating you wish to withdraw your consent, or you may;
ii. send us an e-mail to csherman@wsgr.com and in the body of such request you must
state your e-mail, full name, IS Postal Address, telephone number, and account number.
We do not need any other information from you to withdraw consent. The consequences
of your withdrawing consent for online documents will be that transactions may take a
longer time to process.
