Fast-tracking AI, devices and diagnostics to improve patient care

Providing enterprise solutions to equip your leadership, physicians and care teams with resources to advance your programs while being recognized as a leader.

The Hub blends clinical validation, hands-on startup support and a joint $10 million venture fund for digital health, devices, diagnostics, care models and augmented intelligence (AI)—also known as artificial intelligence.

“Our work with Michigan State grew from the recognition that we could create something bigger together than either of us could do alone,” said Lisa Prasad, vice president and chief innovation officer at Henry Ford Health.

Henry Ford Health is part of the AMA Health System Member Program, which provides enterprise solutions to equip leadership, physicians, and care teams with resources to help drive the future of medicine.

Building an end-to-end pipeline

“What Henry Ford brings to the table is our clinical expertise, access to a large diverse patient population, and the operational environment to test new ideas and validate new solutions,” Prasad said. “We are a living, breathing test lab for new innovations.”

From AI implementation to EHR adoption and usability, the AMA is fighting to make technology work for physicians, ensuring that it is an asset to doctors.

From vision to validation

The Hub backs early-stage innovations that improve care and generate returns—marrying clinical validation with commercial discipline.

“This is not a grant program. It’s a professionally managed venture fund designed to generate returns,” Prasad noted. “So, for the $10 million investment, we will be looking at the returns on that investment in addition to the measurable improvements in patient care and outcomes.”

“Our doctors who are actually leading the clinical trial are excited about it,” Prasad said.

Additionally, Protera Health, a musculoskeletal care company spun out of Henry Ford, is scaling nationally. MSURF invested early, reinforcing the Hub’s commitment to nurturing local innovations.

Money, mentorship and market access speed ideas into real-world impact, Prasad explained.

“That combination of money and mentorship and market access, that's what speeds ideas into real world impact,” she added. “The better we are at doing this, the more rapidly we can validate and launch that technology or idea into use.”

Measuring success, shaping the future

Success for the Hub will be measured both commercially and clinically. Metrics include number of pilots launched, speed of moving from idea to scale, jobs created, capital attracted and — most importantly — improvements in patient outcomes.

Prasad noted that a program will be deemed successful if it hits the metric that matters most: better patient health.

“Improved access, earlier diagnosis, fewer complications, stronger patient satisfaction,” Prasad said. “We want these solutions to serve our patients at the end of the day.”

Looking ahead, she sees growing potential in AI and digital health tools for diagnostics, decision support, and virtual care. Cancer and neuroscience are also expected to drive biotech and precision medicine innovations. Meanwhile, accessible care delivery such as hospital-at-home could help address workforce shortages and cost pressures.

“It’s not just about supporting startups. It’s really about building an integrated health care innovation economy in Michigan,” Prasad said.
