### 1 Ingest Claims Data
A minimum of 12 months of Claims Data is loaded into the MavRx system. The data is reviewed and normalized instantly, preparing it for analysis.

### 2 Historical "Reprice"
A historical reprice is conducted to determine "net" historical cost after program and rebate savings. A historical reprice is then provided for each option.

### 3 Predicted "Goprice"
The claims data is adjusted to reflect changes in utilization, price inflation, and churn - "trend". Trend is applied and a "Net Cost After Trend" value is created.

### 4 Expected Cost Calculation
The Net Cost After Trend value serves as Expected Cost value. This value is unique to each of the PBM's evaluated for a Plan Sponsors Rx Only Stop Loss coverage.

### 5 Aggregate Corridor Calculation
Adjustable aggregate corridors available with a benefit up of up to $10m. Corridor is derived from the Net Cost After Trend value, not from Gross Cost.

### 6 Stop Loss Premium
Stop Loss premium is calculated using a variety of different factors including group size and credibility, as well as PBM validation level (PCI Score 0-100).

## Slide 6: PMPM Guarantee Introduction

# PMPM Guarantee Introduction

### Exclusions
*   Covers all drugs, with few exceptions
*   Highest value to Plan Sponsor
*   Can be used by Plan Sponsor as a true budget

### Alignment
A PMPM Guarantee aligns the interests of the PBM and Plan Sponsor by incentivizing the PBM to effectively manage the program by penalizing them if they do not.

### Accountability
A PMPM Guarantee is the simplest and most effective way to hold a PBM accountable for their management of the plan.

### Certainty
Budget certainty is provided to the Plan Sponsor by capping the plan's financial exposure.

### Evaluate
A PMPM Guarantee is the simplest way to evaluate PBM's in a repricing or RFP exercise by reducing the impact of all other variables.

### PMPM Guarantee Definition
A contractual agreement between a PBM and Plan Sponsor that sets a fixed amount, represented as a PMPM, as a performance benchmark.

### Underperformance
PBM provides the Plan Sponsor with financial protection if the costs exceed the benchmark. Assuming the difference between the guarantee and actual performance. (eg $120)
*WriteWise will digitally perform the audit & reconciliation

**Conceptual Bar Chart: PMPM Guarantee Levels**
*   $115 (below benchmark)

### 4 Invite PBM's to Bid
Following the initial reprice & goprice analysis, you will work with your client to determine which PBM's you would like to invite to submit a PMPM Guarantee Bid.

### 5 Create the Auction
All within the MavRx platform, you can set the terms and duration of the auction, digitally invite PBM's to submit, and communicate with them directly.

### 6 Collect PBM Bids
When the auction period ends you will have collected PBM PMPM Guarantee Bids. These bids all follow the same PMPM Guarantee terms, conditions, and guarantees.

| Group 3 | $1,199.38 | $41.50 | $22.52 | $1,263.40 |

*(Note: The exact sum from the table on Slide 18 for 'Max Claims', 'Spec Prem', and 'Agg Prem' blend values might not exactly match the bars' tops if there's minor rounding, but the values for Spec Prem and Agg Prem for each group are displayed directly on the bars in the chart. The Agg Attachment Point here is the Max Claims 'Blend' value from the previous slide.)*

Based on chart labels:
*   **Group 1:** Agg Attachment Point: $1100 (approx), Spec Premium: $42, Agg Premium: $20. Total = $1162
*   **Group 2:** Agg Attachment Point: $1137 (approx), Spec Premium: $42, Agg Premium: $21. Total = $1200
*   **Group 3:** Agg Attachment Point: $1196 (approx), Spec Premium: $42, Agg Premium: $23. Total = $1261

*(Using the more precise numbers from the prior table and summing for comparison purposes with the chart visuals: Group 1: $1098.13 + $41.50 + $20.49 = $1160.12. Group 2: $1141.10 + $41.50 + $21.35 = $1203.95. Group 3: $1199.38 + $41.50 + $22.52 = $1263.40. The chart simplifies these values to whole numbers and approximate attachment points for visual clarity.)*

## Slide 20: PMPM Guarantee Expected Claims Impact (PEPM)

# PMPM Guarantee Expected Claims Impact (PEPM)

### What is a PMPM Guarantee?
*   Retrospective trend cap on PBM-based Rx (e.g. $80 PMPM; $128 PEPM)
*   If final net spend exceeds $80 PMPM (after discounts, rebates, etc) PBM reimburses plan sponsor
*   Plan Sponsor pays claims in real time, reconciliation occurs post-plan-year
*   Includes all drugs covered by the PBM contract
*   Excludes drugs run through the Medical (e.g. infusions)
*   Creates "Expected Rx" certainty

**Chart: Stacked Bar Chart - PMPM Guarantee Expected Claims Impact (PEPM)**

*   **Legend:** Expected Claims Cap, Exp Claims Reduction
*   Horizontal line at $128 PEPM represents the PMPM Guarantee level.

| Group | Expected Claims Cap (PEPM) | Exp Claims Reduction (PEPM) | Total Expected Claims (PEPM) |
| :---------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| PMPM Guarantee | $128 | $0 | $128 |
| Group 1 | $128 | $48 | $176 |
| Group 2 | $128 | $92 | $220 |
| Group 3 | $128 | $141 | $269 |

*(Note: The total expected claims for Groups 1, 2, and 3 are calculated as Expected Claims Cap + Exp Claims Reduction, and these totals align with the 'Rx Exp' values from the 'No PMPM Guarantee' table on Slide 21 if $128 PEPM is converted to PMPM. The 'Exp Claims Reduction' represents the difference between the original Rx trend and the capped guarantee.)*

*(Note: "Claim Factors" on the chart corresponds to the "Agg Factors" total minus the premium components from previous tables, and visually represents the bulk of the cost. The values displayed on the bars ($1,165, $1,074, etc.) are the "Max Cost" values from Slide 22. The internal breakdown of Spec Premium and Agg Premium on the chart for the "With PMPM G" bars seems to reflect the lower Rx component from Slide 21's 'With PMPM Guarantee' table, specifically the 'Rx' row under 'Corridor' for Agg Premium and a consistent Spec Premium for all groups.)*

Approximate breakdown based on visual representation:

**Group 1:**
*   Without PMPM G: Total $1,165 (Claim Factors approx $1100, Agg Prem approx $20, Spec Prem approx $45)
*   With PMPM G: Total $1,074 (Claim Factors approx $1030, Agg Prem approx $10, Spec Prem approx $45). Savings: $91

**Group 2:**
*   Without PMPM G: Total $1,209 (Claim Factors approx $1140, Agg Prem approx $25, Spec Prem approx $45)
*   With PMPM G: Total $1,063 (Claim Factors approx $1000, Agg Prem approx $10, Spec Prem approx $45). Savings: $146

**Group 3:**
*   Without PMPM G: Total $1,269 (Claim Factors approx $1200, Agg Prem approx $25, Spec Prem approx $45)
*   With PMPM G: Total $1,059 (Claim Factors approx $990, Agg Prem approx $10, Spec Prem approx $45). Savings: $210

## Slide 24: Key Takeaways

# Key Takeaways

MGU's who adjust their pricing models can offer more competitive stop loss quotes, decreasing Max Cost proposals by 5%-25%.

### PMPM Guarantees Shift how Rx Risk is Underwritten:
Financial responsibility shift from MGU to PBM allows MGUs to de-rate catastrophic Spec & Agg risk assumptions:
*   Rx cost certainty and PBM assumption of catastrophic risk allows MGUs to lower the Rx component of Spec Premium.

Cap on Rx spend decreases Rx claims factors:
*   Reduced Rx claims factors lead to a reduction in Agg Premium.
*   Allows MGUs to reduce the Rx corridor, allowing plan sponsor to significantly lower funding requirements.
