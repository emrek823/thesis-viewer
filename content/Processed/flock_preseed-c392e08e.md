Enriching the lives of people
with serious mental illness

## Slide 2: Executive Summary

Problem
*   14M+ patients suffering from Serious Mental Illness (SMI) →
*   -$75B in excess costs for crisis care (ED, inpatient)

Solution
A digital care platform that helps patients detect and mitigate crises to improve patient wellbeing and reduce payer costs:
*   Detect crises via active (patient- and community-reported) and passive (biomarker, e.g. sleep, GPS, heart rate) data
*   Mitigate crises via targeted interventions (medical and psychosocial) and navigation (e.g. voluntary admission)

Status
Flock Health is founded by and in residence at the Endurance Venture Lab in SF. We are finalizing the Founding Team and expect to raise $5M in 2023. We're seeking feedback on our clinical model, payer relations, and go-to-market.

## Slide 3: Problem

Patients with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) are prone to recurrent and cyclical mental health crises with dire consequences.

The status quo of care is reactive, acting after crises have become acute, instead of proactive, when interventions can have outsized preventative impact.

This is expensive for the system and difficult for patients, with all roads leading to Emergency Departments for triage and care.

| Patients           | Friends & Family             | Providers                    | Payers                           |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| -Job loss          | -Strained relationships      | -ER Overutilization          | -High excess spend on care       |
| -Homelessness      | -Financial challenges        | -Staff safety concerns       | -High incidence of comorbidities |
| -Violence          | -Unpredictability & fear     | -Negative margins on treatment | -Few available preventative solutions |
| -Suicide           |                              |                              |                                  |

## Slide 4: Solution

A digital product that prevents ED visits by detecting crises early and mitigating them through targeted interventions.

1.  **Flock's platform identifies decompensation by analyzing:**
    *   → Qualitative patient data (symptom tracking, medication adherence)
    *   → Qualitative community-reported data (collateral observations)
    *   → Quantitative biometric data (e.g. GPS/geofencing, sleep, heart rate fitness, and exercise tracking)
2.  **When an upcoming crisis is detected, patients meet with a Flock clinician for tailored medical and psycho-social interventions to mitigate crises and avoid ED & in-patient stays**
    *   → Representative medical interventions for Schizophrenia and Bipolar: rapid-acting antipsychotics, e.g. Risperidone, Olanzapine.
    *   → Representative psychosocial interventions for depressive episodes: coping mechanisms, stress management, and interventional therapy.
3.  **For crises requiring emergency attention, Flock collaborates with providers to streamline care and help patients navigate the process**

## Slide 5: Revenue

We will sell to payers through a PMPM subscription model.

## Slide 6: Market

Preventing and mitigating these crises provides a large cost-savings opportunity for payers, resulting in a TAM of ~$10.5B based on a simple shared savings model.

**Top Down**
*   ~$75B (Excess annual ED and inpatient costs)
*   X 35% (Estimated ED & inpatient stays prevented)
*   X 40% (Estimated average shared savings rate)
*   = ~$10.5B (Initial opportunity)

A bottoms-up estimate based on fee-for-service pricing on just remote patient monitoring indicates a TAM of ~$19B.

**Bottoms Up**
*   ~14.2M (Americans suffering from SMI)
*   X $1,345 (Estimated annual per-patient remote patient monitoring revenue¹)
*   = ~$19B (Estimated SMI RPM opportunity)

¹ Estimated based on Medicare rates, excluding additional revenue for interventions/visits

## Slide 7: Go-To-Market

We will partner with major providers who will refer patients at discharge from intensive psychiatric treatment*.

We'll initially target younger, commercially insured patients who have an engaged support community.

For many patients, this is often the point where they recognize the severity of their illness and feel the greatest need for support and prevention.

**Representative Target Partners**
*   ZUCKERBERG SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL Hospital and Trauma Center
*   VA U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
*   SAN JOSE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
*   KAISER PERMANENTE
*   Stanford MEDICINE

**Status Quo Patient Journey**
*   Regular State
*   ↓
*   Decompensation
*   ↓
*   Acute Crisis
*   ↓
*   Intensive Treatment
*   ↓
*   Discharge

**Flock Patient Journey**
*   Monitoring & Prevention
*   ↓
*   Decompensation
*   ↓
*   Targeted Intervention
*   ↓
*   Crisis Navigation (if necessary)
*   ← Flock Referral (from Discharge)

*E.g. inpatient, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient programs

## Slide 8: Competition

There are no incumbents addressing SMI crisis intervention.

Many opt to focus instead on lower cost, lower acuity, fee for service models.
