High Cost Burden
Autism represents a cost burden over $7 trillion across 2.1 million individuals and $3.5 million lifetime costs.

Autism prevalence has grown by 10% annually for the last 50 years(1)
**Autism Prevalence Historical Data (from line chart, approximate values)**

| Surveillance Year | Prevalence |
|---|---|
| 1970 | 1:10,000 |

## Slide 4: 1 Delays in Care
ANNA
1 Delays in Care
The first driver of significant cost is the structural challenges that have resulted in substantial delays in care, deteriorating outcomes.

**Care Pathway Flow:**
1.  Family meets with pediatrician during child's wellness visit
    *   Pediatricians are not trained to diagnose autism during 15-minute well visit, leading to only 20% of children being diagnosed by age 3(1)
    *   `-> X` (barrier)
2.  Pediatrician makes referral to subspecialist
    *   Developmental pediatrician wait times are 5+ months(2)
    *   `-> X` (barrier)
3.  Subspecialist makes referral to ABA center
    *   ABA center wait times are an additional 5+ months(3)
    *   `-> X` (barrier)
4.  Child intake at ABA center

## Slide 5: 2 Low-Quality Care
ANNA
2 Low-Quality Care
The second driver of cost is the primary model of care for autistic kids, Applied Behavior Analysis ("ABA"), is ineffective.

| Challenges in ABA | Consequences of Traditional ABA |
|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Highly Structured, Rigid Programs   | Skills learned in highly structured, artificial settings do not transfer well to real-life situations                                                                                |
| Focus on Rote Learning              | The repetitive and structured nature of DTT can lead to decreased motivation and engagement, especially if the activities do not align with the child's interests                   |
| Focus on Compliance and Behavior Modification | Emphasis on compliance can overlook the child's autonomy and can be perceived as prioritizing conformity over personal growth                                         |
| Intensity and Duration of Therapy   | Intensive sessions can be developmentally inappropriate, causing stress and reducing the effectiveness of the therapy for young children                                          |
| Minimal Parent Involvement          | Traditional ABA has less emphasis on parent training, limiting the reinforcement of skills outside therapy sessions                                                              |
| Fragmented care                     | Traditional ABA can operate in silos, with little communication between behavioral, speech, and occupational therapies, limiting overall effectiveness.                          |

## Slide 6: 3 Fragmented Care
ANNA
3 Fragmented Care
Thirdly, a major source of cost is the fragmentation of care, leading to gaps in care and poor outcomes.

**Fragmented Care Flowchart:**

*   **Patient** connects to:
    *   **Teacher**
    *   **Pediatrician** connects to:
        *   **Speech Language Pathologist**
        *   **Occupational Therapist**
        *   **Behavioral Health Therapist**
        *   **Developmental Pediatrician** connects to:
            *   **ABA Center**

The Teacher also connects to the Developmental Pediatrician and Behavioral Health Therapist.

**Multi-Specialty Care & NDBI Flow with AI Data Model:**

**Multi-Specialty Care components:**
*   Speech Language Pathology
*   Occupational Therapy
*   Diagnostic Evaluations

**Data Flow:**
*   (1) Speech Language Pathology interventions are collected in `Electronic Health Record`.
*   (1) Occupational Therapy interventions are collected in `Electronic Health Record`.
*   (1) `Electronic Health Record` also connects to `NDBI and Interval-Based Data Collection`.
*   (2) Diagnostic Evaluations feed into `NDBI and Interval-Based Data Collection`.
*   (3) `NDBI and Interval-Based Data Collection` feeds into `AI Data Model`.
*   (4) `AI Data Model` feeds into `Electronic Health Record` (for point-of-care recommendations).

**Commentary:**
1.  Coordinated multi-specialty clinical model interventions are collected in EHR
2.  Diagnostic and 6-month re-diagnostic tracks progress on DSM-5 diagnostic characteristics of autism (social communication)
3.  AI-driven data model trains on comprehensive EHR data combining multi-specialty interventions with diagnostic progression
4.  AI data model utilizes data to inform point-of-care recommendations to improve quality of care delivery

Further Empirical Evidence for NDBI
In a Randomly Controlled Trial (RCT), the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM), a popular NDBI, demonstrated improved outcomes in IQ, adaptive behavior, and diagnostic status with a significant reduction in diagnosis classification and adaptive growth in parallel with typically developing children.

**Commentary:**
*   After 2 years, children provided with the ESDM showed significant improvements in IQ, adaptive behavior, and diagnostic status compared with children who received community interventions.
*   At year 2, the ESDM group improved 17.6 standard score points compared with 7.0 points in the comparison group relative to baseline, demonstrating gains through ESDM are sustainable over time.
*   71% of the children in the group that received community-based intervention retained their diagnosis of autistic disorder over the 2-year period, only 56% of children in the ESDM group did so.
*   The ESDM group not only showed improvements adaptive behavior—communication, social skills, and practical self-care—but maintained their growth rate in adaptive behaviors parallel to a normative sample of typically developing children.
