### Business Performance & Operations

- Strong revenue growth in Q1, with gross margins trending positively
- Diagnostics impacts CAC timing due to billing/evaluation timing mismatch
- Contribution margin trending toward 35-40% (vs PE-backed competitors at 25-30%)
- Reduced burn rate while maintaining growth
- BCBA billing improved with new bonus comp plan resonating well
- Each location becomes profitable at 6-8 clients, ~$300-400k OpEx/CapEx to breakeven
- Mature locations generate $1.5M in unlevered cash flow

### Real Estate & Expansion

- Comfortable opening new locations during ramp-up period
- Key constraint: 6-12 month timeline for new locations due to:
	- Lease term negotiations
	- ADA compliance
	- Zoning approvals
- Upgraded broker to JLL - targeting 25 markets with multiple locations
- Current status:
	- Weston pushed to early Q3 2023
	- Q4 targets: Auburn, Woburn, South markets
	- Wayland expanding by 6,000 sq ft
- On track for 4 locations by EOY including Wayland expansion

### Strategic Planning & Risk Management

Top 3 risks identified looking back:

- Need for more aggressive contracting/credentialing pursuit
- Earlier team deployment - needed on-ground presence sooner
- Hiring challenges - overestimated BCBA availability, need stronger recruiting relationships

New market preparation requires:

- Becky’s ramp-up (joining from Landmark)
- Real estate evaluation framework
- Referral source development
- Focus on contracting/credentialing and real estate timing

### Technology & AI Strategy

Two-pronged approach:

- “Steak” - Current operational AI implementations:
	- Automated intakes
	- Document retrieval
	- Benefits verification
	- Interview processing
	- Session notes automation
	- Scheduling optimization
- “Sizzle” - Market positioning & innovation:
	- Clinical intelligence layer development
	- Intraday progress tracking vs traditional 6-month reauth
	- Research capabilities from longitudinal data
	- Treatment plan dynamic updates
	- Point-of-care recommendations

Diverge AI implementation framework:

- Documented all potential AI use cases
- Prioritization matrix:
	- Painfulness score (error prone, time to output, tedium)
	- Value assessment (revenue, quality improvement, medical expense, corporate cost)

### Financing & Growth

Series A considerations:

- Timing aligned with $5-10M revenue milestone (Q4-Q2)
- Limited recent care delivery Series A deals in past 12 months
- Working capital line opportunity with Avid Bank:
	- Could leverage profitable locations
	- 7.32% interest rate
	- Potential for warrant coverage
	- Consider split banking strategy to mitigate risk

### Quality & Service Development

- Strong qualitative feedback but need empirical measurement
- Launching social groups program:
	- 70% contribution margin
	- Improves BCBA/RBT retention through additional income
- Expanding TAM through center-based services for older population
- Need to develop research validation for social group effectiveness
