For Piotr Surma, the co-founder of Polish healthcare AI startup Ingenix, the pharmaceutical industry has long been awaiting its ‘Chat GPT moment.’

While artificial intelligence, or AI, has been dominating headlines recently—and influencing more than a few aspects of modern life—there has been one field where it has yet to make significant progress: human biology.

That could be about to change.

Ingenix is a new type of AI model, based on a deep understanding of human biology, which its founders describe as a “disruptive, proprietary multimodal and multiscale generative AI co-pilot.”

In simple terms, it’s a specialized AI system, capable of processing and integrating multiple types of data (multimodal) at different levels of detail (multiscale). Like Chat GPT, it will use generative AI techniques, which means it can learn from existing data, information and patterns of activity.

The aim? To provide valuable insights, predictions, and recommendations that will help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug trials when developing new drugs and therapies. That could lead to better drugs for an array of diseases being brought to patients more quickly and efficiently than in the current system.

In the world of big pharma, where companies spend billions every year trialing new drugs, Ingenix could be a game changer.

The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) says AI could generate $60 billion to $110 billion a year in economic value for the pharma and medical-product industries. AI for scientific discovery was also ranked No. 1 in the World Economic Forum’s  Top 10 Emerging Technologies Report last year, which spotlights technologies with the most potential to positively impact the world.

In the world of big pharma, where companies spend billions every year trialing new drugs, Ingenix, which has just secured $9 million in seed funding from investors including IFC, could be a game changer—not least for millions of patients in emerging markets.

The challenges of bringing a new medicine to market are well documented.

The process is lengthy and complex, often taking 10 to 15 years from initial discovery to market approval. Given what’s at stake, the failure rate is high: Surma says the industry invests approximately $50 billion annually in clinical trials, yet nine out of ten pilot drugs still fail to get regulatory approval.

“The number one problem in the pharma industry is the risk associated with clinical trial failure. If the drug fails in the final phase of testing, they might lose billions. That can kill even a mid-sized pharma company,” he says.

Those high costs are frequently passed on to consumers, resulting in higher drug prices and limited access to new medications, particularly for patients in developing countries. They can also deter smaller companies from developing new treatments, leading to fewer medical advances and a focus on more profitable markets, neglecting diseases prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.

These are some of the challenges Surma and his co-founder Adam Dankiewicz are hoping to address with Ingenix. The pair are no strangers to AI. Before Ingenix, they founded Applica, an AI-based startup specializing in proprietary multimodal large language models—advanced AI systems that can process and integrate various types of data. This was successfully sold to Snowflake in 2022.

“When we reflected about our next project, we realized that in biotech, chemical biological data is very much multimodal. You have a lot of different types of data. So far, nobody has been able to effectively integrate all the data modalities into a single powerful model that would comprehend certain elements of human biology,” says Surma.

“We also realized that while there are many companies in AI-powered drug design—a pretty straightforward use for generative AI—there are not many in clinical drug development. So, we decided to build a powerful AI platform to focus on that.”

Ingenix’s premise is simple—to make clinical trials more predictable, even for first-in-class drugs, which deploy new mechanisms of action.

Surma says the company is in the business of “de-risking clinical trials.” To do this, it’s assembling an interdisciplinary team incorporating some of the best minds in the world, from the fields of both AI and biology.

“Because we’re trying to use AI methods to simulate certain elements of human biology, we need teams that combine very intimate understanding of biology with a cutting edge understanding of modern AI and mathematics. So, we are training people who have skills in mathematics and AI in biology and vice versa.”

The company is in the business of de-risking clinical trials. "What we are going to do is to predict the outcome of clinical trials and use human judgment to make decisions."

Ingenix’s model is based on a deep understanding of human biology—from the molecular level, through to cells, tissues and organs and populations. Using data from existing biobanks—Surma believes there is more than enough in them to meet their needs—the model can simulate drug safety and efficacy by predicting clinical outcomes and potential adverse events, ultimately saving time and money.

"Ingenix’s platform integrates state-of-the-art AI models, proprietary closed-source ones, and third-party models including open-source and clients’ models. We are pushing the frontiers of AI with the best people on board and a budget that keeps us agile and innovative.”

He says the aim is not to replace clinical trials but rather, to de-risk the process.

“What we are going to do is to predict the outcome of clinical trials and use human judgment to make decisions. I don't believe the industry will be at such a level of excellence anytime soon that anyone would trust AI without running clinical trials.

“There is so much space for optimization in terms of clinical trials, time and money spent that this is more than enough.”

The power of supporting startups

Although Ingenix’s cutting-edge AI technology had strong potential to transform drug development, the company was still pre-revenue when IFC first engaged, focused on product development and testing its business model, and not yet ready for typical IFC investment.

IFC’s early support to Ingenix was not conventional financing, but leveraging its pre-investment Upstream approach to help validate Ingenix’s product feasibility and test a scalable business model. IFC provided technical assistance to help the company shape its growth strategy and expansion into emerging markets, where faster, lower-cost clinical trials could have outsized impact. IFC is also connecting Ingenix with potential partners to create opportunities for enterprise sales, pilot projects, and field testing. The collaboration reflects IFC’s broader commitment to inclusive and responsible use of AI in healthcare.

To date, IFC has invested over $3 billion in venture capital through more than 175 investments in tech startups and over 120 venture capital (VC) funds across 40 countries. Through its active direct and indirect VC investments via funds, IFC's impact in fiscal year 2024 included supporting over 340,000 jobs.

“Investing in digital health startups like Ingenix can help address the health care gap and ensure more equitable access to medical services,” says Farid Fezoua, IFC’s Global Director for Disruptive Technologies, Services and Funds.

“IFC’s digital health strategy focuses on leveraging digital technologies to improve health care access, quality, and efficiency, especially in emerging markets. A key aspect of our mandate is to help companies like Ingenix develop business plans to bring these technologies to emerging markets early, making them more widely available and impactful.”

Ami Dalal, IFC’s Global Upstream Lead for Disruptive Technologies, says AI is expected to increase clinical trial efficiency and reduce the costs of clinical drug development by up to 25 percent. “That kind of cost reduction can be transformative to pharmaceutical development and healthcare access in emerging markets,” she adds.

IFC made a similar investment in KERA Health Platforms just over a year ago, a pre-seed stage health tech company, based in Senegal, using AI to combine separate data like medical records, lab results, pharmacy info, and health insurance. The technology will make healthcare better in Senegal, a country where regions outside the capital have fewer than seven medical doctors per 100,000 people.

This investment also benefitted from early-stage funding and technical assistance from IFC, which supported KERA in R&D to enhance its Electronic Health Record product, testing market fit, and navigating market and regulatory requirements.

The investments are also part of a wider World Bank Group strategy to boost the impact of digital transformation in developing countries. The WBG’s Accelerating Digitalization Global Challenge Program, for example, was a cornerstone of its second Global Digital Summit recently held in Washington DC.

“IFC is not only supporting local innovation but also helping to generate knowledge and solutions that can have a transformative impact worldwide."

By leveraging WBG financing, private capital, and policy reforms, the program seeks to address digital opportunities and challenges and help low- and middle-income countries adopt cutting-edge solutions for sustainable growth, promoting safe and inclusive digitalization.

It’s a mission that resonates strongly with Surma.

“We believe Ingenix is very much needed and that it will make an impact. We want it to be part of something that is important. We didn't want to earn another 100 million by building a language model that will be just more or less useful,” he says.

“We wanted to do something that would be of value for everybody, and for patients everywhere.”

For Ary Naïm, the World Bank Group Country Manager for Poland, the investment highlights “Poland's growing role as a hub for global innovation and advanced technological capabilities.

“Ingenix is a prime example of how Polish entrepreneurs are leveraging cutting-edge AI and scientific expertise to address complex global challenges, such as improving healthcare access and efficiency,” he says.

“IFC is not only supporting local innovation but also helping to generate knowledge and solutions that can have a transformative impact worldwide, particularly in emerging markets."
