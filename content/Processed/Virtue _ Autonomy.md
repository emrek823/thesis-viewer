### Vendor management updates

- Transitioning from Stedi to FrontRunner for eligibility checks
	- Stedi provides raw JSON responses requiring normalization
	- FrontRunner normalizes payer responses into standardized schema
	- Cost advantage: 11-12¢ per check vs Stedi’s 10-15¢ + 75¢ for coordination of benefits + 75¢ for insurance discovery
	- FrontRunner is 15-year-old company with single owner, poor documentation but solid core product
- Testing multiple AI solutions: Felicity, Cloud Cruise, Cyber Desk
	- Dropped Kaizen after testing
	- Still evaluating effectiveness across vendors

### Hiring and engineering capacity

- Two contract engineers currently, third underperforming (likely to cut in 7-10 days)
- Adding senior engineer from Marcore
	- Will work 10 hours/week + bring Indian contract engineers
	- 50 hours/week each from two Indian engineers
	- 3-6 month engagement, open-ended structure
	- Introduction came from angel investor

### Athena implementations progress

- North Carolina practice (7 physicians): accelerated timeline
	- CEO ready to migrate, physicians hesitant due to age/career stage
	- Demo scheduled Wednesday for physicians and support staff
	- Demo Thursday for leadership team
	- CEO will pitch to physicians after demos complete
	- Aetna price reductions creating $100-200k revenue shortfall - positioning migration as cost savings
- Texas practice: communication breakdown
	- Trading redlines, accepted terms, then went silent post-Thanksgiving
	- 10-14 days no contact, missed 12/1 go-live date
	- Advisors say this is common with physician customers
	- Continuing follow-up attempts

### Business development and expansion

- Positive inbound momentum
	- Florida practice call scheduled tomorrow
	- Virginia practice assessment in progress
	- Both inquiries through website
- Two major selling events in February: Texas conference and Neuronet
- Vertical integration roadmap priorities:
- Data collection strategy for value-based care
	- Daily/monthly patient check-ins via text (migraine, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s)
	- Building datasets for disease progression tracking
	- Long-term vision: “Kaiser for neurology” model

### Strategic considerations

- Michigan practice acquisition risk
	- Large practice (2-2.5x Texas size) under NDA
	- NIRA attempting acquisition for $40-60M
	- Concern about spending 6 months implementing only to lose client post-acquisition
	- Exploring potential counter-offers or buyout structures
- Investor interest management
	- Multiple inbound requests via LinkedIn and network
	- Maintaining focus on execution over fundraising
	- Planning to revisit investor conversations in Q1/Q2
