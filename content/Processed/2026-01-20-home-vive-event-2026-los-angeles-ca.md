WHAT EXACTLY IS VIVE?

### ViVE is the premier event where the business of healthcare meets the future of technology.

Co-created by **HLTH** and **CHIME, ViVE** unites **health systems and payer leaders** with the innovators, investors, and solution partners driving measurable transformation across digital health.

This is where **CIOs, CTOs, CMIOs, and digital health executives** come to accelerate strategy, evaluate technology, and collaborate on what works. In just a few days, ViVE delivers the insights, peer connections, and real-world solutions it would take months to achieve elsewhere.

We’re excited to return to **Los Angeles**, a hub for healthcare innovation. With 9,000+ executives across the ecosystem, ViVE 2026 is where healthcare’s digital leaders meet to decide what’s next.

**Join your peers at the only digital health event focusing on YOU.**
