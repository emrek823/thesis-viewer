MIAMI, Sept. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- OpenEvidence announced today its acquisition of Amaro, an AI-native advertising company founded by Kush Khosla and Sauren Khosla and backed by Google Ventures and Greycroft. Amaro was built to help companies analyze and optimize end-to-end advertising deployment using fast, intelligent automation.

"I've had the privilege of backing both OpenEvidence and Amaro, and it's exciting to see them join forces," said Sangeen Zeb, general partner at GV. "The Khosla brothers have built an exceptional team at Amaro — combining resilience, vision, and technical excellence. This acquisition is a great fit, as Amaro's team and technology will help OpenEvidence accelerate its growth and further expand access to a trusted tool for clinicians."

The partnership expands OpenEvidence's platform capabilities as the company continues to scale for healthcare professionals — particularly in building a modern, sustainable, and user-first advertising infrastructure informed by Amaro's team, product, and technology.

"OpenEvidence powers over half a million clinical conversations per day to verified American clinicians–for free. We believe every patient deserves to be seen by physicians with access to the highest quality information in the world, and our free-to-physician, ad-supported model enables every single practice in the country to leverage this technology, no matter the level of resources available to them," said Zachary Ziegler, cofounder of OpenEvidence. "The Amaro team moves fast, ships relentlessly, and shares our obsession with quality. This acquisition gives us a huge boost as we scale, and Amaro is a natural fit that accelerates our vision."

The acquisition reflects OpenEvidence's continued momentum in building the nation's dominant medical search and AI platform for clinicians, and follows its recent $210 million Series B financing, which valued the company at $3.5 billion. OpenEvidence is used by more than 40% of physicians in the United States who log in daily to make high-stakes clinical decisions at the point of care, and is currently adding 90,000 clinicians per month to the platform.
