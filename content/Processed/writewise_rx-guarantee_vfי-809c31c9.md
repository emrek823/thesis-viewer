## Slide 1: WriteWise Rx Guarantee Program

# Rx Guarantee Program

## Slide 2: Specialty Drug Value
# Specialty Drug Value

### SEVERITY
Specialty drugs are prescribed for chronic conditions that are continuous and require high adherence.

### LONGEVITY
More specialty drugs are being both developed and approved than brand or generic drugs due to the symptom reduction they provide.

### COSTS
Specialty drugs mitigate medical cost by 50%

SPECIALTY DRUGS OFFER LIFE ALTERING VALUE TO PATIENTS
WriteWise

## Slide 3: Specialty Drug Cost
# Specialty Drug Cost

### 75x
The cost of specialty drugs are 75X higher than brand and generic medications

### 50%
Specialty drugs make up 2% of total claims but 50% of pharmacy spend

### +30%
Specialty drugs also have an additional 30% ADDED cost due to drug manufacturer rebates that are never redeemed by the employer

### ↑
The cost of drugs to the employer is rising faster than the decrease in medical costs those drugs are supposed to provide which is eating into the employer's total liability

SOLUTION NEEDED TO PROVIDE THESE LIFE ALTERING DRUGS WITHOUT BANKRUPTING THE MEDICAL PLAN
WriteWise

## Slide 4: Price Pharmacy Separately
# Price Pharmacy Separately

### PHARMACY FOCUS
Pharmacy claims are adjudicated through a separate system from medical claims allowing cost containment and diversion programs that are pharmacy focused only.

### REBATES
Rebates are managed through the same admin platform where they are aggregated and returned to the premium holder.

### 10-20% SAVINGS
This provides anywhere from 10-20% savings in total medical cost if pharmacy is carved out from the medical plan.

### PROFIT VS. MEDICAL RISK
But today, the FI carrier uses that 10-20% profit for margin purposes and not the medical risk.
WriteWise

## Slide 5: Competitive Differentiation
# Competitive Differentiation

### PHARMACY IS NOT PRICED SEPARATELY
From medical in market as FI sells products together for greater administrative return

### FULLY INSURED CARRIERS RETAIN REBATES
and coupons – largest part of administrative margin

### COMPETITORS WOULD HAVE TO ELIMINATE THIS BENEFICIAL FRAUD
– they get meaningful margin by retaining rebates in particular from specialty drugs

### THIS ALSO LIMITS THEIR INCENTIVE
to reduce inappropriate specialty drug utilization

THEY MAKE MONEY DOING THE WRONG THING!
WriteWise

## Slide 6: Competitive Differentiation
# Competitive Differentiation

### PHARMACY CLAIMS COST DOES NOT HAVE A SEPARATE MANUAL
– the experience is tied to the medical manual and assigned proportionally (70/30 medical/pharmacy against total cost).

### Generic and brand drugs are colinear to medical spend but SPECIALTY DRUGS ARE THE INVERSE IN COST TO MEDICAL COST due to the chronic nature of the diseases they mitigate.

### The inverse cost is not proportional – THE DRUG COSTS 20X THE REDUCTION IN MEDICAL COST.

### If specialty drug claims volume is greater than 2% of total claims and/or greater than 50% of the cost of all drugs THE LOSS RATIO FOR THE MEDICAL PLAN WILL BE >100%.

YOU NEED EXPERIENCE ISOLATED TO PHARMACY, AN ESTIMATION OF FUTURE TREND INDEPENDENT OF MEDICAL RISK, AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF DRUG COST NET OF REBATES TO UNDERWRITE A PHARMACY CARVE OUT.
WriteWise

## Slide 7: Pharmacy Only Stop Loss
# Pharmacy Only Stop Loss

### CARVE OUT PHARMACY FROM MEDICAL PLAN
with separate premium pricing (net premium costs lower)

### WILL WRITE ANY BUSINESS
(PEO, GOV ENTITIES.....)

### CAN BE BUNDLED WITH BOTH SUPPLEMENTAL AND INDEMNITY COVERAGE
for disease specific drug costs (autoimmune, rare disease, etc.)

### LEVEL FUNDED COVERAGE
– returns surplus to the group or offers protection on cost escalation long term

### COVER ALL DRUGS EXCEPT INPATIENT J CODES
(which fall under medical plan)

### FOCUSED ON >100 GROUPS
to minimize single drug specialty risk

## Slide 18: What makes us UNIQUE
# What makes us UNIQUE

### FIRST PEOPLE to separate medical and pharmacy in A&H underwriting

### WE UNDERSTAND that the risk medical 70% and pharmacy 30% is not correct for every group – IT DEPENDS ON COMPLIANCE AND ADHERENCE

### We use Verikai to CORRECT TREND incorporating medical risk and compliance/adherence behavior

### We know unit cost from PBM partner which creates both an UNDERSTANDING OF AGGREGATE RISK AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF EXPERIENCE

### We want the REAL BENEFIT OF CUSTOMERS by reducing the price of goods to a minimum profit for us (change the market)
WriteWise

## Slide 19: The Future
# The Future
IN THE FUTURE WE SEE THE MARKET TURN INTO MORE OF A LEVEL FUNDED MARKET

### We would like to create a product
"500 OF THE MOST USED GENERIC DRUGS"
based on a (pmpm) $7-$10 that do not provide full coverage.

### We want to make our level funded pharmacy product a
GUARANTEED COST PRODUCT
that will help us retain the book/customers.

### We learned from our experience that to win business we need to be
10%-15% UNDER THE COMPETITORS

### Our pharmacy product will be written at
110%-125% AGGREGATE
