# Introduction
Thatch is a modern health benefits platform for startups. Our mission is to help startups give great healthcare to their teams. We make this experience possible by applying modern fintech infrastructure created by companies like Stripe, Unit, and Plaid to the legacy healthcare payments rails (HSA, FSA, HRA).

Paying for healthcare sucks. It's painful for individuals navigating a complex system, and it's also painful for founders who buy healthcare for their teams. Healthcare is the second biggest line item on most P&Ls after salaries, and the typical startup founder spends countless hours managing insurance and benefits. Although startups spend so much time and money on healthcare, the employee experience is still terrible. This is insane.

Using Thatch, founders give great healthcare to their team in a few minutes. Founders self-serve onboard by connecting payroll and bank accounts, setting a budget, and inviting their team to sign up. Team members use that budget through the Thatch card to personalize their ideal healthcare experience: paying for the health insurance plan they choose, buying discounted digital health products and services, and covering out-of-pocket expenses. Thatch is like Ramp for healthcare.

# Why Now?
The experience of paying for healthcare is terrible, and getting worse. 9 in 10 US consumers now use digital fintech apps and services to manage their finances, and a third of patients said they wished healthcare payments were more like the financial services industry. Rising costs are driving uptake of high-deductible health plans and HSA (Health Savings Account) utilization; yet 67% of HSA-users find them hard to use and frustrating to manage.

Remote work is growing, but health benefits aren't made for remote workforces. US healthcare is a regional business, and the carrier's plan is underwritten out of the zip code where the company is headquartered. Employees that live in different states face coverage issues due to this model, since there are no perfect national provider networks. With 70% of new startups today offering remote roles, modern workforces struggle to get good group coverage.

New regulation is bringing improved choice and flexibility to health benefits. Employees can now purchase individual coverage policies and get reimbursed through their employer. The ICHRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement), passed in 2020, enables this experience and satisfies the employer mandate. In 2 years, up to 3 million employees have enrolled in an ICHRA, and the Department of Labor predicts 12 million over the next few years.

Healthcare costs are spiraling out of control. The cost of healthcare in the U.S consistently grows faster than inflation, and over 100 million Americans owe medical debt totaling up to $1T. Every day, families go bankrupt due to exorbitant medical bills, put off life-saving treatment due to costs, and suffer extreme anxiety being hounded by debt collectors.

# Why Us?
Adam Stevenson spent 7 years at Stripe, founding, scaling, and leading multiple technical teams. He previously spent 6 years working in healthcare on security engineering at Kindred Healthcare and Humana, and has built and sold several bootstrapped SaaS products.

Chris Ellis led go-to-market strategy at Agilent for the clinical software portfolio and started the US sales team at healthcare software startup Sophia Genetics. He completed his graduate thesis in Biology at MIT and conducted clinical research at both Duke and MD Anderson.

Our team has deep expertise in both healthcare and fintech, having sold clinical software and built payments and ecommerce systems at high-growth startups like Stripe, Shopify, and Robinhood. We're applying best practices from fintech to the massive underserved market of healthcare.

# How It Works
Founders sign up for Thatch in a few minutes, fully self-serve. They enter a few pieces of information about their startup, then define an all-in healthcare budget. They are prompted to connect their payroll system (via Finch) and bank account (via Plaid). Thatch ingests active employee data from payroll, and the founder clicks a button to invite their team to sign up.

Employees purchase healthcare with the Thatch card. The employee buys health, dental, and vision insurance through an ICHRA facilitated by the card. This card also pays for out-of-pocket expenses tax-free, as well as digital health products and services curated on the Thatch platform. Thatch can attach HSA accounts for eligible employees on the same card.

Modern fintech primitives make the experience 10x better. Consumer-directed healthcare products are confusing, legacy technologies that have seen little innovation. We're changing that:
*   HSAs are painful because nobody knows how much they'll spend in a year. We fund HSA purchases just-in-time so that employees can spend tax-free without needing to estimate their expenses. Nobody else is doing this, and we've filed a provisional patent for this method.
*   We provide a natural language interface via SMS that Thatch users can text 24/7 to ask questions or get help. We use OCR and AI-driven receipt matching to track qualified medical expenses (like Ramp). The user can also query the same interface to ask about HSA item eligibility, balances, and more via a custom bot we've built with GPT4.
*   ICHRAs are brand new, and present an opportunity to rethink the way employees receive and pay for healthcare. The existing implementations (Take Command, People Keep, etc.) have a suboptimal payroll and payments experience. There's little automation, and employers have to reconcile payments every month through manual payroll files. Employees often have to float the premium on their personal card and obtain reimbursement. With Thatch, ICHRAs are totally automated; if an employee purchases a $600/month plan but the employer ICHRA budget is $500/month, the remaining $100/month is pulled programmatically from payroll. We provide an experience that's similar to group coverage, but much more flexible.

# Value Proposition
Thatch saves founders dozens of hours per year. Today, founders must talk with a broker to get health insurance, trade PDFs to enroll employees, and then respond to frequent issues that arise with delayed enrollments, missed coverage, employee complaints, or carrier screw-ups. Adding on supplemental benefits like HSAs, or mental health coverage, is also a painful, manual process. With Thatch, founders sign up completely self-serve in 5 minutes without talking to a human. The complexity of choosing a plan and administering it gets passed onto Thatch.

Thatch puts founders in control of their healthcare budget. Today, founders try to combat carrier rate hikes by taking on the administrative nuisance of rolling their company up into a PEO, running competitive RFPs with carriers at open enrollment, or switching brokers. With Thatch, the founder is in control of their healthcare budget down to the last dollar. Thatch is the optimal way to control costs because the founder sets their own budget.

Thatch helps founders give their team the healthcare experience they deserve. Today, employer healthcare is a one-size-fits-all approach. The same few options for insurance and benefits are averaged out to maximize utilization across the broadest employee pool. With Thatch, the employee curates their own personalized healthcare experience through the marketplace of digital health products, services, and insurance. The same budget is allocated much more efficiently because employees are incentivized to optimize for maximum personal benefit.

# Traction
As of May 1, we're live with the ICHRA, HSA and digital health marketplace. We launched a private beta in January with a healthcare card for out-of-pocket expenses and HSA to get a few months testing key funds flows and payroll deductions. In March we launched our marketplace of healthcare goods and services. We have 5 early stage tech startups who are operational on our beta product paying $19PEPM (per employee per month).

We have over a dozen startups on a waitlist for the full platform. After launching publicly in TechCrunch in February, we had 40 inbound demo requests that included 18 qualified prospects. We're sprinting rapidly toward the minimum viable platform that gives startups a turnkey benefits experience, as overwhelmingly this is the solution founders want. We're onboarding the next 5 additional customers off the waitlist in May for a plan start date of 7/1.

We must accelerate to complete the full platform in time for open enrollment this year. We're raising capital to accelerate our product roadmap so that we're ready to satisfy demand ahead of open enrollment 2023. We are pulling forward key investments to become broker of record, build out the go-to-market team, and ramp up R&D to capitalize on a full, annual cycle of customer feedback. With the rest of the market pulling back on point solutions, we believe that now is the time to press forward with an all-in-one platform.

# Go-To-Market
Onboarding is self-serve. Because the founder signs up from our public site and directly connects their payroll and banking data, we don't require significant resources to onboard customers. Self-serve benefits is a very novel concept in the space; there's a huge opportunity to be the only PLG (Product-Led Growth) healthcare product in the market.

Our sales cycle is short. Half the prospects we talked to — cold inbound demo requests — agreed to use some version of Thatch (HSA only, HSA+ICHRA) in a single 30 minute Zoom call. Our initial ICP is early stage tech startups, where the founder can make a decision in a few minutes. The sales cycle could get more complex as we move upmarket and the buyer changes (CFO, Head of People, etc).

Early distribution will be through startup-focused channels. Our goal is to be the default healthcare choice for new forward-thinking companies. When we're ready, we plan to work with the internal teams at our VC firms to be the default recommendation for startups bringing on benefits for their teams.

Partnership opportunities are abundant. They come in a few general flavors:
*   Payroll providers. Payroll providers want to provide simple benefits solutions to their customers in exchange for a revshare. We're in conversations with Gusto about replacing their current tax-advantaged accounts offering, along with new tech-forward payroll providers like Every.io.
*   Carriers. Health insurance companies are interested in partnering with Thatch because our HSA makes their HDHP (high deductible health plan) offerings more appealing, and because with ICHRA, we can guide individuals to choose their plans. We're in early discussions with Oscar about advancing their ICHRA efforts, and we've chatted with Sana about co-selling Thatch's HSA with their HDHP offering.
*   Brokers. On the ICHRA side, brokers have an opportunity to earn commission on the employees they enroll. HealthSherpa, a large exchange, has offered to pay us $120 per successful enrollment. Willis Towers Watson's brokerage and benefits group was interested in licensing/reselling Thatch's ICHRA platform, and they estimated that they could enroll 50-60,000 commercial lives in 2024. On the HSA side, brokers are tired of incumbent HSA solutions and how cumbersome they are to implement:
    *   "Why are brokers looking for alternatives? Because your competition is bloated, out of touch, and complicated. If you can streamline this approach for us, you'll increase your reach as you find more consistent broker partners to work with." (From Jeremy Wolf at Lovitt Touche, a Marsh McLennan company)

# Market Opportunity
Thatch has multiple revenue opportunities. Most are not exposed to the end customer, which gives us a lot of flexibility to experiment with the business model. We're currently live with S&S, Interchange, Marketplace rake, and HSA yield. The revenue potential per employee ($1,168.50 per year) is calculated from 5 different streams of revenue:
*   S&S (Software and Services): $228 per employee, per year
    *   $19PEPM (Per Employee, Per Month) x 12 mo = $228
*   Interchange: $172.50 per employee, per year
    *   $1,650 (average out of pocket costs) x 1% (debit interchange)= $16.50
        *   Note, our interchange rate would be higher on a credit BIN than a debit BIN
    *   $400 (marketplace spend) x 1% = $4
    *   $15,200 (average premium spend per employee across individual and family plans) x 1% = $152
*   Marketplace rake: $60 per employee, per year
    *   $400 (average marketplace spend prediction) x 15% (partner rake) = $60
*   HSA Yield: $100 per employee, per year
    *   $10,000 x 1% yield = $100
        *   Note, yield is much higher today as rates are up
*   Broker of record fee: $608 per employee, per year
    *   $15,200 (average premiums) x 4% (average ACA broker fee) = $608
        *   Note, we're not currently BOR (Broker of Record), which would allow us to earn a fee on the plans. This is a big motivator for pulling a capital raise forward; there's a significant opportunity in becoming BOR, but it would take additional operations and engineering resources.

The market opportunity is up to $146B. The bear, target, and bull cases are:
*   The SMB / startup market (between 10 to 50 employees) is $28B, assuming 24m lives
*   Plus SMB + mid-market (sub-1000) is $85B, assuming 73m total lives
*   If ICHRA displaces the self-insured market, the total opportunity could be $146B+, assuming 125m total lives

We'll expand horizontally into the broader SMB market. 2 of the prospects who were willing to sign up on the spot were tech-forward SMBs, another was a small nonprofit. The major difference between startup and SMB will be the budget SMBs are willing to allocate to healthcare, impacting interchange from premiums.

Longer term, we'll move upmarket with ICHRA as a tailwind. The more lives in the ICHRA market, the more competitive the plans will become. Carriers will prefer ICHRA because they have an opportunity to build brand loyalty; consumers can choose to renew with the same carrier. The trend of the past 3 years is that individual coverage plans are getting cheaper and better; play this forward 10 years, and they'll increasingly displace group plans upmarket. In early discussions with Oscar's corporate strategy group, they see ICHRA as an opportunity to win share from larger incumbents in the large employer market and are beginning to scope out more competitive plans.

# Product Roadmap
There is significant product surface area to build into following the Series A:
*   Pursue direct payroll integrations with the vendors not covered by Finch
*   Explore alternate banking partnerships with more favorable economics
*   Migrate from our debit BIN to a credit BIN to secure a higher interchange rate
*   Build on top of ACA Marketplace APIs to own plan selection in-house
*   Set our product up to support distribution through partners we're in early conversations with (Gusto, Every, Sana Benefits, Willis Towers Watson, Oscar etc.)
*   Build out functionality in our hosted marketplace for conversion tracking, analytics, etc.
*   Build out HSA investment capabilities
*   Obtain lending licenses so we can offer tax-free BNPL through our HSA product
*   Add on FSA to the mix to get 100% coverage for tax-free purchases for all plans

Longer term, we're excited to partner with carriers to pull EOB data programmatically, file claims more easily, and potentially impact steerage. As we gather a critical mass of data, we believe there's a huge opportunity to leverage AI for more sophisticated matching algorithms that pre-select the optimal plan for an individual based on demographic data in payroll.

# Competition
We're creating an all-in-one healthcare experience. Traditionally, employers either (1) use their payroll provider's default bundled options for healthcare for the sake of convenience or (2) stitch together many different healthcare point solutions. As payroll systems become interoperable (via new APIs like Finch), increasingly payroll and healthcare will be unbundled. Thatch aims to pair the improved experience of an all-in-one solution with the convenience of fully integrated payroll connectivity.

It will be difficult for incumbents to copy Thatch. Nobody in the industry has yet come close to nailing ICHRA (from plan selection, to relationships with carriers and brokers, managing enrollment and building on the marketplace APIs etc.). It will be difficult for a non-healthcare company like Rippling or Ramp to bolt-on a great ICHRA experience because of its significant complexity. Incumbents that are too employer-focused could also struggle with the portability of ICHRA, where a great consumer experience beyond the employer will be essential.

# Vision
ICHRA plans could become so compelling that the old group coverage and self-insurance model is replaced almost entirely with individual coverage plans. Individuals seamlessly bring Thatch from job to job like a portable healthcare “super-app," plugging into a new employer's ICHRA plan easily. The current paradigm of switching insurance when changing employers is inefficient, and individuals should not have to reset their health benefits with every job change.

We believe that the future of healthcare is patient-centric. By empowering the consumer to have transparency and choice about how they spend their healthcare dollars - from their insurance policy to their local physician to perks like 23andMe - we can change the way healthcare works. True consumer choice could bring real market forces into healthcare, making the entire industry more competitive, more efficient, more profitable, and better for patients. Thatch is accelerating the transition to a patient-centric healthcare system.

# APPENDIX
## What is ICHRA (ELI5)?
The current model of fully insured health insurance requires an employer to speak with a broker who sources "group coverage” plans from various carriers. In a small company, it's not uncommon for an employer to then ask their employees which carrier they prefer; inevitably some people end up getting a carrier they don't want. Every year, carriers hike prices and employers must decide between investing time to run a process to find a cheaper plan, or investing money to keep up with the premium rate increases.

The Obama administration introduced the ACA (Affordable Care Act) Marketplace, an exchange where individuals can purchase individual coverage policies from different carriers directly. In 2020, a new law passed allowing employers to reimburse employees for plans that they purchase on the individual coverage marketplace through ICHRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement). Employers define a contribution (say $500/mo), and the employee can use those funds to purchase their own policy. Anything above the amount the employer pays, the employee is responsible, effectively capping the employer contribution.

## What role do brokers play with ICHRA today?
Brokers can earn commission on individual coverage health plans, which is similar to the model in group coverage. ICHRA brokers like Stride have shared that the commission is on average roughly 4% of the value of the plan. There are brokerages like healthsherpa.com that assist individuals with enrollment on the ACA Marketplace for a commission from the carriers, as well as ICHRA solutions like Take Command that sell to employers and help the employees enroll while serving as broker of record (BOR).

Larger groups that we've talked with like MMA are still making up their minds about the ICHRA model. The group coverage commission structure is highly lucrative, and it's more work to enroll the same number of people in ICHRA. Unless it becomes equally straightforward for brokers to make the same amount of money on ICHRA, or the employer experience is significantly better on ICHRA, it will take time before this is a solution the kingmaker brokers promote to larger clients.

## What are the existing products available for firms that choose to go with ICHRA?
There are mainly a handful of more traditional companies that pivoted into ICHRA when the law came out in 2020:
*   Stride Health, which is more focused on the gig economy and contractors
*   PeopleKeep, primarily focused on 'blue collar' sub-50 employers
*   Take Command, which has a mix from small to larger companies 2,000+ (heard this from former employees)
*   Savvy, which was acquired by Take Command after struggling with operational issues

We've chatted with both the founders and users of each of these products; interestingly, none of them have truly integrated/automated payments or payroll, nor are they pursuing the market we're most interested in (high-growth startups that want more easier, more flexible benefits for their teams). JD Cleary, one of the early employees at PeopleKeep, told us technology startups are the ideal market - but they had a hard time serving them as they expect a more streamlined experience.

## What data can you share on adoption and segmentation?
The DOL expects over the next 5-10 years 800k employers and 11m employees will migrate to ICHRA for insurance. We believe that as demand in the ICHRA market grows and plans become more competitive on cost, there's a scenario where ICHRA replaces the fully-insured market (or perhaps one day, self-insured).

ICHRA is only 3 years in, so there's a limited amount of information available on adoption. The HRA Council offered some stats in their 2022 growth trends report:
*   ICHRA as a whole tripled from 2020 to 2022
*   80% of current employers are sub-20 life groups
*   Large employer groups have grown 10x since introduction of ICHRA

There's a huge opportunity to position ICHRA as a premium solution for startups as our wedge into the market. We've chatted with several startups (Budgie, Pearl, Tava, Turquoise, Float, etc.) who've brought on an ICHRA or considered it because (1) it empowers their team to choose their own plan and (2) they have remote employees who their regional small group plan can't support out-of-state and (3) it allows flexibility to control costs. We decided to pursue ICHRA because the market was pulling it out of us.

Startups who have churned from ICHRA solutions do so because their experience with the provider they use is bad. They say the existing players like Take Command are (1) not "real tech companies" involving lots of manual payroll files, (2) no automated money transfer so individuals have to float premiums on personal cards, (3) the plan selection and curation process is suboptimal and (4) existing solutions don't offer fringe benefits (HSA/FSA and perks like One Medical) etc... Pearl Health surveyed their employees after switching from ICHRA to a PEO, and told us the majority of employees preferred the flexibility of ICHRA to choose their own plan. We view all these problems as solvable with technology and in fact already have a compelling solution for 1, 2, and 4.

## Would Thatch ever become the broker?
We're imagining building the employee plan selection component in-house; imagine we pull some demographic data from payroll, ask a few questions, and then recommend a plan or set of plans (like Nayya but for ICHRA). Then the question becomes; how do they enroll? For the minimum viable platform, we're going to send people to HealthSherpa or healthcare.gov to do so manually. It would be a better user experience if we could actually enroll them ourselves (as broker of record for the individual) behind the scenes so they never have to leave the Thatch platform; simply choose a plan and they're done.

We don't envision building an employer-facing broker product or see Nava for example as competitive, because they're focused on being a tech-forward broker for group coverage. We don't want to get into that space and instead want to focus on individual coverage and use BOR as a means to improve the user experience (and to capture more revenue or unlock distribution). There are a lot of strategic advantages to focusing our strategy on individual coverage; the employee can continue to use Thatch (keep their HSA, their plan, etc.) after they leave their company, they have ultimate flexibility in how they spend their healthcare dollars, and it removes the burden entirely from employers.

## What's to stop some other funded startup from copying Thatch?
Intellectual property. We opted to invest in IP early because what we're doing is legitimately innovative and our lawyers believe there's a real IP claim to blocking other companies from copying our "Just-in-Time" funding technology. We have a provisional patent, and although there's no guarantee this investment will pay off, it could be a powerful moat.

Network effects. A big part of our product is a marketplace of digital health products and services that individuals can use their tax-free dollars to spend on. There's a virtuous cycle whereby we acquire more users, acquire more partners, pass on greater discounts, etc., that makes it hard for an incumbent to clone those hard-won relationships.

Regulatory and domain complexity. We're sitting at the intersection of 2 very regulated and complex fields; healthcare and finance. We managed to short-circuit the finance side by hiring senior software engineers from mainly Stripe and Shopify and finding great advisors on the healthcare side (like the og HSA guru, Roy Ramthun). Talking with founders and employees from companies like Take Command, People Keep, Savvy, etc. we keep hearing “payments is the hard part". We've not seen a fintech-focused team like ours tackling this problem.

Escape velocity. There's likely room for many $10B+ outcomes in this space. But we're moving quite quickly already (burned $2m and hired a team of top engineers, shipped a basic but compelling solution that's never existed before), so it's exciting to think about what we could accomplish with sustained investment such that new startups couldn't catch up.
