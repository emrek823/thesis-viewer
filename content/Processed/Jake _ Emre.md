### Jake’s Healthcare Vision

- Core beliefs for new healthcare business:
	- Making healthcare invisible - masking it behind something else
	- Give consumers something they want that’s masked or recurring
	- Healthcare is local and physical
	- Small micro brick and mortar footprint
- Entry point: Labs and primary care
- AI and technology underpinning everything
- Insight: Forward Health proved sleek clinics don’t drive recurring engagement
- Opportunity: Consumers spending heavily on wellness adjacent (Function, Superpower, Whoop, Sweetgreen)
- Concept: “Blank Street meets Forward” - wellness engagement mechanism with diagnostic entry point

### Brick & Mortar Healthcare Economics Discussion

- Jake seeking perspective on venture financing for physical healthcare locations
- Eamon’s autism clinic model as example:
	- $50k actual brick and mortar setup costs
	- $250k total including conservative hiring assumptions
	- 6-8 patients needed to break even per clinic
	- $100k+ annual revenue per patient
	- Negative CAC (billing $150-200 for assessments)
- Key success factors:
	- Hiring quality RBTs (biggest risk)
	- Payer contracting challenges with Medicaid
	- Clinical model differentiation (NDBI vs traditional ABA)

### Healthcare Investment Insights

- Brick and mortar can achieve 25-30% EBITDA margins vs typical 12-15%
- Charlie Health virtual model example: 75% gross margins but terrible operating margins due to high CAC
- Importance of looking beyond gross margins to full P&L
- Debt financing possible for clinic models due to predictable reimbursement contracts

### Function/Superpower Business Models

- Current value proposition mainly volume discounts on lab tests
- Jake’s experience with longevity doctor (J. Haryani) - exploring democratization
- Potential differentiation through genomics and individual variant analysis
- Sonata Health (David Dang, Sagan Schultz) working on machine learning based genetic penetrance
- Need longitudinal data at scale to move beyond population averages

### Next Steps

- Jake to send additional ideas he’s exploring
- Emre to share Roads blog on healthcare roll-ups
- Continue dialogue on healthcare business models
- Jake exploring co-founder search for healthcare venture
