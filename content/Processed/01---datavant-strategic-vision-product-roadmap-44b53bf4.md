# Datavant Strategic Vision & Product Roadmap

Q4 2019

## Strategic Vision

Datavant's vision is to connect the world's health data to improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this, we will work with every organization that is exchanging data across the healthcare system and enable every use case that requires data at scale. That includes life sciences companies, payers, providers; the analytics companies and aggregators who provide services to them; and all of the health data sources across the ecosystem, including traditional and non-traditional sources.

We will realize this vision in three stages:

**Datavant Vision Stages & Key Focus Areas**

*   **Phase 1:** Minimum viable network
*   **Phase 2:** Commercial data ubiquity
*   **Current State:** Today (transitioning from Phase 2 to Phase 3)
*   **Phase 3:** Unlock novel solutions that require data density
    *   Trial Tokenization
    *   Patient finder
    *   Value-based care
    *   Participate in every clinical workflow
*   **Long-term Goal:** ~$2B ARR \*

---

*   **Phase 1: Build a Minimum Viable Data Network.** The goal for this stage is to build relationships with enough data sources to be relevant to data users, and to build relationships with enough data users to be relevant to data sources. Datavant crossed this threshold in 2019.
*   **Phase 2: Achieve Commercial Data Ubiquity.** The goal at this stage is to be working with every player in the healthcare system that is working with commercial health data. That means closing deals with the remaining analytics companies and aggregators we don't serve today, and to chase the long tail of sources in each category. The key, however, is what we do next.
*   **Phase 3: Unlock Novel Solutions & Channels.** Having a common Patient Key and connectivity solution used across the entire healthcare system will allow Datavant to not only support existing use cases, but also to unlock new ones that require (i) ubiquity, (ii) a neutral connectivity company, and (iii) security and privacy architecture at scale. We believe that there are a number of solutions that can be developed on top of an open data ecosystem, and each is a billion dollar company in its own right.

Within 5 years, Datavant's health data network will have changed the way decisions are made in healthcare in the United States and increasingly across the world. We are motivated to create a world where every decision made about the efficacy of a drug/device, every complicated diagnosis and every course of treatment is made based on technology enabled by our data network. Whenever two parties exchange health data, Datavant should be powering it, and data should be touching every single decision made in the health system.

## Achieving Commercial Data Ubiquity

Datavant's business is built upon having the largest data ecosystem (both in number and type of sources) with which customers can exchange data. Some data types are critical to certain use cases (e.g., retail pharmacy data for commercial analytics, or mortality data for outcomes research), and Datavant needs to ensure that this data is available in our ecosystem. Further, some use cases like rare disease patient finding require matching to a broad set of data sources (e.g. all providers in the United States) so that every patient can be found. To power all of these commercial use cases, we need to ensure that we have ubiquity across the required data sources.

### Data Ecosystem

Datavant will identify key data sources that are required to power our customers' use cases. Many of these data sources (e.g., genetics testing labs, consumer demographics and behavior, etc. will be amenable to our traditional sales approach, but others may only join our ecosystem through partnerships such as we have built with PCORnet, Prognos and, soon, Symphony.

### Partner Ecosystem

Getting to ubiquity is not limited to efforts with data sources. In addition to de-identification and linking, there are a number of other processes that need to be conducted on a data set before it is actually ready for analytics. Rather than building a Datavant solution for each of these processes on top of our tokens, we believe we can get to ubiquity faster by getting existing providers of these tools to integrate our tokens / tokenization software into their workflows.

Datavant has identified a number of processes that typically must be performed on a data set before it can be used for analytics. We will approach mature vendors of these processes to form reselling partnerships, where the partner agrees to integrate Datavant tools within their processes. The partner will be empowered to resell the Datavant solution directly to their client base, and clients benefit from having access to an end-to-end solution with a single contract.

Health data processes needed in a frictionless ecosystem are shown in the table below, along with target reselling partners who currently provide those services:

## Unlocking Novel Solutions

A core premise of Datavant's strategy is that, by building a ubiquitous, open Health Data Network, we are positioned to generate more "data density" than has ever existed within healthcare. Datavant's business model begins to break-out when we have a critical mass of data density to unlock use cases that have never been possible before.

With sufficient data density, we believe we can power solutions that have historically been impossible, ranging from connecting real world evidence and clinical trial data to undiagnosed rare disease patient finding to value-based care. We also can ultimately impact all forms of clinical care where exogenous data is relevant.

Datavant has developed beachhead clients for these solutions, and will continue to invest in their expansion as we move into phase 3 of our strategy:

**Clinical Trial Tokenization:** Clinical trials are an incredibly expensive and time intensive endeavor, and if mismanaged or poorly designed, can fail and destroy the brand's revenue potential and deny patients a potentially effective therapy. Likewise, the required investment in each trial means that company's do as few as necessary, often choosing not to do long term trials nor to investigate label extensions to serve smaller patient populations. By including Datavant tokens within clinical trial records, sponsors and CROs have the opportunity to:

*   Improve 'long term surveillance' and observational studies
    *   Patient outcomes can be tracked using real world data (RWD) on a longer time horizon, and for much lower cost, than the traditional study length.
    *   Sponsors can prove safety and efficacy to the FDA, and support their pricing and formulary placement with payers based on improved outcomes.

Page 3 of 10

*   Improved data analysis
    *   Enable post-hoc patient stratification based on RWD variables not included in the trial design (e.g., "Did the trial work in certain subpopulations better than others?")
    *   Include data in later analyses, and across trials (e.g., including phase III trial patients in long term phase IV observational trials without needing to re-recruit them)
    *   Tracking exogenous/extraneous variables that may influence study outcome to explain non-responders and adverse events that threaten the success of the trial and the drug candidate
*   Support recruitment efforts
    *   Use linked data to know where patients fulfilling specific inclusion/exclusion criteria are located, and your success in enrolling them
    *   Exchange Patient Keys across other studies/sponsors to help identify and remove "career patients" who may taint study outcomes

**Commercial Data Linking.** The commercial sector of life sciences (biotech, pharma, and medtech) has long been a primary buyer of health data. IQVIA and Symphony are dominant players in this sector, and focus on providing retail pharmacy prescription and claims data to pharma brand teams. Datavant's solution offering to this market is the ability to link additional data to IQVIA or Symphony data that is already in use by target customers in order to expand the accuracy, breadth, and insight of analytics being run for commercial use cases. The following commercial applications can be powered by linked data:

*   **Market research and forecasting** - Data is used primarily to understand the patient journey through a disease state, including the volume of patients at each stage to predict market size.
*   **Sales Targeting and Compensation** - Data is used primarily to create both the territory allocation plan and compensation strategy for sales representatives.
*   **Marketing Targeting and Measurement (Commercial Effectiveness)** - Data is used to understand which physician, patient, and payer segments to target with non-personal-promotion (marketing campaigns), and includes activation through media channels to place ads in front of targeted individuals. Effectiveness of these promotions is measured by looking at the conversion rate of targeted individuals to the desired behavior (e.g. prescribing a drug, visiting a website, seeing a doctor).
*   **Brand Analytics** - De-identified patient-level data sets are used to measure commercial KPIs like patient compliance, persistency, product switching, share and counts, and diagnosis.

Page 4 of 10

*   **Managed Markets / Market Access** - Data is used to understand how well brands perform when reimbursed by different health plans, and how formulary position, prior authorization, and step therapy restrictions impact prescription trends.
*   **Medical Affairs / HEOR** - Data is used to support medical affairs and health economics groups as they seek to use real world evidence to support favorable approval and reimbursement of brands by payers by showing better safety or efficacy, and by showing reduced health costs overall among brand users.

**Patient Finding.** In Datavant's ecosystem, sophisticated analytics occur in a de-identified context, using large amounts of de-identified patient data to build advanced analytics and AI algorithms. For several use cases, clients wish for providers to be able to directly contact a specific list of deidentified tokens (for example, if a list of tokens corresponds to likely undiagnosed rare disease patients, providers may wish to understand who those patients actually are). Our vision is to build a bi-directional network that enables providers (covered entities under HIPAA) to re-identify lists of patients in the course of patient care -- unlocking better treatment of undiagnosed patients, faster clinical trial recruitment, and more:

*   **Undiagnosed rare disease patients** - using de-identified data pools, analytics companies can determine patients who are likely undiagnosed for a particular rare disease
*   **Clinical trial recruitment** - providers can receive alerts for patients who are eligible for clinical trials based on disease models built on linked data sets
*   **Treatment intervention** - eventually, all artificial intelligence that occurs in the clinical workflow should happen on top of de-identified data -- and then be reidentified just-in-time at the point of care.

## Unlocking Channel Partners

Today, Datavant works indirectly with life science companies, payers, and providers. Dramatically scaling our presence in these segments to establish direct contact with these high-value customers requires finding the right channel partners to sell into those accounts, which use large amounts of data, but are often reliant on the analytics companies and aggregators that Datavant is focused on winning in Phase 2. We are well positioned to exploit our technology and ecosystem. Examples of key strategic partnerships we will secure to be successful in Phase 3 include:

**Channel Partners to Unlock Clinical Solutions.** Working with top CROs and companies in the business of supporting R&D efforts in pharma & biotech can allow Datavant's technology to be seamlessly integrated into clinical trials, unlocking new data linking possibilities. Example partners are:

*   Parexel
*   Medidata
*   REDCap
*   Medrio
*   Castor

**Channel Partners to Unlock Commercial Solutions.** Working with key commercial data sources and analytics companies gives Datavant a clear value proposition to commercial pharma brand and market access teams: linking data to better understand the customer journey. Example partners are:

*   Symphony
*   Optum
*   Prognos
*   Veeva
*   ZS Associates
*   McKinsey

## International Expansion

These three phases to achieving our vision are all focused in the United States. However, many of our analytics and life-sciences customers and partners operate globally, and we plan to work with them as the company scales to enter new geographies for a variety of different use cases.

## Product Roadmap

To accomplish Datavant's strategic vision to connect the world's health data, we are building a health data network that provides the platform and solutions necessary to enable the safe and frictionless exchange of health data.

### First Principles

Building a ubiquitous health data network will require a product strategy tightly aligned with Datvant's strategic vision. Our product strategy is guided by several first principles:

*   **Data sources should be able to distribute data safely, with minimal friction, and with complete control.**
    *   **Safely** means that the data should be as secure as possible (minimal risk of breach, minimal materiality of breach, and control from misuse by third parties), and in compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and ethical best practices.

Page 6 of 10

    *   **Minimal friction** means eliminating the technical, logistical, compliance, and contractual frictions involved in data sharing. In other words, decisions around data sharing should be purely about business strategy, not logistical constraints.
    *   **Control** means visibility into, and decision authority over, all aspects of how the data source's information is used, contracted for, protected, and priced, even after the data has been distributed to other parties.
*   **Data consumers should be able to access an open ecosystem of data sources and applications with minimal friction.**
    *   **Open ecosystem** means that any business or institution can participate, and the network treats them neutrally.
    *   **Minimal friction** for data consumers means eliminating the technical, logistical, compliance, and contractual frictions involved in consuming best-of-breed data and applications. In other words, decisions around data use should be purely about the quality and cost/accessibility of data, not logistical constraints.
*   **Patients should be able to access data about themselves, and have access to use it (or authorize their provider to access it) for better care.**

Needless to say, these principles are not how healthcare works today. Companies more often compete on data than share it. When they do share it, the process is full of friction and risk (de-identification, compliance, and data linkage is often solved company-by-company with home-grown solutions). And the sources that do make their data available must give up significant control in order to do so, losing visibility into who is using their data and for what purposes. While patients have a legal right to access their data, in practice the data is so viscous that patient data access is extremely limited.

Datavant is uniquely positioned to implement these first principles through our products. The huge responsibility that comes with operating a health data network at this scale requires an unshakeable foundation both technically and from a security perspective. This means software that looks even better under the hood and enables rapid development and adaptation to new technical environments, data formats and interfaces. And it means we both reduce the potential for and impact from a breach (on data or our secrets).

### Phases of Our Product Vision

Our product vision is tightly tied to our overall strategic vision:

**Next 1-2 years (Phase 2).** Our top company and product priority is finishing our march towards ubiquity in de-identified commercial datasets. To date we have captured the motivated and existing parts of the market -- companies like Veradigm, DRG, Komodo and Clarify. But from a

Page 7 of 10

market-facing perspective, 2020 will be the year where our ecosystem will become simple enough to join and simple enough to begin exchanging data that we'll start seeing virality where the business is growing with much less effort.

**2-5 years from now (Phase 3).** We'll be the standard for the exchange of de-identified health data which is enabling thousands of links and, more importantly, powering novel outcomes research, pharma analytics, patient outreach and clinical trial support. Datavant's app ecosystem -- a collection of business partnerships, light technology couplings, and fully developed partner integrations -- is making the end to end process of exchanging data an order of magnitude easier than it is today.

## 2020 Product Roadmap

We are developing our products along 3 pillars: **(1) Ecosystem, (2) Privacy, and (3) Simplicity.** Ecosystem refers to reducing the friction from finding and linking with partners. Privacy refers to security, control and policies to protect our ecosystem. Simplicity refers to the technology we've developed to facilitate the simple de-identification, linking and matching of siloed datasets. In 2020, we will deliver the following:

### Ecosystem

*   Launch Ecosystem Finder, focused on making it easy to identify relevant sources to support a particular use case (50+ findable sources)
*   Distribution as default & in our web Portal, cutting friction out of the workflow for our sources who are not prepared to handle distribution independently (25+ sources)
*   Bridging workflows standard and productized

### Privacy

*   Strengthen security architecture by implementing additional protections against re-identification attacks
*   More control on data flows, including the ability to do one-directional links between datasets (Party A can transform Patient Keys into Party B's format to allow Party B to connect data, but not vice versa)
*   Even tighter guards for on-premise software

### Simplicity

*   A next-generation services architecture with multiple functional enhancements to enable more de-identification directly in our tool
*   Expanded ways to tokenze: API/streaming mode to enable partnerships & programmatic processing
*   Robust support for token deployment in clinical trials to end users with limited technical experience

Page 8 of 10

*   Generally available products for unstructured data, matching disparate identifiers, and implementing a UI to run the software for non-power users

## Launch of Trial Tokenization

Much of our product work goes to building the core platform focused on removing friction from data exchange while protecting patient privacy and data security. The platform is what allows the health data network to grow, and is the foundation for everything else that we do.

As the Datavant Patient Key becomes increasingly ubiquitous across the healthcare ecosystem, we also have the opportunity to roll out new solutions, which were not previously possible. The first of these is trial tokenization, which we are currently implementing with our partner Parexel across their entire clinical trial portfolio.

The idea behind trial tokenization is simple -- assign each clinical trial participant a Datavant Patient Key. Today, trials are usually run blinded, and the trial data is connected to a Subject ID that does not have meaning outside the context of that trial. Most clinical trials fail, and under the current framework, sponsors are left with a new health data silo. By inserting Datavant Patient Keys into clinical trials, sponsors are granted a new option to link real-world data to clinical trial data for retrospective or prospective analysis.

The effective deployment of trial tokenization is highly cross-functional, and to make this deployment successful, Product must deliver on several new features, including:

*   Scalable framework for distribution to a large number of sites, many of which will be participating in multiple trials simultaneously
*   Intuitive user interface for site coordinators tokenizing patient records
*   Means of handling and tracking patient consent
*   Compliance with 21 CFR Part 11/GXP regulations

We will work hand-in-glove with the Solutions team to implement these features as we deploy across Parexel's portfolio and begin to scale trial tokenization to other pharma companies and contract research organizations.

## Building on 2019

Our confidence in 2020 is informed by our progress in 2019, in which a smaller team was able to deliver a number of new products and tools:

*   We built and launched Portal, an intuitive web-based interface for users to download our software and access other Datavant tools.
    *   Portal now supports 150+ companies and 300+ active users.

Page 9 of 10

    *   Since just November 1st, 50+ users have downloaded DeID/Link from Portal.
*   We launched Discovery, which enables data sources and data users to easily compare their data sets.
*   We rolled out a new version of the software, going from only 11 sites on January 1 to over 150 today.
*   We added the ability to run Link software (which transforms tokens into the correct encryption key) without configuration for an easier UX.
*   Link and DeID services are available for internal use and powering ingestion.
*   We released Match in beta and it is now in testing within PCORnet (People-Centered Outcomes Research Network, comprising >70 academic medical centers and research networks).
