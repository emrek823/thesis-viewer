A digital twin (DT) is a theoretical representation or virtual simulation of an object or system composed of a computer model and real-time data (1). A DT model operates upon information received from sensors reporting about various aspects of the physical system and process, such as temperature, raw-materials levels, and product accumulation. From such data, the model ca can predict specified ntrol (2).

running contemporaneously and support self-monitored processes. Such capabilities excel in networks where continuous information exchange reinforces and improves the virtual representation of a physical system.

This reflects a major feature of DTs —their ability to accommodate multidirectional information flow (Figure 1). For instance, instrument or process sensors transfer information to the DT, providing relevant operational data to the model. A DT can communicate actionable insights to the personnel monitoring a system or to the system itself. By processing continually updated data from multiple areas in the physical system, the powerful virtual environment of a DT represents a system's status much more comprehensively and accurately than classical simulations can.

Such setups have proven to be useful during drug and medical-device development. In this situation, the virtual replica is not informed by real-time data; rather, the models present a static picture of how a physical system operated at a specific time. Data scientists can use such models to understand factors and values that determine the model's broader theoretical framework.

**One-Way Connection:** In this case, connectivity runs from a physical system to a cybercopy. The digital model receives information in real time and updates continuously, enabling it to emulate conditions occurring in the real-world system. A one-way in silico replica can be useful for applying process analytical technology (PAT), real-time monitoring, and remotely initiated process control — all of which can improve an ongoing process.

**Full Connection:** Bidirectional connectivity enables a model to support a physical manufacturing system in a growing number of ways. Real-time updates to the model provide for such activities as intelligent closed-loop control. Thus, batches can be produced in the right way during every iteration through continuous monitoring and “smart” operation. We might think of a fully connected model as an airplane pilot who, in response to schedule changes or atmospheric events, provides input to flight control systems to adjust or maintain a flight path.

Physical reality must be measured and analyzed in real time to produce a contemporary, dynamic digital counterpart of an object or process. DTs are an example of the third scenario described above. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) — including such advances as the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) — has enabled full implementation of DTs.

The associated technologies have advanced to such a point that a properly trained, AI-enabled DT will avoid limitations with customary approaches to process analysis, including poor results from hur pertly correlate reasoning that gen enabled DTs perf ituations in real time trol action been tak d paramet e clear evidence uch values also prov r

## DT Functions and Applications
Scientists who do not work with AI sometimes conflate the different ways in which digital models, such as AI-empowered DT, can be used. That problem can occur even in defined applications such as medical (and now precision) diagnostics and biomanufacturing operations.

AI-supported models serve as tools for descriptive analysis, by which data from past events are collected and simply reported. One step further is a model-based diagnostic analysis, during which a model leverages known data relationships to shed light on correlations and/or causations in past events. Predictive analysis of an operation or tool evaluates past process performance, known associations, and even mechanistic knowledge to generate forecasts of progressive actions. Prescriptive analysis provides actionable insights — e.g., suggested parameter adjustments — to support open-loop process control. In its most advanced form, a model could provide direct and active closed-loop system control by actuating changes in multiple control elements to maintain a process in a desired state. With respect to risk management, it should be noted that an AI-enabled DT in a control loop can take action only upon defined manipulated variables within the system network.

## Why AI Now?
Like the Guttenberg printer and the World Wide Web, OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) language model arguably represents a seismic shift in information technology (IT). That claim might or might not be an exaggeration; history will decide. But recent applications without doubt have categorically changed the world's appreciation of AI's speed, power, and potential. The only serious questions that remain are how to map, regulate, and control such technology.

Although the discipline of AI was created in the 1950s, it is still beginning to fulfill its promises because technologies only now have become powerful enough to feed and support it (see "Milestor not only in academi is quickly adopting adopters" of the te

such problems and are helping to democratize AI and its applications.

Recent applications have brought AI's significant potential to the forefront of society in general. Scientific applications of “narrow” AI, such as the AlphaFold protein-structure database from DeepMind, have revolutionized structural biology by generating remarkably efficient and accurate three-dimensional (3D) protein-structure predictions based on peptide sequences. GPT-4 has inspired widespread debate upon the potentials and pitfalls of products using artificial general intelligence (AGI). For some time, such corporate giants as Google, Amazon, and Netflix have been analyzing consumer data to transform bytes into insights. Now, AI is enabling a transition from insights to knowledge.

AI is being applied in multiple industries and contexts to recognize patterns, detect outliers in data sets, predict outcomes, recommend strategies, control processes, analyze and emulate discrete speech, compose prose and poetry, and process images (3). Its image-processing capability is being exploited in such applications as facial recognition, operation surveillance, and medical-image screening. In diagnostic medicine, AI is used not only to enhance images, but also to screen them for patterns that correlate with particular diseases. Classification and segmentation are key powers of AI, and in medicine and robotics, those abilities are being harnessed to categorize and interpret images and/or to segment them based on their subcomponents.

A properly trained AI algorithm emulates human cognitive attributes within the domain that it addresses. But we humans are still needed to train AI applications in a process called alignment, and humans are needed to ensure that AI is applied, implemented, and maintained correctly.

believe that AI will provide comprehensive solutions to long-standing challenges. Just as robots assist or replace human bodies to perform given tasks, AI emulates human brains to simplify more complex work.

If an algorithm is the powerful engine in an AI-supported model, then data are the fuel. And as with any fuel, performance depends on both quantity and quality. In drug manufacturing, relevant data are generated over time from multiple sources. Advances in process monitoring, including new process analytics and real-time parameter sensors, are increasing bioprocess understanding (5, 6). The emergence of “-omics” fields has done much the same (7, 8). Individual pharmaceutical manufacturers now generate petabytes of such data per year. Unfortunately, that fuel often is stored, not used. Regardless of potential value, when gathered data simply fill digital space, as happens with up to 70% of the information generated at a given biomanufacturing site, companies lose the ability to gain process and product knowledge.

But that tendency is changing as developments in data science complement the aforementioned advances in computing power and data storage, enabling multidisciplinary approaches to ensuring data quality, relevance, and availability. Modern data science now involves mathematics, statistics, advanced programming, and AI to curate and govern large amounts of data for effective and efficient use (9–11). Cloud technologies also are providing the capabilities needed to augment computing disciplines and enable practical application in industry. A new concept termed data intentionality is inspiring alterations in current approaches to data generation and governance. Previously, companies intended to apply generated data for manual analysis and solution discovery. The data-intentionality concept instead suggests that mechanisms for data generation and management should be designed specifically to feed into AI-supported DTs.

to reduce variability in results. Nevertheless, regulatory agencies have encouraged the pharmaceutical industry to address reality as it is, understanding it with all the nuance and complexity upon which it is built (12). Rather than simplify the biological, physical, and chemical nature of biomanufacturing, regulatory administrators now invite companies to use the newest available science to address all relevant parameters, including the inherent variability and complexity of biological products, manufacturing processes, and associated systems (13).

Today, we can evaluate both variability and complexity as natural parameters of a power equation managed by AI (14). In that context, synthetic knowledge refers to the ability of machines to analyze large amounts of dissimilar data, identify patterns, learn from them, and present conclusions or predictions that would be impossible for humans to conceive through even math-supported analysis.

Dismissing the historical approach of making univariate assumptions between predictor and target variables lets us work on reality as it is by means of synthetic knowledge. That includes leveraging AI-supported analysis of the petabytes of data that are collected throughout a drug's product life cycle.

## AI in Today's Pharmaceutical Industry
AI is now a commodity and an accepted part of industry and society. Examples include how we trust "machine vision” to secure our telephones and how we rely on the recommendations of global positioning system (GPS) apps to arrive at our destinations on time. The pharmaceutical industry, too, is adopting the benefits of AI, but in merely opportunistic ways and not under a coherent strategy. AI has been demonstrated to be the best tool to solve problems with product yield, overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), deviation management, anomaly detection, and various demands for pattern recognition. AI is already addressing problems that could not be solved with old methods and technologies (e.g., classical statistics, linear regressio realities of drug dev Bly variable over a cC

## AI Along the Product Life Cycle
Specialization supports excellence in individual disciplines but can limit appreciation of broader implications. Many scientists value the power of AI in their areas of expertise but might be unaware of its growing scope of application throughout the pharmaceutical industry, from target discovery to postmarketing surveillance (15). For example, during product discovery and development, AI now improves construction of design-of-experiments (DoE) approaches based on the full spectrum of parameters influencing the biophysicochemical properties of the systems under investigation (16). In process development, AI is empowering DT analysis of heterogeneous data from numerous analytical instruments and probes, enabling multiparametric simulations (17, 18).

During clinical trials, AI has, for instance, helped to reduce bias in trial design through “in silico trials,” establishing patient-specific models to form virtual cohorts covering understudied populations (16). In process validation, scientists must develop extensive understanding of their analytical methods' accuracy and efficiency. From process design (PD) to process qualification (PQ) and continued process verification (CPV), AI provides powerful tools for multivariate analytics that support real-time process monitoring and control (19).

Quality assurance/control (QA/QC) scientists are leveraging AI to discover and understand critical quality attributes (CQAs) and process parameters (CPP), develop quality control plans (QCPs), maintain electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) and laboratory information-management system (LIMS) dashboards, and support reduction and distribution of new data. In the realm of procurement, from inventory management to accounts receivable, AI supports such core functions as supply-chain management.

and safety compliance; and operational, financial, and contractual activities.

Although many benefits can come from deep understanding gained when AI is applied to historical data, even more possibilities emerge when such knowledge is managed in real time. That strategy requires adequate mechanisms (such as an AI-enabled DT) for consistent, bidirectional information exchange between the physical and virtual worlds. We also should note that it would be an error to create new silos of knowledge by maintaining DTs that do not interact with one another. Only when transverse or lateral processes are connected can you find underlying evidence of complexity across vertical operations within the same unit or network (Figure 2).

[Image: Diagram showing data from a real-world system feeding into multiple digital shadows, creating a network of virtual copies, which then aggregate data to enhance the physical process.]

Bioprocess data come with high dimensionality and complexity, which arise from interactions among multiple variables. The variety of data sources and formats presents operational issues, including variability and "noise” in measurement, both of which diminish standardization and interoperability. Such problems make it difficult, using classical techniques, to identify meaningful patterns within bioprocess data and to understand underlying relationships among many variables.

Advances in process monitoring and analytics have increased the volumes and types of data to be accounted for, driving demand for better data-processing and process-control techniques. Recent developments in automation, process intensification, and continuous processing have magnified such needs.

Meanwhile, data science, algorithmic capability, and computing power have progressed significantly. Currently, the only way to work with the vast stores and many different types of product and process data is through multivariate analysis based on advanced modeling techniques. Increasing standardization in data formats and protocols — and in techniques for data analysis and ML — is enabling researchers and engineers to analyze, model, and control bioprocesses based on data-driven approaches. DTs hold much promise for emulating the complexity of biological processes and for addressing all of the difficulties related to the continuous variability associated with biopharmaceutical operations (20, 21).

**A DT Use Case:** In classical batch manufacturing, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are made in intermittent steps that can take place at different times and even locations. In continuous manufacturing (CM), processes take place in one contiguous train, without interruption and with material charging and product discharging simultaneously. CM is complex, and an advanced dynamic-control system is required to monitor and interact with the equipment and products in real time. For example, it is necessary to control the dosing of starting i g the process. ne CM of sn pport biopharr 's could continuo ing pump improve ontinuous speeds t es (22). Such operatio

## Setting Sail for Bioprocessing 4.0
Advances in process monitoring, data accessibility, and computing power are fueling the power of AI-enabled models, as is the democratization of such technology. DTs can rapidly reduce the high dimensionality, format complexity, and diversity of measurements in biopharmaceutical activities to actionable conclusions. For example, as trained by appropriate subject-matter experts (SMEs), DTs offer the promise of producing all batches under the expected conditions, all day and every day, without operator attention. Bioprocess understanding, development, and control are improving significantly as the industry implements AI-enabled DTs. Jay Baer (president of marketing consultancy Convince & Convert) recently tweeted, “We are surrounded by data but starved for insights." If data are the winds behind Bioprocessing 4.0, then AI-enabled DTs are the sails.
