# BYLAWS

## ARTICLE I — MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

1.1 **Place of Meetings.** Meetings of stockholders of Synthetica Bio, Inc. (the “Company”) shall be held at any place, within or outside the State of Delaware, determined by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”). The Board may, in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting of stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law or any successor legislation (the “DGCL”). In the absence of any such designation or determination, stockholders’ meetings shall be held at the Company’s principal executive office. The Board may cancel, postpone, or reschedule any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders at any time, before or after the notice for such meeting has been given to the stockholders.

1.2 **Annual Meeting.** Unless directors are elected by written consent in lieu of an annual meeting as permitted by Section 211(b) of the DGCL, an annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date and time as may be designated by resolution of the Board from time to time. Stockholders may, unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides, act by written consent to elect directors; provided, however, that, if such consent is less than unanimous, such action by written consent may be in lieu of holding an annual meeting only if all of the directorships to which directors could be elected at an annual meeting held at the effective time of such action are vacant and are filled by such action. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.

1.3 **Special Meeting.** A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board, Chairperson of the Board, Chief Executive Officer or President (in the absence of a Chief Executive Officer).

If a special meeting of the stockholders has been called, the Company shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, in accordance with these bylaws, that a meeting will be held at the time requested by the person or persons calling the meeting. No business may be transacted at such special meeting other than the business specified in such notice to stockholders. Nothing contained in this paragraph of this section 1.3 shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board may be held or the business that may be transacted at such meeting.

1.4 **Notice of Stockholders’ Meetings.** Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be given in accordance with Section 232 of the DGCL and section 7.1 of these bylaws, and such notice shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Except as otherwise provided in the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.

1.5 **Quorum.** Except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of stock

2
having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter, except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairperson of the meeting, or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, in the manner provided in section 1.6 of these bylaws, until a quorum is present or represented.

1.6 **Adjourned Meeting; Notice.** Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place (including an adjournment taken to address a technical failure to convene or continue a meeting using remote communication), and notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are (i) announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, (ii) displayed, during the time scheduled for the meeting, on the same electronic network used to enable stockholders and proxy holders to participate in the meeting by means of remote communication or (iii) set forth in the notice of meeting given in accordance with Section 222(a) of the DGCL and section 1.4 of these bylaws. At the adjourned meeting, the Company may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 213(a) of the DGCL and section 1.10 of these bylaws, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

1.7 **Conduct of Business.** The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall be designated by the Board; in the absence of such designation, the Chairperson of the Board, if any, or the Chief Executive Officer (in the absence of the Chairperson of the Board) or the President (in the absence of the Chairperson of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer), or in their absence any other executive officer of the Company, shall serve as chairperson of the stockholder meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business, and shall have the power to adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date or time, whether or not a quorum is present.

1.8 **Voting.** The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1.10 of these bylaws, subject to Section 217 (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock) and Section 218 (relating to voting trusts and other voting agreements) of the DGCL.

Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder as of the applicable record date which has voting power upon the matter in question. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and, unless otherwise required by law, need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled

3
to vote thereon which are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. If authorized by the Board, such requirement of a written ballot shall be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder.

Except as otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of such class or series or classes or series, except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

1.9 **Stockholder Action by Consent Without a Meeting.** Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by the DGCL to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

A consent must be set forth in writing or in an electronic transmission. No consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Company in the manner required by Section 228 of the DGCL within 60 days of the first date on which a consent is so delivered to the Company. Any person executing a consent may provide, whether through instruction to an agent or otherwise, that such consent will be effective at a future time, including a time determined upon the happening of an event, occurring not later than 60 days after such instruction is given or such provision is made, if evidence of the instruction or provision is provided to the Company. If the person is not a stockholder of record when the consent is executed, the consent shall not be valid unless the person is a stockholder of record as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to the action. Unless otherwise provided, any such consent shall be revocable prior to its becoming effective. All references to a consent in this section 1.9 mean a consent permitted by this section 1.9.

A consent permitted by this section 1.9 shall be delivered (i) to the principal place of business of the Company; (ii) to an officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded; (iii) to the registered office of the Company in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; or (iv) subject to the next sentence, in accordance with Section 116 of the DGCL to an information processing system, if any, designated by the Company for receiving such consents. In the case of delivery pursuant to the foregoing clause (iv), such consent must set forth or be delivered with information that enables the Company to determine the date of delivery of such consent and the identity of the person giving such consent, and, if such consent is given by a person authorized to act for a stockholder as proxy, such consent must comply with the applicable provisions of Section 212(c)(2) and (3) of the DGCL. A consent may be documented and signed in accordance with Section 116 of the DGCL, and when so documented or signed shall be deemed to be in writing for purposes of the DGCL; provided that if such consent is delivered pursuant to

4
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this paragraph, such consent must be reproduced and delivered in paper form.

In the event that the Board shall have instructed the officers of the Company to solicit the vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company, an electronic transmission of a stockholder consent given pursuant to such solicitation, to be effective, must be delivered by electronic mail (as defined in section 7.1 of these bylaws) or facsimile telecommunications to the Secretary or the President of the Company or to a person designated by the Company for receiving such consent, or delivered to an information processing system designated by the Company for receiving such consent.

Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Company as provided in Section 228 of the DGCL. In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any provision of the DGCL, if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such provision shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such provision concerning any vote of stockholders, that consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL.

1.10 **Record Dates.** In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination.

If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the provisions of Section 213 of the DGCL and this section 1.10 at the adjourned meeting.

In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action without a meeting in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company in accordance with Section 228(d) of the DGCL. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

5
In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

1.11 **Proxies.** Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or such stockholder’s authorized officer, director, employee or agent, may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy authorized by a document or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. The authorization of a person to act as a proxy may be documented, signed and delivered in accordance with Section 116 of the DGCL, provided that such authorization shall set forth, or be delivered with information enabling the Company to determine, the identity of the stockholder granting such authorization. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL.

1.12 **List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote.** The Company shall prepare, no later than the tenth day before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The Company shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of ten days ending on the day before the meeting date: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the Company’s principal place of business. In the event that the Company determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Company may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Company.

## ARTICLE II — DIRECTORS

2.1 **Powers.** The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board, except as may be otherwise provided in the DGCL or the certificate of incorporation.

2.2 **Number of Directors.** The Board shall consist of one or more members, each of whom shall be a natural person. Unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors, the number of directors shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director’s term of office expires.

2.3 **Election, Qualification and Term of Office of Directors.** Except as provided in section 2.4 of these bylaws, and subject to sections 1.2 and 1.9 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. The certificate of incorporation or these bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors. Each director shall hold office until such director’s successor is elected and qualified or until such director’s earlier death, resignation or removal.

6
2.4 **Resignation and Vacancies.** Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the Company. A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. A resignation which is conditioned upon the director failing to receive a specified vote for reelection as a director may provide that it is irrevocable. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, when one or more directors resign from the Board, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective.

Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws or permitted in the specific case by resolution of the Board, and subject to the rights of holders of preferred stock of the Company:

(i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.

(ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.

If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the Company should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the DGCL.

If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole Board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the voting stock at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the DGCL as far as applicable.

A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office and until such director’s successor is elected and qualified, or until such director’s earlier death, resignation or removal.

2.5 **Place of Meetings; Meetings by Telephone.** The Board may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware.

Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board, or any committee designated by the Board or any subcommittee, may participate in a meeting of the Board, or any such committee or subcommittee, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

7
2.6 **Conduct of Business.** Meetings of the Board shall be presided over by the Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the Vice Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairperson designated by the Board, or in the absence of such designation by a chairperson chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

2.7 **Regular Meetings.** Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board.

2.8 **Special Meetings; Notice.** Special meetings of the Board for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairperson of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or any two directors; provided that the person(s) authorized to call a special meeting of the Board may authorize another person or persons to send notice of such meeting.

Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be:

(i) delivered personally by hand, by courier or by telephone;

(ii) sent by United States first-class mail, postage prepaid; or

(iii) given by electronic transmission,

directed to each director at that director’s address or telephone number, or by means of electronic transmission, as the case may be, as shown on the Company’s records.

If the notice is delivered personally by hand, by courier, or by telephone, or given by means of electronic transmission, it shall be delivered, sent or otherwise directed to each director, as applicable, at least 24 hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is sent by United States mail, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four days before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice of the time and place of the meeting may be communicated to the director in lieu of written notice if such notice is communicated at least 24 hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. The notice need not specify the place of the meeting (if the meeting is to be held at the Company’s principal executive office) nor the purpose of the meeting, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

2.9 **Quorum; Voting.** At all meetings of the Board, the presence of at least a majority of the directors in office from time to time shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; provided that in no case shall the presence of less than 1/3 of the total authorized directorships constitute a quorum. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

If the certificate of incorporation provides that one or more directors shall have more or less than one vote per director on any matter, every reference in these bylaws to a majority or other proportion of the directors shall refer to a majority or other proportion of the votes of the directors.

2.10 **Board Action by Consent Without a Meeting.** Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, (i) any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting

8
of the Board, or of any committee or subcommittee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee or subcommittee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission; and (ii) a consent may be documented, signed and delivered in any manner permitted by Section 116 of the DGCL. Any person (whether or not then a director) may provide, whether through instruction to an agent or otherwise, that a consent to action will be effective at a future time (including a time determined upon the happening of an event), no later than 60 days after such instruction is given or such provision is made and such consent shall be deemed to have been given for purposes of this section 2.10 at such effective time so long as such person is then a director and did not revoke the consent prior to such time. Any such consent shall be revocable prior to its becoming effective. After an action is taken, the consent or consents relating thereto shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board, or the committee or subcommittee thereof, in the same paper or electronic form as the minutes are maintained.

2.11 **Fees and Compensation of Directors.** Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the Board shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors.

2.12 **Removal of Directors.** Unless otherwise restricted by statute, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any director or the entire Board may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director’s term of office.

## ARTICLE III — COMMITTEES

3.1 **Committees of Directors.** The Board may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Company. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board or in these bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Company, and may authorize the seal of the Company to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority to (i) approve or adopt, or recommend to the stockholders, any action or matter (other than the election or removal of directors) expressly required by the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (ii) adopt, amend or repeal any bylaw of the Company.

3.2 **Committee Minutes.** Each committee and subcommittee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings.

3.3 **Meetings and Actions of Committees.** A majority of the directors then serving on a committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by the committee or subcommittee, unless the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the Board or a resolution of a committee that created the subcommittee requires a greater or lesser number, provided that in no case shall a quorum be less than 1/3 of the directors then serving on the committee or subcommittee. The vote of the majority of the members of a committee or subcommittee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the committee or subcommittee, unless the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the Board or a resolution of a committee that created the subcommittee requires a

9
greater number. Unless the Board otherwise specifies, meetings and actions of committees and subcommittees shall otherwise be governed by, and held and taken in accordance with, the provisions of:

(i) section 2.5 (Place of Meetings; Meetings by Telephone);

(ii) section 2.7 (Regular Meetings);

(iii) section 2.8 (Special Meetings; Notice);

(iv) section 2.9 (Quorum; Voting);

(v) section 2.10 (Board Action by Consent Without a Meeting); and

(vi) section 7.4 (Waiver of Notice)

with such changes in the context of those bylaws as are necessary to substitute the committee or subcommittee and its members for the Board and its members. However:

(i) the time and place of regular meetings of committees or subcommittees may be determined either by resolution of the Board or by resolution of the committee or subcommittee;

(ii) special meetings of committees or subcommittees may also be called by resolution of the Board or the committee or subcommittee; and

(iii) notice of special meetings of committees and subcommittees shall also be given to all alternate members, as applicable, who shall have the right to attend all meetings of the committee or subcommittee. The Board, or, in the absence of any such action by the Board, the committee or subcommittee, may also adopt other rules for the government of any committee or subcommittee.

Any provision in the certificate of incorporation providing that one or more directors shall have more or less than one vote per director on any matter shall apply to voting in any committee or subcommittee, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

3.4 **Subcommittees.** Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws or the resolutions of the Board designating the committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees, each subcommittee to consist of one or more members of the committee, and delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the powers and authority of the committee.

## ARTICLE V — INDEMNIFICATION

5.1 **Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Third Party Proceedings.** Subject to the other provisions of this Article V, the Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereinafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”) (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was a director or officer of the Company serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of *nolo contendere* or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company,

11
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person’s conduct was unlawful.

5.2 **Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Actions by or in the Right of the Company.** Subject to the other provisions of this Article V, the Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereinafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was a director or officer of the Company serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

5.3 **Successful Defense.** To the extent that a present or former director or officer (for purposes of this section 5.3 only, as such term is defined in Section 145(c)(1) of the DGCL) of the Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding described in section 5.1 or section 5.2 of these bylaws, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. The Company may indemnify any other person who is not a present or former director or officer of the Company against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person to the extent he or she has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding described in section 5.1 or section 5.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein.

5.4 **Indemnification of Others.** Subject to the other provisions of this Article V, the Company shall have power to indemnify its employees and agents, or any other persons, to the extent not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable law. The Board shall have the power to delegate to any person or persons identified in subsections (1) through (4) of Section 145(d) of the DGCL the determination of whether employees or agents shall be indemnified.

5.5 **Advanced Payment of Expenses.** Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by an officer or director of the Company in defending any Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of a written request therefor (together with documentation reasonably evidencing such expenses) and an undertaking by or on behalf of the person to repay such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article V or the DGCL. Such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents of the Company or by persons serving at the request of the Company as directors, officers, employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems appropriate. The right to advancement of expenses shall not apply to any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to these bylaws, but shall apply to any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) referenced in section 5.6(ii) or 5.6(iii) of these bylaws prior to a determination that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.

12
5.6 **Limitation on Indemnification.** Subject to the requirements in section 5.3 of these bylaws and the DGCL, the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify any person pursuant to this Article V in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding):

(ii) for an accounting or disgorgement of profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or similar provisions of federal, state or local statutory law or common law, if such person is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements);

(iii) for any reimbursement of the Company by such person of any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by such person from the sale of securities of the Company, in either case as required under any clawback or compensation recovery policy adopted by the Company, applicable securities exchange and association listing requirements, including, without limitation, those adopted in accordance with Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and/or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including, without limitation, any such reimbursements that arise from an accounting restatement of the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), or the payment to the Company of profits arising from the purchase and sale by such person of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), if such person is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements);

(iv) initiated by such person, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by such person against the Company or its directors, officers, employees, agents or other indemnitees, unless (a) the Board authorized the Proceeding (or the relevant part of the Proceeding) prior to its initiation, (b) the Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law, (c) otherwise required to be made under section 5.7 of these bylaws or (d) otherwise required by applicable law; or

(v) if prohibited by applicable law.

5.7 **Determination; Claim.** If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article V is not paid by the Company or on its behalf within 90 days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, the claimant shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of his or her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of expenses. To the extent not prohibited by law, the Company shall indemnify such person against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any action for indemnification or advancement of expenses from the Company under this Article V, to the extent such person is successful in such action. In any such suit, the Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proving that the claimant is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses.

5.8 **Non-Exclusivity of Rights.** The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article V shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation or any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The Company is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advancement of expenses, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable law.

13
5.9 **Insurance.** The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of the DGCL.

5.10 **Survival.** The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this Article V shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

5.11 **Effect of Repeal or Modification.** A right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a provision of the certificate of incorporation or a bylaw shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to or repeal or elimination of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the Proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought, unless the provision in effect at the time of such act or omission explicitly authorizes such elimination or impairment after such action or omission has occurred.

5.12 **Certain Definitions.** For purposes of this Article V, references to the “Company” shall include, in addition to the resulting entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article V with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as such person would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article V, references to “other enterprises” shall include employee benefit plans; references to “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; references to “serving at the request of the Company” shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the Company” as referred to in this Article V.

## ARTICLE VI — STOCK

6.1 **Stock Certificates; Partly Paid Shares.** The shares of the Company shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Company. Unless otherwise provided by resolution of the Board, every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of, the Company by any two officers of the Company representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Company with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. The Company shall not have power to issue a certificate in bearer form.

14
The Company may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the Company in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the Company shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.

6.2 **Special Designation on Certificates.** If the Company is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the Company shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the DGCL, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the Company shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, a statement that the Company will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the registered owner thereof shall be given a notice, in writing or by electronic transmission, containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to this section 6.2 or Sections 156, 202(a), 218(a) or 364 of the DGCL or with respect to this section 6.2 a statement that the Company will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated stock and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall be identical.

6.3 **Lost Certificates.** Except as provided in this section 6.3, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the Company and cancelled at the same time. The Company may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Company may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner’s legal representative, to give the Company a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

6.4 **Dividends.** The Board, subject to any restrictions contained in the certificate of incorporation or applicable law, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of the Company’s capital stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property or in shares of the Company’s capital stock, subject to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation.

The Board may set apart out of any of the funds of the Company available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve.

6.5 **Stock Transfer Agreements.** The Company shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes or series of stock of the Company to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the Company of any one or more classes or series owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the DGCL.

15
6.6 **Registered Stockholders.** The Company:

(i) shall be entitled to treat the person registered on its books as the owner of any share or shares as the person exclusively entitled to receive dividends, vote, receive notifications and otherwise exercise all the rights and powers of an owner of such share or shares; and

(ii) shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

6.7 **Transfers.** Transfers of record of shares of stock of the Company shall be made only upon its books by the holders thereof, in person or by an attorney duly authorized, and, if such stock is certificated, upon the surrender of a certificate or certificates for a like number of shares, properly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer.

## ARTICLE VII — MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE AND WAIVER

7.1 **Delivery of Notice; Notice by Electronic Transmission.**

(a) Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Company under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws may be given in writing directed to the stockholder’s mailing address (or by electronic transmission directed to the stockholder’s electronic mail address, as applicable) as it appears on the records of the Company and shall be given (i) if mailed, when the notice is deposited in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, (ii) if delivered by courier service, the earlier of when the notice is received or left at such stockholder’s address or (iii) if given by electronic mail, when directed to such stockholder’s electronic mail address unless the stockholder has notified the Company in writing or by electronic transmission of an objection to receiving notice by electronic mail or such notice is prohibited by section 7.1(e) of these bylaws. A notice by electronic mail must include a prominent legend that the communication is an important notice regarding the Company.

(b) Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, but subject to section 7.1(e) of these bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the Company under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice or electronic transmission to the Company. The Company may give a notice by electronic mail in accordance with section 7.1(a) of these bylaws without obtaining the consent required by this section 7.1(b).

(c) Notice given pursuant to section 7.1(b) of these bylaws shall be deemed given:

(1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;

(2) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and

(3) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.

16
(d) For purposes of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation and these bylaws, (i) “electronic transmission” means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases), that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process; (ii) “electronic mail” means an electronic transmission directed to a unique electronic mail address (which electronic mail shall be deemed to include any files attached thereto and any information hyperlinked to a website if such electronic mail includes the contact information of an officer or agent of the Company who is available to assist with accessing such files and information); and (iii) “electronic mail address” means a destination, commonly expressed as a string of characters, consisting of a unique user name or mailbox (commonly referred to as the “local part” of the address) and a reference to an internet domain (commonly referred to as the “domain part” of the address), whether or not displayed, to which electronic mail can be sent or delivered.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a notice may not be given by an electronic transmission from and after the time that (i) the Company is unable to deliver by such electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Company and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to discover such inability shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.

(f) An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Company that notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be *prima facie* evidence of the facts stated therein.

(g) No provision of this section 7.1, except for subsections 7.1(a)(i), 7.1(d)(ii) and 7.1(d)(iii), shall apply to Sections 164, 296, 311, 312 or 324 of the DGCL.

7.2 **Notice to Stockholders Sharing an Address.** Except as otherwise prohibited under the DGCL, without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Company under the provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Company. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Company, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the Company of its intention to send the single notice, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.

7.3 **Notice to Person with Whom Communication is Unlawful.** Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the Company is such as to require the filing of a certificate under the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.

7.4 **Waiver of Notice.** Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the

17
time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

    (b) **Lapsed Awards.** If an Award expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, is surrendered pursuant to an Exchange Program, or, with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, is forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to the failure to vest, the unpurchased Shares (or for Awards other than Options or Stock Appreciation Rights the forfeited or repurchased Shares) which were subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). With respect to Stock Appreciation Rights, only Shares actually issued pursuant to a Stock Appreciation Right will cease to be available under the Plan; all remaining Shares under Stock Appreciation Rights will remain available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). Shares that have actually been issued under the Plan under any Award will not be returned to the Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Plan; provided, however, that if Shares issued pursuant to Awards of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company due to the failure to vest, such Shares will become available for future grant under the Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an Award or to satisfy the tax withholdings related to an Award will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan. To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not

-6-
result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.

    (c) **Share Reserve.** The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

4. **Administration of the Plan.**
    (a) **Procedure.**
        (i) **Multiple Administrative Bodies.** Different Committees with respect to different groups of Service Providers may administer the Plan.
        (ii) **Other Administration.** Other than as provided above, the Plan will be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee, which Committee will be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws.
    (b) **Powers of the Administrator.** Subject to the provisions of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator will have the authority, in its discretion:
        (i) to determine the Fair Market Value;
        (ii) to select the Service Providers to whom Awards may be granted hereunder;
        (iii) to determine the number of Shares to be covered by each Award granted hereunder;
        (iv) to approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan;
        (v) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Award granted hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Awards may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the Shares relating thereto (including but not limited to, temporarily suspending the exercisability of an Award if the Administrator deems such suspension to be necessary or appropriate for administrative purposes or to comply with Applicable Laws, provided that such suspension must be lifted prior to the expiration of the maximum term and post-termination exercisability period of an Award), based in each case on such factors as the Administrator will determine;

-7-
        (vi) to institute and determine the terms and conditions of an Exchange Program, including, subject to Section 18(c), to unilaterally implement an Exchange Program without the consent of the applicable Award holder;
        (vii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards granted pursuant to the Plan;
        (viii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of satisfying applicable foreign laws or for qualifying for favorable tax treatment under applicable foreign laws;
        (ix) to modify or amend each Award (subject to Section 18(c) of the Plan), including but not limited to the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Awards and to extend the maximum term of an Option (subject to Section 6(d));
        (x) to allow Participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations in a manner prescribed in Section 14;
        (xi) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;
        (xii) to allow a Participant to defer the receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that otherwise would be due to such Participant under an Award; and
        (xiii) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan.
    (c) **Effect of Administrator’s Decision.** The Administrator’s decisions, determinations and interpretations will be final and binding on all Participants and any other holders of Awards and will be given the maximum deference permitted by Applicable Laws.

5. **Eligibility.** Nonstatutory Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, and Restricted Stock Units may be granted to Service Providers. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees.

6. **Stock Options.**
    (a) **Grant of Options.** Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Options in such amounts as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
    (b) **Option Agreement.** Each Award of an Option will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the exercise price, the term of the Option, the number of Shares subject to the Option, the exercise restrictions, if any, applicable to the Option, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
    (c) **Limitations.** Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. Notwithstanding such designation,

-8-
however, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), such Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 6(c), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, the Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted, and calculation will be performed in accordance with Code Section 422 and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
    (d) **Term of Option.** The term of each Option will be stated in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that the term will be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant thereof. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.
    (e) **Option Exercise Price and Consideration.**
        (i) **Exercise Price.** The per Share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option will be determined by the Administrator, but will be no less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. In addition, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(e)(i), Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Code Section 424(a).
        (ii) **Waiting Period and Exercise Dates.** At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
        (iii) **Form of Consideration.** The Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of: (1) cash (including cash equivalents); (2) check; (3) promissory note, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, (4) other Shares, provided that such Shares have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which such Option will be exercised and provided further that accepting such Shares will not result in any adverse accounting consequences to the Company, as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion; (5) consideration received by the Company under cashless exercise program (whether through a broker or otherwise) implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan; (6) by net exercise, (7) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, or (8) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. In making its determination as to the type of

-9-
consideration to accept, the Administrator will consider if acceptance of such consideration may be reasonably expected to benefit the Company.
    (f) **Exercise of Option.**
        (i) **Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder.** Any Option granted hereunder will be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.

An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives:
(i) notice of exercise (in such form as the Administrator may specify from time to time) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised (together with applicable tax withholding). Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Shares subject to an Option, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 13 of the Plan.

Exercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.

        (ii) **Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider.** If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant’s termination as the result of the Participant’s death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within thirty (30) days of termination, or such longer period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement or in writing by the Administrator (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement) to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
        (iii) **Disability of Participant.** If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant’s Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within six (6) months of termination, or such longer period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement or in writing by the Administrator (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement) to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of

-10-
the Option will revert to the Plan. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
        (iv) **Death of Participant.** If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised within six (6) months following the Participant’s death, or within such longer period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement or in writing by the Administrator (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement) to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death, by the Participant’s designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to the Participant’s death in a form (if any) acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant’s estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant’s will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution (each, a “**Legal Representative**”). If the Option is exercised pursuant to this Section 6(f)(iv), Participant’s designated beneficiary or Legal Representative shall be subject to the terms of this Plan and the Award Agreement, including but not limited to the restrictions on transferability and forfeitability applicable to the Service Provider. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will immediately revert to the Plan. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

7. **Stock Appreciation Rights.**
    (a) **Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights.** Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, a Stock Appreciation Right may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion.
    (b) **Number of Shares.** The Administrator will have complete discretion to determine the number of Shares subject to any Award of Stock Appreciation Rights.
    (c) **Exercise Price and Other Terms.** The per Share exercise price for the Shares that will determine the amount of the payment to be received upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right as set forth in Section 7(f) will be determined by the Administrator and will be no less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. Otherwise, the Administrator, subject to the provisions of the Plan, will have complete discretion to determine the terms and conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan.
    (d) **Stock Appreciation Right Agreement.** Each Stock Appreciation Right grant will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the exercise price, the term of the Stock Appreciation Right, the conditions of exercise, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
    (e) **Expiration of Stock Appreciation Rights.** A Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan will expire upon the date determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules of Section 6(d) relating

-11-
to the maximum term and Section 6(f) relating to exercise also will apply to Stock Appreciation Rights.
    (f) **Payment of Stock Appreciation Right Amount.** Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, a Participant will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
        (i) The difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price; times
        (ii) The number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised.

At the discretion of the Administrator, the payment upon Stock Appreciation Right exercise may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof.

8. **Restricted Stock.**
    (a) **Grant of Restricted Stock.** Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock to Service Providers in such amounts as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.
    (b) **Restricted Stock Agreement.** Each Award of Restricted Stock will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Period of Restriction, the number of Shares granted, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, the Company as escrow agent will hold Shares of Restricted Stock until the restrictions on such Shares have lapsed.
    (c) **Transferability.** Except as provided in this Section 8 or as the Administrator determines, Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the end of the applicable Period of Restriction.
    (d) **Other Restrictions.** The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may impose such other restrictions on Shares of Restricted Stock as it may deem advisable or appropriate.
    (e) **Removal of Restrictions.** Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8, Shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Restricted Stock grant made under the Plan will be released from escrow as soon as practicable after the last day of the Period of Restriction or at such other time as the Administrator may determine. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed.
    (f) **Voting Rights.** During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the Administrator determines otherwise.
    (g) **Dividends and Other Distributions.** During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such Shares, unless the Administrator provides otherwise. If any

-12-
such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, the Shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid.
    (h) **Return of Restricted Stock to Company.** On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, the Restricted Stock for which restrictions have not lapsed will revert to the Company and again will become available for grant under the Plan.

9. **Restricted Stock Units.**
    (a) **Grant.** Restricted Stock Units may be granted at any time and from time to time as determined by the Administrator. After the Administrator determines that it will grant Restricted Stock Units, it will advise the Participant in an Award Agreement of the terms, conditions, and restrictions related to the grant, including the number of Restricted Stock Units.
    (b) **Vesting Criteria and Other Terms.** The Administrator will set vesting criteria in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which the criteria are met, will determine the number of Restricted Stock Units that will be paid out to the Participant. The Administrator may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment or service), or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.
    (c) **Earning Restricted Stock Units.** Upon meeting the applicable vesting criteria, the Participant will be entitled to receive a payout as determined by the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the grant of Restricted Stock Units, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any vesting criteria that must be met to receive a payout.
    (d) **Form and Timing of Payment.** Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units will be made as soon as practicable after the date(s) determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may settle earned Restricted Stock Units in cash, Shares, or a combination of both.
    (e) **Cancellation.** On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited to the Company.

10. **Compliance With Section 409A.** Awards will be designed and operated in such a manner that they are either exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Section 409A, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. The Plan and each Award Agreement under the Plan is intended to be exempt from or meet the requirements of Section 409A and will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent (including with respect to any ambiguities or ambiguous terms), except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. To the extent that an Award or payment, or the settlement or deferral thereof, is subject to Section 409A the Award will be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will meet the requirements of Section 409A, such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Section 409A. In no event will the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary have any liability or

-13-
obligation to reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless a Participant (or any other person) for any taxes, penalties or interest that may be imposed on, or other costs incurred by, Participant (or any other person) as a result of Section 409A.

11. **Leaves of Absence/Transfer Between Locations.** Unless the Administrator provides otherwise or as otherwise required by Applicable Laws, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence. A Participant will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed three (3) months, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then six (6) months following the first (1st) day of such leave, any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option.

12. **Limited Transferability of Awards.**
    (a) Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, Awards may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (which, for purposes of clarification, shall be deemed to include through a beneficiary designation if available in accordance with Section 6(f)), and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award may only be transferred (i) by will, (ii) by the laws of descent and distribution, or (iii) as permitted by Rule 701 of the Securities Act.
    (b) Further, until the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or after the Administrator determines that it is, will, or may no longer be relying upon the exemption from registration under the Exchange Act as set forth in Rule 12h-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the “Rule 12h-1(f) Exemption”), an Option, or prior to exercise, the Shares subject to the Option, may not be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred or disposed of, in any manner, including by entering into any short position, any “put equivalent position” or any “call equivalent position” (as defined in Rule 16a-1(h) and Rule 16a-1(b) of the Exchange Act, respectively), other than to (i) persons who are “family members” (as defined in Rule 701(c)(3) of the Securities Act) through gifts or domestic relations orders, or (ii) to an executor or guardian of the Participant upon the death or disability of the Participant, in each case, to the extent required for continued reliance on the Rule 12h-1(f) Exemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine to permit transfers to the Company or in connection with a Change in Control or other acquisition transactions involving the Company to the extent permitted by Rule 12h-1(f) or, if the Company is not relying on the Rule 12h-1(f) Exemption, to the extent permitted by the Plan.

13. **Adjustments; Dissolution or Liquidation; Merger or Change in Control.**
    (a) **Adjustments.** In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of

-14-
the Company affecting the Shares occurs, the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, will adjust the number and class of shares of stock that may be delivered under the Plan and/or the number, class, and price of shares of stock covered by each outstanding Award. Further, the Administrator will make such adjustments to an Award as required by Section 25102(o) of the California Corporations Code to the extent the Company is relying upon the exemption afforded thereby with respect to the Award.
    (b) **Dissolution or Liquidation.** In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
    (c) **Merger or Change in Control.** In the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation or other entity or a Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be treated as the Administrator determines (subject to the provisions of the following paragraph) without a Participant’s consent, including, without limitation, that (i) Awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent awards will be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices; (ii) upon written notice to a Participant, that the Participant’s Awards will terminate upon or immediately prior to the consummation of such merger or Change in Control; (iii) outstanding Awards will vest and become exercisable, realizable, or payable, or restrictions applicable to an Award will lapse, in whole or in part prior to or upon consummation of such merger or Change in Control, and, to the extent the Administrator determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the effectiveness of such merger or Change in Control; (iv) (A) the termination of an Award in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant’s rights as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction the Administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant’s rights, then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment), or (B) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion; or (v) any combination of the foregoing. In taking any of the actions permitted under this subsection 13(c), the Administrator will not be obligated to treat all Awards, all Awards held by a Participant, or all Awards of the same type, similarly.

In the event that the successor corporation does not assume or substitute for the Award (or portion thereof), the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units will lapse, and, with respect to Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, in all cases, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable. In addition, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable, if an Option or

-15-
Stock Appreciation Right is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.

For the purposes of this subsection 13(c), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, for each Share subject to such Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control.

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant’s consent, in all cases, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation’s post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13(c) to the contrary, and unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, if an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out under an Award Agreement is subject to Section 409A and if the change in control definition contained in the Award Agreement does not comply with the definition of “change of control” for purposes of a distribution under Section 409A, then any payment of an amount that is otherwise accelerated under this Section will be delayed until the earliest time that such payment would be permissible under Section 409A without triggering any penalties applicable under Section 409A.

14. **Tax Withholding.**
    (a) **Withholding Requirements.** Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company will have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including the Participant’s FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof).
    (b) **Withholding Arrangements.** The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy

-16-
such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part by such methods as the Administrator shall determine, including, without limitation, (i) paying cash, (ii) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares having a fair market value equal to the minimum statutory amount required to be withheld or such greater amount as the Administrator may determine if such amount would not have adverse accounting consequences, as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion, (iii) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a fair market value equal to the statutory amount required to be withheld or such greater amount as the Administrator may determine, in each case, provided the delivery of such Shares will not result in any adverse accounting consequences, as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion, (iv) selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant through such means as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld, (v) such other consideration and method of payment for the meeting of tax withholding obligations as the Administrator may determine to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, or (vi) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed to include any amount which the Administrator agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined or such greater amount as the Administrator may determine if such amount would not have adverse accounting consequences, as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion. The fair market value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld.

15. **No Effect on Employment or Service.** Neither the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant’s relationship as a Service Provider with the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participant’s right or the right of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable, to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

16. **Date of Grant.** The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.

17. **Term of Plan.** Subject to Section 21 of the Plan, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board. Unless sooner terminated under Section 18, it will continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years from the later of (a) the effective date of the Plan, or (b) the earlier of the most recent Board or stockholder approval of an increase in the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan.

18. **Amendment and Termination of the Plan.**
    (a) **Amendment and Termination.** The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.

-17-
    (b) **Stockholder Approval.** The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
    (c) **Effect of Amendment or Termination.** No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator’s ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.

19. **Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.**
    (a) **Legal Compliance.** Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
    (b) **Investment Representations.** As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.

20. **Inability to Obtain Authority.** The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction or to complete or comply with the requirements of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state, federal or foreign law or under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the stock exchange on which Shares of the same class are then listed, or any other governmental or regulatory body, which authority, registration, qualification or rule compliance is deemed by the Company’s counsel to be necessary or advisable for the issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority, registration, qualification or rule compliance will not have been obtained.

21. **Stockholder Approval.** The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.

22. **Information to Participants.** If and as required (i) pursuant to Rule 701 of the Securities Act, if the Company is relying on the exemption from registration provided pursuant to Rule 701 of the Securities Act with respect to the applicable Award, and/or (ii) pursuant to Rule 12h-1(f) of the Exchange Act, to the extent the Company is relying on the Rule 12h-1(f) Exemption, then during the period of reliance on the applicable exemption and in each case of (i) and (ii) until such time as the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall provide to each Participant the information described in paragraphs (e)(3), (4), and (5) of Rule 701 under the Securities Act not less frequently than every six (6) months with the financial statements being not more than 180 days old and with such information

-18-
provided either by physical or electronic delivery to the Participants or by written notice to the Participants of the availability of the information on an Internet site that may be password-protected and of any password needed to access the information. The Company may request that Participants agree to keep the information to be provided pursuant to this section confidential. If a Participant does not agree to keep the information to be provided pursuant to this section confidential, then the Company will not be required to provide the information unless otherwise required pursuant to Rule 12h-1(f)(1) under the Exchange Act (if the Company is relying on the Rule 12h-1(f) Exemption) or Rule 701 of the Securities Act (if the Company is relying on the exemption pursuant to Rule 701 of the Securities Act).

23. **Forfeiture Events.** The Administrator may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant’s rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award will be subject to the reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary under this Plan, an Award shall be subject to the Company’s clawback policy as may be established and/or amended from time to time to comply with Applicable Laws (the “**Clawback Policy**”). The Administrator may require a Participant to forfeit, return or reimburse the Company all or a portion of the Award and any amounts paid thereunder pursuant to the terms of the Clawback Policy or as necessary or appropriate to comply with Applicable Laws.

## INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

This Indemnification Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is dated as of [_______], and is between Synthetica Bio, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “**Company**”), and [insert name of indemnitee] (“**Indemnitee**”).

## RECITALS
A. Indemnitee’s service to the Company substantially benefits the Company.
B. Individuals are reluctant to serve as directors or officers of corporations or in certain other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or indemnification against the risks of claims and actions against them arising out of such service.
C. Indemnitee does not regard the protection currently provided by applicable law, the Company’s governing documents and any insurance as adequate under the present circumstances, and Indemnitee may not be willing to serve as a director or officer without additional protection.
D. In order to induce Indemnitee to continue to provide services to the Company, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company to contractually obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, Indemnitee as permitted by applicable law.
E. This Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the indemnification provided in the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and this Agreement shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor shall this Agreement be deemed to limit, diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder.

The parties therefore agree as follows:

1. **Definitions.**

-2-
        (iii) **Corporate Transactions.** The effective date of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation and with the power to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of such surviving entity;

Pursuant to this Section 2, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his or her behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

-4-
3. **Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company.** The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee’s behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. No indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Section 3 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be liable to the Company, unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or any court in which the Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses as the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

4. **Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful.** To the extent that Indemnitee is a party to or a participant in and is successful (on the merits or otherwise) in defense of any Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee’s behalf in connection therewith.

5. **Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness.** To the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the extent permitted by applicable law against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee’s behalf in connection therewith.

6. **Additional Indemnification.**
    (a) Notwithstanding any limitation in Sections 2, 3 or 4, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding (including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor) against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his or her behalf in connection with the Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein.
    (b) For purposes of Section 6(a), the meaning of the phrase “**to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law**” shall include, but not be limited to:

        (ii) the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors.

7. **Exclusions.** Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnity in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding):

-5-
    (a) for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of Indemnitee under any statute, insurance policy, indemnity provision, vote or otherwise, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid[or with respect to any amounts paid by Secondary Indemnitors] **^1**;
    (b) for an accounting or disgorgement of profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or similar provisions of federal, state or local statutory law or common law, if Indemnitee is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements);
    (c) for any reimbursement of the Company by Indemnitee of any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by Indemnitee from the sale of securities of the Company, in either case as required under any clawback or compensation recovery policy adopted by the Company, applicable securities exchange and association listing requirements, including, without limitation, those adopted in accordance with Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and/or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including, without limitation, any such reimbursements that arise from an accounting restatement of the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “**Sarbanes-Oxley Act**”), or the payment to the Company of profits arising from the purchase and sale by Indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), if Indemnitee is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements);
    (d) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors, officers, employees, agents or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Company’s board of directors authorized the Proceeding (or the relevant part of the Proceeding) prior to its initiation, (ii) the Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law, (iii) otherwise authorized in Section 12(d) or (iv) otherwise required by applicable law; or
    (e) if prohibited by applicable law.

8. **Advances of Expenses.** The Company shall advance the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding prior to its final disposition, and such advancement shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 90 days, after the receipt by the Company of a written statement or statements requesting such advances from time to time (which shall include invoices received by Indemnitee in connection with such Expenses but, in the case of invoices in connection with legal services, any references to legal work performed or to expenditure made that would cause Indemnitee to waive any privilege accorded by applicable law shall not be included with the invoice). Advances shall be unsecured and interest free and made without regard to Indemnitee’s ability to repay such advances. Indemnitee hereby undertakes to repay any advance to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. This Section 8 shall not apply to the extent advancement is prohibited by law and shall not apply to any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) for which indemnity is not permitted under this Agreement, but shall apply to any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) referenced in Section 7(b) or 7(c) prior to a determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.

9. **Procedures for Notification and Defense of Claim.**
    (a) Indemnitee shall notify the Company in writing of any matter with respect to which Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification or advancement of Expenses as soon as reasonably

**^1** Include if Indemnitee is a representative of a fund

-6-
practicable following the receipt by Indemnitee of notice thereof. The written notification to the Company shall include, in reasonable detail, a description of the nature of the Proceeding and the facts underlying the Proceeding. The failure by Indemnitee to notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee hereunder or otherwise than under this Agreement, and any delay in so notifying the Company shall not constitute a waiver by Indemnitee of any rights, except to the extent that such failure or delay materially prejudices the Company.
    (b) If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a Proceeding pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect that may be applicable to the Proceeding, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of the Proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable policies. The Company shall thereafter take all commercially-reasonable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.
    (c) In the event the Company may be obligated to make any indemnity in connection with a Proceeding, the Company shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel approved by Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of its election to do so. After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee for any fees or expenses of counsel subsequently incurred by Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding. Notwithstanding the Company’s assumption of the defense of any such Proceeding, the Company shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of Indemnitee’s separate counsel to the extent (i) the employment of separate counsel by Indemnitee is authorized by the Company, (ii) counsel for the Company or Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there is a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense such that Indemnitee needs to be separately represented, (iii) the Company is not financially or legally able to perform its indemnification obligations or (iv) the Company shall not have retained, or shall not continue to retain, counsel to defend such Proceeding. The Company shall have the right to conduct such defense as it sees fit in its sole discretion. Regardless of any provision in this Agreement, Indemnitee shall have the right to employ counsel in any Proceeding at Indemnitee’s personal expense. The Company shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Company.
    (d) Indemnitee shall give the Company such information and cooperation in connection with the Proceeding as may be reasonably appropriate.
    (e) The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee for any settlement of any Proceeding (or any part thereof) without the Company’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
    (f) The Company shall not settle any Proceeding (or any part thereof) in a manner that imposes any penalty or liability on Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

10. **Procedures upon Application for Indemnification.**
    (a) To obtain indemnification, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and as is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification following the final disposition of the Proceeding. Any delay in providing the request

will not relieve the Company from its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent such failure is prejudicial.
    (b) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a), a determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Company’s board of directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Company’s board of directors, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Company’s board of directors, (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Company’s board of directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) if so directed by the Company’s board of directors, by the stockholders of the Company. If it is determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination. Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information that is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and that is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
    (c) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 10(b), the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 10(c). If a Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Company’s board of directors, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him or her of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Company’s board of directors, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within ten days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of “Independent Counsel” as defined in Section 1 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days after the later of (i) submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof and (ii) the final disposition of the Proceeding, the parties have not agreed upon an Independent Counsel, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other’s selection of Independent Counsel and for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 10(b) hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement, the Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).

    (d) The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of any Independent Counsel.

11. **Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.**
    (a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, and the Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption.
    (b) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of *nolo contendere* or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
    (c) Neither the knowledge, actions nor failure to act of any other director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.

12. **Remedies of Indemnitee.**
    (a) Subject to Section 12(e), in the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 8 or 12(d) of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement within 90 days after the later of the receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification or the final disposition of the Proceeding, (iv) payment of indemnification pursuant to this Agreement is not made (A) within ten days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or (B) with respect to indemnification pursuant to Sections 4, 5 and 12(d) of this Agreement, within 30 days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) the Company or any other person or entity takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, Indemnitee the benefits provided or intended to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of his or her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his or her option, may seek an award in arbitration with respect to his or her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses, to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 12(a); provided, however, that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his or her rights under Section 4 of this Agreement. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee’s right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration in accordance with this Agreement.
    (b) Neither (i) the failure of the Company, its board of directors, any committee or subgroup of the board of directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders to have made a determination that indemnification of Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor (ii) an actual determination by the Company, its board of directors,

-9-
any committee or subgroup of the board of directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that Indemnitee has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12 shall be conducted in all respects as a *de novo* trial, or arbitration, on the merits, and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12, the Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be.
    (c) To the fullest extent not prohibited by law, the Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s statements not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.
    (d) To the extent not prohibited by law, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses that are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action for indemnification or advancement of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company to the extent Indemnitee is successful in such action, and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 90 days, after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor) advance such Expenses to Indemnitee, subject to the provisions of Section 8.
    (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding.

13. **Contribution.** To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amounts incurred by Indemnitee, whether for Expenses, judgments, fines or amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the events and transactions giving rise to such Proceeding; and (ii) the relative fault of Indemnitee and the Company (and its other directors, officers, employees and agents) in connection with such events and transactions.

14. **Non-exclusivity.** The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. To the extent that a change in Delaware law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change, subject to the restrictions

-10-
expressly set forth herein or therein. Except as expressly set forth herein, no right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Except as expressly set forth herein, the assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.

15. [**Primary Responsibility.** The Company acknowledges that Indemnitee has certain rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by [insert name of fund] and certain affiliates thereof (collectively, the “**Secondary Indemnitors**”). The Company agrees that, as between the Company and the Secondary Indemnitors, the Company is primarily responsible for amounts required to be indemnified or advanced under the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or this Agreement and any obligation of the Secondary Indemnitors to provide indemnification or advancement for the same amounts is secondary to those Company obligations. The Company waives any right of contribution or subrogation against the Secondary Indemnitors with respect to the liabilities for which the Company is primarily responsible under this Section 15. In the event of any payment by the Secondary Indemnitors of amounts otherwise required to be indemnified or advanced by the Company under the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or this Agreement, the Secondary Indemnitors shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Indemnitee for indemnification or advancement of expenses under the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or this Agreement or, to the extent such subrogation is unavailable and contribution is found to be the applicable remedy, shall have a right of contribution with respect to the amounts paid; provided, however, that the foregoing sentence will be deemed void if and to the extent that it would violate any applicable insurance policy. The Secondary Indemnitors are express third-party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section 15.] **^2**

16. **No Duplication of Payments.** [Except as provided in Section 15 above,]**^3** The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder (or for which advancement is provided hereunder) if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment for such amounts under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.

17. **Insurance.** To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, trustees, general partners, managing members, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries of the Company or any other Enterprise, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies to the same extent as the most favorably-insured persons under such policy or policies in a comparable position.

18. **Subrogation.** [Except as provided in Section 15 above,]**^4** In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.

**^2** Include if Indemnitee is a representative of a fund.
**^3** Include if Indemnitee is a representative of a fund.
**^4** Include if Indemnitee is a representative of a fund.

-11-
19. **Services to the Company.** Indemnitee agrees to serve as a director or officer of the Company or, at the request of the Company, as a director, trustee, general partner, managing member, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another Enterprise, for so long as Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed or until Indemnitee tenders his or her resignation or is removed from such position. Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law), in which event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue Indemnitee in such position. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise) and Indemnitee. Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that any employment with the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise) is at will, and Indemnitee may be discharged at any time for any reason, with or without cause, with or without notice, except as may be otherwise expressly provided in any executed, written employment contract between Indemnitee and the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise), any existing formal severance policies adopted by the Company’s board of directors or, with respect to service as a director or officer of the Company, the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or the DGCL. No such document shall be subject to any oral modification thereof. Indemnitee acknowledges that Indemnitee serves as an officer of the Company. Indemnitee consents to be identified as an officer of the Company for purposes of Section 3114(b) of the DGCL. Indemnitee acknowledges that (a) Indemnitee is deemed to have consented to the appointment of the registered agent of the Company (or, if there is none, the Delaware Secretary of State) as an agent upon whom service of process may be made in all civil actions or proceedings brought in the State of Delaware, by or on behalf of, or against the Company, in which Indemnitee is a necessary or proper party, or in any action or proceeding against Indemnitee for violation of a duty in Indemnitee’s capacity as an officer of the Company, whether or not Indemnitee continues to serve as an officer at the time suit is commenced; and (b) Indemnitee’s acceptance of appointment, or Indemnitee’s service, as an officer of the Company shall be a signification of Indemnitee’s consent that any process when so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon Indemnitee within the State of Delaware and such appointment of the registered agent of the Company (or, if there is none, the Delaware Secretary of State) shall be irrevocable.

20. **Duration.** This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of (a) ten years after the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a director or officer of the Company or as a director, trustee, general partner, managing member, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other Enterprise, as applicable; or (b) one year after the final termination of any Proceeding, including any appeal, then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement relating thereto.

21. **Successors.** This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns, including any direct or indirect successor, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and Indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators.

22. **Severability.** Nothing in this Agreement is intended to require or shall be construed as requiring the Company to do or fail to do any act in violation of applicable law. The Company’s inability, pursuant to court order or other applicable law, to perform its obligations under this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (ii) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the

-12-
intent of the parties hereto; and (iii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby.

23. **Enforcement.** The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to serve as a director or officer of the Company, and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in serving as a director or officer of the Company.

24. **Entire Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable law.

25. **Modification and Waiver.** No supplement, modification or amendment to this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement shall adversely affect any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his or her Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

26. **Notices.** All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, sent by facsimile or electronic mail or otherwise delivered by hand, messenger or courier service addressed:
    (a) if to Indemnitee, to Indemnitee’s address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as shown on the signature page of this Agreement or in the Company’s records, as may be updated in accordance with the provisions hereof; or
    (b) if to the Company, to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company at 31542 Catalina Ave,, Laguna Beach, CA 92651, or at such other current address as the Company shall have furnished to Indemnitee, with a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to Martin J. Waters, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C., 12235 El Camino Real, Suite 200, San Diego, CA 92130-3002.

Each such notice or other communication shall for all purposes of this Agreement be treated as effective or having been given (i) if delivered by hand, messenger or courier service, when delivered (or if sent via a nationally-recognized overnight courier service, freight prepaid, specifying next-business-day delivery, one business day after deposit with the courier), (ii) if sent via mail, at the earlier of its receipt or five days after the same has been deposited in a regularly-maintained receptacle for the deposit of the United States mail, addressed and mailed as aforesaid, or (iii) if sent via facsimile, upon confirmation of facsimile transfer or, if sent via electronic mail, upon confirmation of delivery when directed to the relevant electronic mail address, if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, or if not sent during normal business hours of the recipient, then on the recipient’s next business day.

27. **Applicable Law and Consent to Jurisdiction.** This Agreement and the legal relations among the parties shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Except with respect to any arbitration commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement, the Company and Indemnitee

-13-
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought only in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and not in any other state or federal court in the United States of America or any court in any other country, (ii) consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery for purposes of any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, (iii) appoint, to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, The Corporation Trust Company, Wilmington, Delaware as its agent in the State of Delaware as such party’s agent for acceptance of legal process in connection with any such action or proceeding against such party with the same legal force and validity as if served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware, (iv) waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (v) waive, and agree not to plead or to make, any claim that any such action or proceeding brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery has been brought in an improper or inconvenient forum.

28. **Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. This Agreement may also be executed and delivered by facsimile signature and in counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Only one such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforceability is sought needs to be produced to evidence the existence of this Agreement.

THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED EXCEPT AS PERMITTED IN THIS SAFE AND UNDER THE ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM.

(Simple Agreement for Future Equity)

THIS CERTIFIES THAT in exchange for the payment by [_____________] (the “**Investor**”) of $[______] (the “**Purchase Amount**”) on or about [_______], 2023, Synthetica Bio, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “**Company**”), issues to the Investor the right to certain shares of the Company’s Capital Stock, subject to the terms described below.

The “**Post-Money Valuation Cap**” is $15,000,000.

The “**Discount Rate**” is 85%.

See Section 2 for certain additional defined terms.

1. **Events**
    (a) **Equity Financing.** If there is an Equity Financing before the termination of this Safe, on the initial closing of such Equity Financing, this Safe will automatically convert into the number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Conversion Price.

In connection with the automatic conversion of this Safe into shares of Safe Preferred Stock, the Investor will execute and deliver to the Company all of the transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; provided, that such documents (i) are the same documents to be entered into with the purchasers of Standard Preferred Stock, with appropriate variations for the Safe Preferred Stock if applicable, and (ii) have customary exceptions to any drag-along applicable to the Investor, including (without limitation) limited representations, warranties, liability and indemnification obligations for the Investor.

    (b) **Liquidity Event.** If there is a Liquidity Event before the termination of this Safe, this Safe will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of such Liquidity Event, equal to the greater of (i) the Purchase Amount (the “**Cash-Out Amount**”) or (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price (the “**Conversion Amount**”). If any of the Company’s securityholders are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be received in a Liquidity Event, the Investor will be given the same choice, provided that the Investor may not choose to receive a form of consideration that the Investor would be ineligible to receive as a result of the Investor’s failure to satisfy any requirement or limitation generally applicable to the Company’s securityholders, or under any applicable laws.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with a Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, the Company may reduce the cash portion of Proceeds payable to the Investor by the amount determined by its board of directors in good faith for such Change of Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that such reduction (A) does not reduce the total Proceeds payable to such Investor and (B) is applied in the same manner and on a pro rata basis to all securityholders who have equal priority to the Investor under Section 1(d).

    (c) **Dissolution Event.** If there is a Dissolution Event before the termination of this Safe, the Investor will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds equal to the Cash-Out Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event.

## POST-MONEY VALUATION CAP WITH DISCOUNT

    (d) **Liquidation Priority.** In a Liquidity Event or Dissolution Event, this Safe is intended to operate like standard non-participating Preferred Stock. The Investor’s right to receive its Cash-Out Amount is:
        (i) Junior to payment of outstanding indebtedness and creditor claims, including contractual claims for payment and convertible promissory notes (to the extent such convertible promissory notes are not actually or notionally converted into Capital Stock);
        (ii) On par with payments for other Safes and/or Preferred Stock, and if the applicable Proceeds are insufficient to permit full payments to the Investor and such other Safes and/or Preferred Stock, the applicable Proceeds will be distributed pro rata to the Investor and such other Safes and/or Preferred Stock in proportion to the full payments that would otherwise be due; and
        (iii) Senior to payments for Common Stock.

The Investor’s right to receive its Conversion Amount is (A) on par with payments for Common Stock and other Safes and/or Preferred Stock who are also receiving Conversion Amounts or Proceeds on a similar as-converted to Common Stock basis, and (B) junior to payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) above (in the latter case, to the extent such payments are Cash-Out Amounts or similar liquidation preferences).

4. **Investor Representations**
    (a) The Investor has full legal capacity, power and authority to execute and deliver this Safe and to perform its obligations hereunder. This Safe constitutes valid and binding obligation of the Investor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity.
    (b) The Investor is an accredited investor as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and acknowledges and agrees that if not an accredited investor at the time of an Equity Financing, the Company may void this Safe and return the Purchase Amount. The Investor has been advised that this Safe and the underlying securities have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws and, therefore, cannot be resold unless they are registered under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or unless an exemption from such registration requirements is available. The Investor is purchasing this Safe and the securities to be acquired by the Investor hereunder for its own account for investment, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof, and the Investor has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. The Investor has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the Investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such investment, is able to incur a complete loss of such investment without impairing the Investor’s financial condition and is able to bear the economic risk of such investment for an indefinite period of time.

    (a) Any provision of this Safe may be amended, waived or modified by written consent of the Company and either (i) the Investor or (ii) the majority-in-interest of all the then outstanding Safes with the same “Post-Money Valuation Cap” and “Discount Rate” as this Safe (and Safes lacking one or both of such terms will be considered to be the same with respect to such term(s)), provided that with respect to clause (ii): (A) the Purchase Amount may not be amended, waived or modified in this manner, (B) the consent of the Investor and each holder of such Safes must be solicited (even if not obtained), and (C) such amendment, waiver or modification treats all such holders in the same manner. “Majority-in-interest” refers to the holders of the applicable group of Safes whose Safes have a total Purchase Amount greater than 50% of the total Purchase Amount of all such applicable group of Safes.
    (b) Any notice required or permitted by this Safe will be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight courier or sent by email to the relevant address listed on the signature page, or 48 hours after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such party’s address listed on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice.
    (c) The Investor is not entitled, as a holder of this Safe, to vote or be deemed a holder of Capital Stock for any purpose other than tax purposes, nor will anything in this Safe be construed to confer on the Investor, as such, any rights of a Company stockholder or rights to vote for the election of directors or on any matter submitted to Company stockholders, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action or to receive notice of meetings, until shares have been issued on the terms described in Section 1. However, if the Company pays a dividend on outstanding shares of Common Stock (that is not payable in shares of Common Stock) while this Safe is outstanding, the Company will pay the Dividend Amount to the Investor at the same time.
    (d) Neither this Safe nor the rights in this Safe are transferable or assignable, by operation of law or otherwise, by either party without the prior written consent of the other; provided, however, that this Safe and/or its rights may be assigned without the Company’s consent by the Investor (i) to the Investor’s estate, heirs, executors, administrators, guardians and/or successors in the event of Investor’s death or disability, or (ii) to any other entity who directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Investor, including, without limitation, any general partner, managing member, officer or director of the Investor, or any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing which is controlled by one or more general partners or managing members of, or shares the same management company with, the Investor; and provided, further, that the Company may assign this Safe in whole, without the consent of the Investor, in connection with a reincorporation to change the Company’s domicile.

    (e) In the event any one or more of the provisions of this Safe is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part or in any respect, or in the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Safe operate or would prospectively operate to invalidate this Safe, then and in any such event, such provision(s) only will be deemed null and void and will not affect any other provision of this Safe and the remaining provisions of this Safe will remain operative and in full force and effect and will be affected, prejudiced, or disturbed thereby.
    (f) All rights and obligations hereunder will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions of such jurisdiction.
    (g) The parties acknowledge and agree that for United States federal and state income tax purposes this Safe is, and at all times has been, intended to be characterized as stock, and more particularly as common stock for purposes of Sections 304, 305, 306, 354, 368, 1036 and 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

In connection with and to induce the investment by Virtue Ventures Fund I LP (the “Investor”) in Synthetica Bio, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), pursuant to the terms of that certain simple agreement for future equity dated on or about the date hereof (the “Investor Safe”), the Company and the Investor hereby covenant and agree as follows.

The Company will not, without the consent of the Investor, offer or sell in excess of $3,000,000 in Safes on substantially the same economic terms as the Investor Safe (the forgoing, collectively, the “Initial Safes”) (for the avoidance of doubt, such amount includes the Purchase Amount of the Investor Safe).

3. **Pro Rata Rights.** The Investor shall have the right to purchase its pro rata share of any Subsequent Convertible Securities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any side letter or other agreements accompanying such securities) (the “Pro Rata Right”). Pro rata share for purposes of this Pro Rata Right is the ratio of (x) the Purchase Amount under the Investor Safe (and other Safes held by the Investor) to (y) the aggregate investment received by the Company for all Safes or other Convertible Securities issued by the Company prior to the issuance of such Subsequent Convertible Securities.

“**Convertible Securities**” means convertible securities that the Company may issue with the principal purpose of raising capital, including but not limited to, other Safes, convertible debt instruments and other convertible securities. Convertible Securities excludes: (i) options issued pursuant to any equity incentive or similar plan of the Company; (ii) convertible securities issued or issuable to (A) banks, equipment lessors, financial institutions or other persons engaged in the business of making loans pursuant to a debt financing or commercial leasing or (B) suppliers or third party service providers in connection

4. **Major Investor Rights.** Following conversion of the Investor SAFE in connection with the Equity Financing, the Company shall provide that Investor is, and shall have all the rights identical to, a “major investor” or “major purchaser,” as such term or a similar term may be defined in the transaction documents governing the Equity Financing.

5. “**MFN**” **Amendment Provision.** If the Company issues any Convertible Securities (as defined below) with terms more favorable than those of the Investor Safe prior to termination of the Investor Safe, the Company will promptly provide the Investor with written notice thereof, together with a copy of such Convertible Securities (the “MFN Notice”) and, upon written request of the Investor, any additional information related to such Convertible Securities as may be reasonably requested by the Investor. In the event the Investor determines that the terms of the Convertible Securities are preferable to the terms of the Investor Safe, the Investor will notify the Company in writing within 10 days of the receipt of the MFN Notice. Promptly after receipt of such written notice from the Investor, the Company agrees to amend the Investor Safe or this letter agreement to include such preferable terms.

6. **Amendments to Investor Safe.** Notwithstanding the terms of Section 6(a) of the Investor Safe, the Investor Safe may not be amended or any provision waived or modified without the written consent of the Investor.

7. **Confidentiality.** The Investor agrees that it (i) will keep confidential, (ii) will not disclose or divulge, or use for any purpose (other than to monitor or make decisions with respect to its investment in the Company), and (iii) will protect to the same degree as it protects its own confidential information any confidential information obtained from the Company pursuant to the terms of this letter agreement, unless such confidential information (a) is known or becomes known to the public in general (other than as a result of a breach of this paragraph by the Investor), (b) is or has been independently developed or conceived by the Investor without use of the Company’s confidential information, or (c) is or has been made known or disclosed to the Investor by a third party without a breach of any obligation of confidentiality such third party may have to the Company; provided, however, that the Investor may disclose confidential information (X) to its attorneys, accountants, consultants, and other professionals to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain their services in connection with monitoring its investment in the Company; (Y) to any existing or prospective affiliate, partner, member, stockholder, or wholly owned subsidiary of the Investor in the ordinary course of business, provided that the Investor informs such person that such information is confidential and directs such person to maintain the confidentiality of such information; or (iii) as may otherwise be required by law, regulation, rule, court order or subpoena, provided that the Investor promptly notifies the Company of such disclosure and takes reasonable steps to minimize the extent of any such required disclosure (each person contemplated by clause (X) or (Y), a “Permitted Disclosee”). The Investor shall be fully responsible for any use or disclosure of the confidential information by its Permitted Disclosees as if such Permitted Disclosees were the Investor. Furthermore, the Investor agrees that any confidential information provided to or learned by it in connection with its rights under this letter agreement shall be further subject to confidentiality provisions set forth in any future Investors’ Rights Agreement entered into between the Company, the Investor and other investors in connection with an Equity Financing.

3
8. **Fees and Expenses.** Promptly following receipt of a summary invoice, the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel for the Investor in an amount not to exceed, in the aggregate, $15,000.

10. **Miscellaneous.** Unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of this letter agreement, the rights described herein shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earliest to occur of (i) the closing of the Equity Financing, (ii) such time as neither the Investor Safe nor other securities or instruments convertible into securities of the Company is held by the Investor or its affiliates; or (iii) the consummation of a Liquidity Event or Dissolution Event that is effected (a) for independent business reasons unrelated to extinguishing such rights; and (b) for purposes other than (X) the reincorporation of the Company in a different state; or (Y) the formation of a holding company that will be owned exclusively by the Company’s stockholders and will hold all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company’s successor. The confidentiality obligations referenced herein will survive any such termination. This letter agreement may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified without the written consent of both the Company and the Investor. This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware as applied to agreements among Delaware residents entered into and to be performed entirely within Delaware. This letter agreement may be executed in electronic form and in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

# RIGHTS AGREEMENT

This agreement (this “**Agreement**”) is entered into on or about June 23, 2023 in connection with the purchase by AIX VENTURES LP (the “**Investor**”) of that certain simple agreement for future equity with a “Post-Money Valuation Cap” (the “**Investor’s Safe**”) issued by Synthetica Bio, Inc. (the “**Company**”) on or about the date of this Agreement. As a material inducement to the Investor’s investment, the Company agrees to the provisions set forth in this Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Investor’s Safe.

1. **Pro Rata Rights.**
    a. The Investor shall have the right to purchase its pro rata share of Standard Preferred Stock being sold in the Equity Financing (the “**Pro Rata Right**”). Pro rata share for purposes of this Pro Rata Right is the ratio of (x) the number of shares of Capital Stock issued from the conversion of all of the Investor’s Safes with a “Post-Money Valuation Cap” plus the Investor’s outstanding shares of the Company (if any) to (y) the Company Capitalization immediately prior to the Equity Financing.
    b. After the Equity Financing and for so long as the Investor holds at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the shares of the Company’s capital stock that is issued upon conversion of the Investor’s Safe (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like), notwithstanding any threshold ownership requirement set forth in the Equity Financing agreements, the Company and the Investor hereby agree and acknowledge that the Investor shall be deemed a “Major Investor” (or such similar term) as defined in such Equity Financing and any subsequent financing, exclusively for purposes of the pro rata rights (for securities issuances occurring after the Equity Financing) and information rights, subject to the same conditions and limitations that apply to “Major Investors” thereunder. To the extent any of the pro rata rights provided to “Major Investors” are waived, modified or amended pursuant to the terms of the Equity Financing agreements, such pro rata rights shall also be considered to have been waived, modified or amended to the same extent under this Agreement.

2. **Inspection and Information Rights.**
    a. The Company shall permit the Investor, at the Investor’s expense, and on the Investor’s written request, to visit and inspect the Company’s properties; examine its books of account and records; and discuss the Company’s affairs, finances, and accounts with its officers, during normal business hours of the Company as may be reasonably requested by the Investor; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to provide (a) access to any information that it reasonably and in good faith considers to be confidential information (unless covered by an enforceable confidentiality agreement, in form reasonably acceptable to the Company), a trade secret or the disclosure of which would adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel or (b) access to any information if the Board has reasonably determined the Investor is a Competitor (as defined in the Rights Agreement) of the Company.
    b. The Company shall deliver to the Investor: (a) as soon as practicable, but in any event within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company (i) a balance sheet as of the end of such year, (ii) statements of income and of cash flows for such year, and (iii) a statement of stockholders’ equity as of the end of such year, (b) as soon as practicable, but in any event within forty-five (45) days after the end of each of the first three (3) quarters of each fiscal year of the Company, unaudited statements of

1
income and cash flows for such fiscal quarter, and an unaudited balance sheet and a statement of stockholders’ equity as of the end of such fiscal quarter, all prepared in accordance with GAAP (except that such financial statements may (i) be subject to normal year-end audit adjustments; and (ii) not contain all notes thereto that may be required in accordance with GAAP), and (c) as soon as practicable, but in any event within fifteen (15) days after the end of each quarter, shall deliver an up-to-date summary capitalization table with detail sufficient to show the Investor’s fully-diluted ownership in the Company.

3. **MFN Amendment Provision.** If the Company issues any Subsequent Convertible Securities (as defined below), with terms more favorable than those of the Investor’s Safe (including, without limitation, a valuation cap and/or discount) prior to termination of the Investor’s Safe, the Company will promptly provide the Investor with written notice thereof, together with a copy of such Subsequent Convertible Securities (the “MFN Notice”) and, upon written request of the Investor, any additional information related to such Subsequent Convertible Securities as may be reasonably requested by the Investor. In the event the Investor determines that the terms of the Subsequent Convertible Securities are preferable to the terms of this instrument, the Investor will notify the Company in writing within ten (10) days of the receipt of the MFN Notice. Promptly after receipt of such written notice from the Investor, the Company agrees to amend and restate the Investor’s Safe to be identical to the instrument(s) evidencing the Subsequent Convertible Securities. “**Subsequent Convertible Securities**” means convertible securities that the Company may issue after the issuance of this instrument with the principal purpose of raising capital, including but not limited to, other Safes, convertible debt instruments and other convertible securities. Subsequent Convertible Securities excludes: (i) options issued pursuant to any equity incentive or similar plan of the Company; (ii) convertible securities issued or issuable to (A) banks, equipment lessors, financial institutions or other persons engaged in the business of making loans pursuant to a debt financing or commercial leasing or (B) suppliers or third party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions; and (iii) convertible securities issued or issuable in connection with sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other similar agreements or strategic partnerships.

Neither this Agreement nor the rights contained herein may be assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, by Investor without the prior written consent of the Company; provided, however, that this Agreement and/or the rights contained herein may be assigned without the Company’s consent by the Investor to any other entity who directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Investor, including, without limitation, any general partner, managing member, officer or director of the Investor, or any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing which is controlled by one or more general partners or managing members of, or shares the same management company with, the Investor.

Any provision of this Agreement may be amended, waived or modified upon the written consent of the Company and the Investor. The choice of law governing any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be consistent with that set forth in the Investor’s Safe.

Investor agrees to keep confidential and not disclose, divulge, or use for any purpose (other than to monitor its investment in the Company) any confidential information obtained from the Company unless such confidential information (a) is known or becomes known to the public in general (other than as a result of a breach of the terms of this paragraph by the Investor), (b) is or has been independently developed or conceived by the Investor without use of the Company’s confidential information (as evidenced by contemporaneous written materials), or (c) is or has been made known or disclosed to the Investor by a third party without a breach of any obligation of confidentiality such third party may have to the Company; provided, however, that an Investor may disclose confidential information (i) to its attorneys, accountants, consultants, and other professionals to the extent necessary to obtain their services

2
in connection with monitoring its investment in the Company, (ii) to any prospective purchaser of any Registrable Securities (as defined in the Rights Agreement) from the Investor, if such prospective purchaser agrees to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph; (iii) to any existing or prospective Affiliate (as defined in the Rights Agreement), partner, member, stockholder, wholly-owned subsidiary, executive officer or director of the Investor in the ordinary course of business, provided that the Investor informs such Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) that such information is confidential and directs such Person to maintain the confidentiality of such information, or (iv) as may otherwise be required by law, regulation, rule, court order or subpoena, provided that the Investor promptly notifies the Company of such disclosure and takes reasonable steps to minimize the extent of any such required disclosure.

The rights described herein shall automatically terminate upon the earliest of: (i) immediately prior to the closing of a Liquidity Event; or (iii) immediately prior to a Dissolution Event.

Re: Letter Agreement Regarding Certain Rights of Page One Ventures

Dear Page One Ventures:

In connection with and to induce the investment by Page One Ventures, L.P. (the “Investor”) in Synthetica Bio, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), pursuant to the terms of that certain simple agreement for future equity dated on or about the date hereof (the “Investor Safe”), the Company and the Investor hereby covenant and agree as follows. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Investor Safe.

1. **Pro Rata Rights.** The Investor shall have the right to purchase its pro rata share of any Subsequent Convertible Securities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any side letter or other agreements accompanying such securities) (the “Pro Rata Right”). Pro rata share for purposes of this Pro Rata Right is the ratio of (x) the Purchase Amount under the Investor Safe (and other Safes held by the Investor) to (y) the aggregate investment received by the Company for all Safes or other Convertible Securities issued by the Company prior to the issuance of such Subsequent Convertible Securities.

“**Convertible Securities**” means convertible securities that the Company may issue with the principal purpose of raising capital, including but not limited to, other Safes, convertible debt instruments and other convertible securities. Convertible Securities excludes: (i) options issued pursuant to any equity incentive or similar plan of the Company; (ii) convertible securities issued or issuable to (A) banks, equipment lessors, financial institutions or other persons engaged in the business of making loans pursuant to a debt financing or commercial leasing or (B) suppliers or third party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions; and (iii) convertible securities issued or issuable in connection with sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other similar agreements or strategic partnerships.

“**Subsequent Convertible Securities**” means Convertible Securities that the Company may issue (excluding the Safes currently approved by the Board) and shall be deemed to include any side letter or other agreements accompanying such securities.

2. “**MFN**” **Amendment Provision.** If the Company issues any Convertible Securities (as defined below) with terms more favorable than those of the Investor Safe prior to termination of the Investor Safe, the Company will promptly provide the Investor with written notice thereof, together with a copy of such Convertible Securities (the “MFN Notice”) and, upon written request of the Investor, any additional information related to such Convertible Securities as may be reasonably requested by the Investor. In the event the Investor determines that the terms of the Convertible Securities are preferable to the terms of the Investor Safe, the Investor will notify the Company in writing within 10 days of the receipt of the MFN Notice. Promptly after receipt of such written notice from the Investor, the Company agrees to amend the Investor Safe or this letter agreement to include such preferable terms.

3. **Confidentiality.** The Investor agrees that it (i) will keep confidential, (ii) will not disclose or divulge, or use for any purpose (other than to monitor or make decisions with respect to its investment in the Company), and (iii) will protect to the same degree as it protects its own confidential information any

2
confidential information obtained from the Company pursuant to the terms of this letter agreement, unless such confidential information (a) is known or becomes known to the public in general (other than as a result of a breach of this paragraph by the Investor), (b) is or has been independently developed or conceived by the Investor without use of the Company’s confidential information, or (c) is or has been made known or disclosed to the Investor by a third party without a breach of any obligation of confidentiality such third party may have to the Company; provided, however, that the Investor may disclose confidential information (X) to its attorneys, accountants, consultants, and other professionals to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain their services in connection with monitoring its investment in the Company; (Y) to any existing or prospective affiliate, partner, member, stockholder, or wholly owned subsidiary of the Investor in the ordinary course of business, provided that the Investor informs such person that such information is confidential and directs such person to maintain the confidentiality of such information; or (iii) as may otherwise be required by law, regulation, rule, court order or subpoena, provided that the Investor promptly notifies the Company of such disclosure and takes reasonable steps to minimize the extent of any such required disclosure (each person contemplated by clause (X) or (Y), a “Permitted Disclosee”). The Investor shall be fully responsible for any use or disclosure of the confidential information by its Permitted Disclosees as if such Permitted Disclosees were the Investor. Furthermore, the Investor agrees that any confidential information provided to or learned by it in connection with its rights under this letter agreement shall be further subject to confidentiality provisions set forth in any future Investors’ Rights Agreement entered into between the Company, the Investor and other investors in connection with an Equity Financing.

4. **Right to Conduct Activities.** The Company hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Investor (together with its affiliates) is a professional investment organization, and as such reviews the business plans and related proprietary information of many enterprises. The Company hereby agrees that, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the Investor (and its affiliates) shall not be liable to the Company for any claim arising out of, or based upon, (i) the investment by the Investor (or its affiliates) in any entity competitive with the Company, or (ii) actions taken by any partner, officer, employee or other representative of the Investor (or its affiliates) to assist any such competitive company, whether or not such action was taken as a member of the board of directors of such competitive company or otherwise, and whether or not such action has a detrimental effect on the Company; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not relieve the Investor from liability associated with the unauthorized disclosure of the Company’s confidential information obtained pursuant to this letter agreement.

5. **Miscellaneous.** Unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of this letter agreement, the rights described herein shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earliest to occur of (i) the closing of the Equity Financing, (ii) such time as neither the Investor Safe nor other securities or instruments convertible into securities of the Company is held by the Investor or its affiliates; or (iii) the consummation of a Liquidity Event or Dissolution Event that is effected (a) for independent business reasons unrelated to extinguishing such rights; and (b) for purposes other than (X) the reincorporation of the Company in a different state; or (Y) the formation of a holding company that will be owned exclusively by the Company’s stockholders and will hold all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company’s successor. The confidentiality obligations referenced herein will survive any such termination. This letter agreement may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified without the written consent of both the Company and the Investor. This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware as applied to agreements among Delaware residents entered into and to be performed entirely within Delaware. This letter agreement may be executed in electronic form and in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

6. **Termination of Prior Letter Agreement.** Upon the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Letter Agreement, that certain prior letter agreement by and between the Company and the Investor, dated July 25, 2023, shall be deemed amended and restated and superseded and replaced in its entirety by this Amended and Restated Letter Agreement, and shall be of no further force or effect.
