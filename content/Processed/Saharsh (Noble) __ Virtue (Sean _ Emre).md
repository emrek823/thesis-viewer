### Noble Forum Overview

- Average member has 10+ years of P&L ownership
- High quality physicians seeking place to channel energy
- February inaugural event targeting physician P&L owners
	- Themes: automation, value-based care, future of health systems
	- Focus on creating more physician CEOs and boardroom presence
- Membership model showing strong demand and growth

### Fund Strategy Development

- Fund idea emerged 6 months ago from venture investors in Noble
- Past 6 weeks: significant momentum building
- Positioned as different product for physician executives:
	- Noble: mid-career physicians with 10-20 years ahead
	- Patient capital: high net worth folks (e.g., former CMO of California Blue)
- Microsoft exec developing course on physician prompt engineering
- 12-60 month horizon: unicorn physicians building business models of tomorrow

### Fund Structure & Approach

- Target size: $15M (some pushback suggesting $20-25M for institutional interest)
- Check sizes: $250-500K maximum
- Stage agnostic approach recommended over early-stage only focus
- Non-leading strategy to cooperate with existing ecosystem
- Solo GP structure preferred over SPV model for speed

### Key Strategic Advice from Sean

- Avoid institutional LP route - extremely difficult fundraising environment
- Focus on physician/family office LP base already showing interest
- Don’t limit to early stages - best deals matter regardless of round
- Priority: access to best possible deals, not ownership optimization
- Association with marquee firms (Thrive, Sequoia) crucial for credibility
- Fund admin: Adura Advisors, Legal: Morrison & Forster

### Fundraising Progress & Next Steps

- Current commitments: ~1/3 of $15M target from physician network
- Family offices with healthcare backgrounds identified as key channel
- Recommended connections: NBX team, Caravan Health (Texas physician network)
- Speed critical - avoid 12+ month fundraising cycles that kill momentum
- First close possible at 50% target ($7.5M) to begin investing
