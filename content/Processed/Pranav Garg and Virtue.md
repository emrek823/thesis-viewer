### Company Background & Team

- Pranav Garg background
	- VC experience in healthcare software, specifically radiology AI
	- Operator experience at MB Clarity (healthcare software, PE-backed MSO focus)
	- Recent AI agent company operations lead in Bay Area
- Rohan background
	- McKinsey consulting (payers + providers)
	- Vuma AI logistics startup (deployment function, human-in-loop)
	- Met Pranav 5 months ago, exploring healthcare AI opportunities

### SNF Market Problem & Solution

- Core allocation issue during “silver tsunami”
	- SNF admission acuity rising significantly
	- Facilities rejecting higher-acuity patients despite higher reimbursement rates
	- Root cause: not capturing full revenue due to MDS coding gaps
- Current MDS coding approaches both flawed
	- In-house nurse: high quality but removes nurse from patient care
	- Virtual MDS nurses: cheaper/more experienced but lack clinical context
- Technology stack antiquated
	- Point Click Care virtual monopoly with poor UX (1000-page help manual)
	- Nurses spend 1/12 of daily hours on utilization management documentation
- Market opportunity: $20B profit pool expansion if 10-20% revenue increase achieved per MDS patient

### Business Model & Expansion Paths

- Immediate focus: MDS coding optimization with clinical rule-set development
- Expansion opportunities identified
- Defensibility through proprietary clinical rule-set
	- Capturing accept/reject data on MDS recommendations
	- Building observational knowledge not available off-shelf
- Fundraising timeline: late spring/early summer 2026
	- Milestones: finalize CTO hire, secure commercial validation pilot
	- Target: pilot converting to paid contract plus pipeline
