### PR Strategy Overview

- Target announcement: January 28th, leveraging post-JPMorgan quiet period
- Working with Command PR firm to secure exclusive coverage
- Bundle seed + Series A announcement with company launch
- Focus on brand credibility over direct audience reach
	- Want Gyde logo alongside Wall Street Journal, Axios, TechCrunch
	- Need shareable third-party validation for broker sales conversations
	- Establish category leadership positioning

### Target Outlets & Approach

- Traditional tier-1 business outlets
	- Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, Axios prioritized
	- Command has strong reporter relationships for pitching
- Venture/tech coverage for recruiting purposes
- Podcast appearances planned
	- TVPN, Sorcery for venture audience (15-30 min commitments)
	- Self-funded Broker podcast (generated most leads previously)
	- Lightspeed Investment Memo as follow-up content
- Owned channels launching: blog, LinkedIn (employee benefits), Facebook (Medicare), Instagram

### Audience Considerations

- Primary: Agency principals for go-to-market credibility
- Secondary: Engineers/technologists for recruiting
- Broker community responds to different credibility signals
	- Steve Young board position carries more weight than VC names
	- Endowment fund investors (like Vanderbilt) resonate over venture brands
	- Need to avoid detailed economics/multiples discussion in public forums
- Story angle: AI-enabled comprehensive guide positioning brokers as healthcare value chain leaders

### Next Steps

- Draft press release by December 30th for investor review
- Pitching begins early January
- Media package with assets/copy for investor amplification
- Continue dialogue on potential media introductions
