## UNH 2Q25 Follow Up: A Resetting of Process, Financials and Tone

The most noticeable takeaway from UnitedHealth's earnings report was the totality of the resetting process. The company reset the way it manages the company, the individuals in charge of many of the business segments, the culture and mission driven attitude, the tone from which communications with all stakeholders will start with transparency, and obviously its financial metrics and targets.

Starting with tone, we are seeing a much more transparent delivery of information for an enterprise that was known for simplifying disclosures over a long period of time. There were times when we had segment level MLRs, more granular views of operating income, and SEC disclosures around certain lines of business. While we may never get back to those days, we do note that UnitedHealth was more forthcoming with information in both the press release and the earnings call. The directive seems to be clearly coming from the top with CEO Hemsly getting only 2 minutes into his prepared remarks before highlighting a "tone we are setting at this enterprise." Later in the Q&A, Hemsley pushed for additional granularity to a question around one time costs, something that struck us as unlike previous calls. When times are more difficult, transparency is typically a necessity.

We also noted a resetting of management roles and process despite Hemsley taking the CEO role just over 2 months ago. While there were a few executives that remain secured in their roles such as CFO Rex and Chief Strategy Office Schumacher (definitely still there), others have been promoted to new roles in the past year, and some even made their inaugural appearances on the earnings call. One interesting item to note is that all of those in new elevated positions are internal promotions (perhaps the exception being Dhivya Suryadevara, CEO OptumInsight, who joined in the past two years). We have long heard about UnitedHealth's deep bench, which appears to be a critical asset in the current period. Perhaps most importantly was the discussion around management process, which includes monthly financial reviews. Former employees reminisce about the rigor of these meetings that started under Hemsley and continued under Wichmann. Apparently these devolved under Witty, but are clearly back. We believe this speaks to accountability but also to teamwork, internal transparency and the need to work at the enterprise level.

Overall, UnitedHealth is far from delivering financial results that were reported even last year. In fact, we don't think the previous LT EPS target of 13-16% is relevant at this point. The market became accustomed to consistent execution over decades and financial results that supported premium valuations. In the note below, we start with an analysis of earnings power and review various other updates. We see a path to returning to that level of consistency, but we believe success rests in execution.

Our target of $293 per share is based on 17.5x our 2026 EPS estimate of $16.75.

## Actions
With the results of the quarter, we are reducing our estimates for 2025 and 2026 EPS, as well as our price target. Our 2025 adjusted EPS estimate moves to $16.00 per share, which now represents a decline of 42% YOY off of 2024 which will be the first decline in EPS for UnitedHealth since 2008 and the largest we can find. Next, our 2026 EPS estimate moves to $16.75 per share, which now implies growth of 5% YOY signaling our belief that there is a lot more investment to come. Lastly, our price target moves to $293, which is based on 17.5x our 2026 EPS estimate.

## Earnings Power
The value of UNH shares now moves from a simple P/E multiple applied to current earnings and more to one based on earnings potential. The most important thing to keep in mind with theoretical earnings power is that the targets need to be reasonable and achievable, AND there must be confidence in the leadership team to execute and deliver on those targets.

**Revenues**: We are now forecasting total 2025 revenues of $446.8B, the midpoint of updated guidance. Going forward we have what we believe to be modest assumptions trending forward. After a very small contraction overall in 2026 (Mostly UHC and OptumHealth), we then revert to what we think are reasonable medium term growth rates. Our blended assumptions call for 5.8% growth in 2027 and 2028. As a reminder, UnitedHealth has grown its top line at a CAGR of 11.9% over the past 10 years, and closer to 12.6% over the past 20. We think those days are behind the company, especially without additional M&A, but we assume that the top line overall is reasonably in the mid-single-digits in light of healthcare industry growth.

**Operating Earnings**: For this exercise we are focusing on target margins within the segments by 2028. We use our current estimates for 2025 and 2026 and then assume UnitedHealth achieves half of the progress to target margins in each of the following two years. For OptumHealth, we anchor on the midpoint of the company's new LT target margins of 6-8%. For OptumInsight, we simply maintain 20% margins going forward which would be in line with previous long term targets of 18-22%, though it is unclear if that is still the target. We would note that this implies just 100bps of margin improvement in a three year period. For OptumRx we stick with the midpoint of previous guidance as well, which was 3-5%. Lastly, our UnitedHealthcare segment margin target arrives at 5% which is a blend of underlying segments (MA the largest segment at 2-4% target margins). We note that our UHC target margin of 5% would be below results as recently as 2024.

**EPS and Valuation**: As the chart shows, we are currently estimating $16.00 per share in 2025 and $16.75 per share in 2026. Based on the target margins and revenue assumptions, we estimate earnings power of ~$24 in 2027 and ~$32 in 2028. Shares closed today at $261, or approximately 8x the 2028 earnings power estimate. While we believe that these assumptions err on the side of conservatism with regard to long term growth rates and target margins, we again emphasize that execution is the key.

## Observations
1) Starting with MLR, the company reported a 2Q25 MLR of 89.40%, which was 74bps higher than our estimate of 88.65% and roughly 20bps above the consensus of 89.2%. On a year-over-year basis, the 2Q25 MLR was up 427bps (or 419bps adjusting for PPRD), which the company attributed primarily to medical cost trends that significantly exceeded pricing, driven by both unit costs and volumes (including provider coding/service intensity), as well as the ongoing effects of Medicare funding reductions.

Looking at underlying trend by business, management noted that the previously cited increase in care activity across individual/group MA has now begun to affect more complex populations (e.g. D-SNP, C-SNP) as well as the Medicare supplement book. With that, elevated trend is now broad-based both geographically and across different membership segments, including the company's retained membership base. At the service line level, management suggested that physician and outpatient care has represented a combined 70% of the pressure year-to-date. However, inpatient utilization has also accelerated through 2Q25, with UnitedHealth citing increases in ER visits and observation stays (alongside more bundling and service/

billing intensity). With that, inpatient is now expected to represent a larger portion (relative to 1H25) of the overall trend pressure seen through full-year 2025. In terms of overall sizing, management suggested that MA trend is expected to be approximately 7.5% in 2025, clearly higher than the company's initial pricing for 5.0% y/y (i.e. consistent with cost trend observed in 2024). Specific to Medicare supplement, that product is seeing cost trend of 11% in 2025, which is also significantly elevated from trend of 8%-9% seen in recent years. Management cited the Medicare supplement pressure as further evidence of the broad-based nature of utilization and billing pattern pressures across the Medicare population.

Turning to the commercial book, management disclosed that the company was now seeing higher than expected medical cost increases, particularly in outpatient care (and to a lesser extent inpatient care). This included specific callouts for pressure related to orthopedic spending and pharmacy infusions. Taken altogether, the company noted that its group risk business was seeing cost trend approach 11% in 2025, which is about 100bps higher than initial expectations. Specific to the ACA marketplace business, UnitedHealth spoke to pressure stemming primarily from revenue impacts related to higher than expected market morbidity (relative to the company's 2025 pricing).

Finally, in the Medicaid segment the company spoke to pressure related to an unanticipated acceleration in behavioral cost trend, which was cited at 20% y/y. Management also cited additional pressure related to pharmacy and home health, as well as a broad increase in provider service/billing intensity. Notably, management currently expects that the mismatch between Medicaid rates and acuity will extend well into 2026.

2) Turning to quality metrics, UnitedHealth noted that its 2Q25 results included a negative $70 million in unfavorable development, with nearly the entirety of that total being attributed to 2025 dates of service. DCP came in at 44.5 days, down -1.0 day q/q and -0.7 days q/q as management noted Medicare Part D program changes resulting from the IRA. Finally, we note that medical payables were up 18.1% y/y, while premiums increased 14.3% y/y.

3) Though the segment is clearly seeing a setback in 2025, management made clear that OptumHealth will continue to grow its VBC book over the long-term. In fact, the company stressed that the current environment of rising healthcare unit costs, elevated utilization, and higher provider coding intensity only further underscored the importance of VBC in bending the cost curve and improving underlying health. In 2025, we now project that OptumHealth will generate $101.3 billion in revenues from an average of 98.3 million consumers served. Notably, we expect the average number of consumers served to fall -4.6% y/y in 2025, largely reflecting a decline of -4 million experienced in 4Q24. According to management, the decrease experienced at the end of 2024 reflects portfolio actions that de-emphasized certain areas such as urgent care. Management explained that standalone urgent care centers have become less important to the overall strategy, with after-hours availability at Optum medical centers able to fill that void. It is our understanding that the sale of MedExpress centers to UPMC/GoHealth drove most of the -4 million sequential decline in consumers served in 4Q24, alongside a smaller impact from the sale of certain small lab businesses (buyer not disclosed).

With those changes, we estimate that OptumHealth will generate an average PMPM per consumer of ~$86 in 2025, which would be roughly flat y/y. PMPM growth would have been stronger if not for the larger than expected headwinds related to new member profiles and MA funding/risk model changes impacting complex beneficiaries. OptumHealth is also migrating legacy partial risk arrangements to FFS, which is expected to drive a more than ~$5 billion y/y decrease in segment revenues for 2025. Finally, the company has also moderated its expectations for full-year global cap enrollment growth to ~300K y/y in 2025, down from its prior expectation of ~650K y/y.

The transition to fully capitated arrangements is significant, as we estimate those consumers are generating significantly higher PMPMs. Based on previous conversations with

management, the globally capitated book in OptumCare represented close to ~60% of total OptumHealth revenues in 2023, implying full risk revenues of over $56.5 billion (or a PMPM of $1,149 on global cap lives). After growth of ~550K globally capitated lives in 2024 and an additional ~300K in 2025, we estimate that OptumHealth's fully capitated revenue could approach ~$65.8 billion this year (or ~65% of total segment revenues), with a PMPM of $1,097. According to management, the VBC book is operating a pre-tax margin of just 1% in 2025, down from over 3% in 2024 and nearly 5% in 2023. This would also be well below the company's long-term margin target of 5% for the VBC business.

As a caveat, we continue to believe that OptumCare's relationships with external plans are not keeping pace with the amount of business they are doing with UnitedHealthcare. We know that UnitedHealthcare is the largest customer for OptumCare (including a little over ~50% of the full cap book) and it appears that its concentration has grown over the past several years. We don't have eliminations for just OptumCare so we are forced to use the total OptumHealth eliminations as a proxy. As shown below, OptumHealth reported total revenues in 2Q25 of $25.2 billion of which we estimate that just $9.6 billion was to external partners. With that, the eliminations line (the amount of OptumHealth services that were provided to UnitedHealthcare) would be 62.0% in 2Q25, up 72bps from the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, we estimate that total OptumHealth revenues decreased by -6.8% y/y in 2Q25, whereas eliminations fell at a slightly slower pace of -5.7% y/y.

4) With the results of the quarter, UnitedHealth reinstated 2025 guidance across virtually all metrics. Starting with adjusted EPS, the company is now guiding to full-year 2025 EPS of at least $16.00, with the midpoint coming in $5.25 (24.7%) below our prior estimate of $21.25 per share, as well as $4.64 (22.5%) lower than the consensus of $20.64. For further perspective, the midpoint of revised 2025 guidance represents a further cut of $10.25 per share (39.0%) from prior 1Q25 guidance (i.e. prior to rescission), and is now $13.75 (46.2%) below the initial outlook. According to management, the revised 2025 EPS outlook reflects 1H25 performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, including higher realized and anticipated care trends. Notably, 2025 guidance also now includes about $1.6 billion (or roughly ~$1.40 per share) of settlement items that appear to be related primarily to prior years. As a very rough breakdown, about ~$500 million of those settlements is related to the OptumHealth segment, with ~$850 million attributable to UHC, ~$200 million to OptumInsight, slightly less than ~$100 million to OptumRx, and roughly ~$100 million to corporate items.

Moving to the topline outlook, UnitedHealth is now guiding to full-year revenue of $445.5-$448.0 billion, with the midpoint representing a cut of $5.8 billion (1.3%) from the prior outlook. This decrease is being driven entirely by Optum, which is now expected to record full-year revenues of $266.0-$267.5 billion. That would be down -$11.8 billion (4.2%) from the initial outlook, driven primarily by OptumHealth. OptumHealth is now expected to record full-year revenue of $101.1-$101.6 billion, down from the guidance range of $106.0-$107.0 billion in 1Q25, and even further below the initial outlook of $116.0-$117.0 billion. The incremental decline in OptumHealth revenue guidance comes as the company has reduced its planned expansion of fully capitated lives, which is now expected to grow 300K in 2025 (vs 650K previously).

Turning to MLR, the company is now guiding to a full year MLR in the range of 89.0%-89.5%, with the midpoint coming in 67bps above our prior estimate and 45bps higher than the consensus. The updated MLR outlook is also 175bps higher than the company's prior guidance range of 87.0%-88.0% as of 1Q25, and 275bps above the initial outlook of 86.0%-87.0%.

Below, we refocus on the segment-level guidance updates starting with UnitedHealthcare. Total revenues are now expected in the range of $344.0-$345.5 billion, up $6.3 billion (1.8%) from the initial outlook driven by the Medicare & Retirement (up $5.9 billion) and Community & State segments (up $2.0 billion). This is partially offset by a -$1.7 billion cut to the midpoint of initial guidance for full-year Employer & Individual revenues. In terms of operating earnings, the segment is now expected to generate $9.0-$9.3 billion for full-year 2025, down -$8.6 billion (48.5%) from the initial outlook. Approximately $6.5 billion of that cut was attributed to higher medical costs relative to initial guidance, with an additional $1.0 billion related to the removal of previously planned portfolio actions, and $850 million of other items (e.g. unfavorable prior period items and one-time settlements). Parsing out the $6.5 billion in medical cost pressure, management attributed $3.6 billion (or 55%) to the broad Medicare portfolio, while $2.3 billion (35%) is related to the commercial business (roughly evenly split between ACA exchange and commercial group), and the remaining $0.6 billion (10%) to Medicaid primarily due to elevated behavioral trend. Specific to the Medicare pressure, management made clear that its 2025 MA bids significantly underestimated medical cost trend (i.e. did not adjust benefits sufficiently), which was compounded by plan exits across the sector and provider coding/service intensity.

Turning to Optum, total segment revenues are now expected to be $266.0-$267.5 billion, down -$11.8 billion (4.2%) from the initial midpoint due to a decline of -$15.2 billion (13.0%) at OptumHealth and -$2.3 (10.5%) billion at OptumInsight. This is partially offset by an increase of $5.3 billion (3.6%) in expected OptumRx revenue. Turning to operating earnings, Optum is now expected to generate $12.55-$12.85 billion in 2025, representing a cut of $7.9 billion (38.2%) from the initial outlook. By sub-segment, OptumInsight is driving about $0.9 billion (or 12%) of this decrease, with about half relative to a slower than expected recovery in customer volumes post the cyberattack, as well as one-time cyber related expenses. The other half was credited to a pause in previously planned portfolio actions in an effort to better prioritize growth and innovation across the OptumInsight product portfolio. OptumRx is driving about $0.4 billion (or 5%) of the segment earnings guidance decrease, with management speaking to a series of items that are negatively impacting performance in 2025. This includes a $150 million headwind related to the removal of previously planned portfolio actions, a $150 million headwind from the initial launch of the Nuvaila private label business, a $150 million headwind from GLP-1s, and a $50 million negative impact relating to ancillary businesses where the company is taking corrective pricing actions and adjusting plans. Finally, OptumHealth is driving a very significant $6.6 billion (or 83%) of Optum's

earnings guidance decrease, which we estimate implies margin compression of 650bps from previous expectations. Management spoke to a series of items that we outline further below:

* About $3.6 billion (or ~55%) of the decrease in OptumHealth's earnings guidance is related to the value-based care business, here an estimated cut to margin guidance of 550bps, with three primary drivers of relatively equal weight:
    1. Enrollment Mix (~$1.2 billion): This includes additional complex/dual eligible members and more new to Optum patients who are underserved. Specific to the new members, this cohort appears to largely be concentrated in markets where numerous plan exits occurred, and also includes complex patients that require time to be effectively management. Management disclosed that these member are currently seeing negative margins nearing double-digits in 2025, with an expectation to improve meaningfully in 2026.
    2. Accelerated Medical Trend (~$1.2 billion): The company noted that OptumHealth was seeing accelerated medical trend, with particular pressure among physician and outpatient services in Medicare and behavioral health in Medicaid. Elevated trend has been exacerbated by insufficient pricing within UHC (slightly over 50% of OptumHealth's full cap book) and other payer partners, resulting in negative pull-through in capitated arrangements. Even with that headwind, OptumHealth's fully capitated book is still generating a positive operating margin of 1% in 2025, though that is down from over 3% in 2024 and nearly 5% in 2023. Remember, that margin has also been burdened by strong capitated membership growth, with ~40% of full-risk lives served today having come onto the platform since the start of 2024. Margins improve the longer a patient stays, with the pre-2022 cohort of patients operating an 8%+ margin in 2025, while the 2022/2023 cohorts are at a 2% margin, and the 2024/2025 cohorts are negative.
    3. New Member Risk Status and V28 (~$1.2 billion): OptumHealth underestimated new members' risk status as they came onto the care platform, and has seen suboptimal execution with respect to the V28 risk model transition. Specific to v28, management sized the transition as a cumulative $11 billion headwind form 2024-2026 ($2 billion higher than initially expected), with $7 billion of that impact realized through 2025 ($1 billion above prior expectations).
* About $2.0 billion (or ~30%) of the decrease relates to the company's decision to discontinue certain previously planned portfolio actions.
* Finally, the remaining $1.0 billion (or ~15%) of the decrease reflects the combination of lower service volumes in FFS businesses, non-recurring prior period impacts, and the slowing of tuck-in acquisitions. For perspective, management noted that the company had originally planned for ~20 million FFS visits in 2025, but is currently tracking towards ~19 million (or ~5% lower).

In terms of EPS seasonality, management noted that the quarterly progression of earnings would be impacted by Part D changes related to the IRA. With that, the company suggested a 2H25 MLR of 91.5% (vs 87.1% in 1H25) with 4Q25 expected to be the highest for the year. With that, our updated model now implied 3Q25 EPS of $2.50 per share, which compares to the current consensus of $4.64 (which will migrate lower after today's disclosures).

5) Turning to 2026, it is clear that the 2H25 run rate is not the appropriate jumping off point for 2026 EPS. As shown below, revised 2025 guidance implies steep declines in operating earnings for most business lines in 2H25. To reach the midpoint of full-year guidance, OptumHealth would have to generate just $800 million in operating earnings during 2H25, which would be down -79.8% relative to 2H24. This would be much worse than the 1H25 decrease of closer to -43.4% y/y. Implied 2H25 earnings for OptumInsight would also be down -40.1% y/y (vs up 18.4% y/y in 1H25), while OptumRx would be up 0.2% y/y in 2H25 (vs up 8.1% y/y in 1H25). At the segment level, Optum's implied 2H25 earnings are $5.7 billion, down -42.5% y/y (vs -14.9% y/y in 1H25). UnitedHealthcare's implied 2H25 earnings are just $1.8 billion, down -74.5% y/y (vs -18.9% y/y in 1H25).

In terms of EPS, full-year guidance implies just $4.72 per share in 2H25 (or closer to ~$5.60 per share excluding out-of-period settlements), which would be down -66.2% y/y. This would also be much morse than the -17.7% y/y decline in 1H25. Clearly, 2H25 EPS is being burdened by several items (e.g. OOP settlements, discontinued portfolio actions, investment spending) that make it an understated representation of the company's annual run-rate moving forward. This is especially true given the significant benefit of pricing expected after ~80% of UHC premiums re-rate on January 1st, 2026. Conversely, 1H25 is also clearly not the right jumping off point for 2026 given the impact of seasonality and what appears to be worsening trend through the balance of 2025.

Remember, management spoke to a number of tailwinds that are ultimately expected to culminate in a “moderate” level of earnings growth in 2026:

* Within UnitedHealthcare, management noted that 2026 pricing will be intensely focused on margin recovery, with ~80% of premiums expected to re-rate on January 1st, 2026. Beyond its general pricing commentary, the company also spoke to broad initiatives around improvements in clinical policy, auditing, and payment integrity tools to combat the higher coding intensity/billing practices seen across the industry.
* Relative to MA, the company noted that it was working to improve its MA performance through a combination of product design and benefit changes. Specifically, UnitedHealth expects to shift its focus to more managed products that have tighter networks (e.g. HMOs). With that, the company has decided to exit plans currently serving over ~600K members (mostly in PPO products). Management has also priced the product to an expected medical cost trend of ~10% in 2026, up from the trend of 7.5% y/y seen in 2025. Management suggested that this pricing accounts for further underlying trend acceleration in 2026, as well as fee schedule updates and the continuation of higher provider coding/billing intensity. With that, the Medicare book is expected to see margin expansion into the range of 2.5%-3.0% in 2026, with management targeting a return to the long-term target midpoint of ~3% by 2027.

* Within Medicaid, the company continues to actively engage with state partners, though the lag between rates and member acuity is expected to continue well into 2026. This dynamic will result in additional margin compression in the segment, including an expected loss of -1.0% to -1.7% on the non-dual business in 2026 (vs break-even in 2025). Management suggested that the company remained committed to the Medicaid program, but with the requirement that states support a responsible level of funding.
* In the commercial business, UnitedHealth is pricing with the anticipation that higher trend will continue into 2026 and 2027. Specifically, the company is pricing its commercial book for trend above ~11% in 2026. Given this level of pricing, management expects to see increased membership declines, as well as a shift from group risk into level-funded and self-funded products. Within the ACA exchange business, UnitedHealth clarified that it continues to expect to participate in a majority of the 30 markets across its current footprint, but is prepared to exit select markets if approved rate updates are not necessary to reflect higher market acuity and the potential for adverse selection post the enhanced APTC expiration. Overall, the company expects to see margin recovery across both its ACA exchange and group business in 2026, moving from "well below" its margin target in 2025 to "modestly short" of its 7%-9% targeted range in 2026. In 2027, the company expects to be able to improve margins into that long-term range.
* Management also provided a detailed overview of its actions to improve performance within OptumHealth, such as $1 billion in expected cost reduction (including efficiency gains related to technology integration and AI) and improvements in the consistency of its clinical model. Management also detailed a number of anticipated improvements across both of OptumHealth's VBC and FFS books:
    * Within the VBC book (65% of OptumHealth revenue), the company noted that it had aligned 2026 benefits, products, and footprint to address the incremental $4 billion v28 headwind in 2026. This includes the decision to cease VBC arrangements for 200K patients in 2026, which will mitigate about half of the v28 headwind. These exited members are largely concentrated within PPO products, with the exit representing about ~40% of the PPO patients currently served today. Management expects to continue to narrow exposure to that product type beyond 2026 as well. The remaining $2 billion of v28 headwind will be offset by a combination of operating cost discipline and execution of care management programs. Taken together, the company expects margins within its VBC book to remain relatively flat at 1% in 2026, before beginning to show expansion in 2027.
    * Turning to the FFS book (15% of OptumHealth revenue), the company disclosed that certain PCP and multi-specialty practices that are not yet fully accountable (but support VBC) are running at negative margins and generating "hundreds of millions of losses" in 2025. The company is actively working to improve payment yields and productivity for 2026, which is expected to result in strong year-over-year growth next year.

6) Overall membership came in -0.2% below our estimate for the quarter, with weaker than expected commercial ASO, PDP, Medicaid, Medicare Supplement, and international enrollment more than offsetting favorability in commercial risk and MA. As the chart below shows, total membership in 2Q25 came in at 54.08mm. This was approximately -0.2% (121K) lower than our estimate, reflecting weaker than expected enrollment in commercial ASO (-0.2% below our estimate), Medicare Part D (-0.2% below), Medicaid (-1.5% below), international (-0.5% below), and Medicare Supplement (-0.3% below). In contrast, we note

that commercial risk and MA enrollment both came in a respective 0.1% and 0.6% above our estimates for 2Q25.

Turning to guidance, UnitedHealth provided an updated membership outlook across all segments for 2025. At the highest level, UnitedHealth is now guiding to total membership growth (excluding international) of 835K (1.6%) y/y in 2025. This is down about -615K from the midpoint of the company's initial outlook, which implied growth of closer to 1.45 million. Commercial membership is the largest driver of this decrease, with risk enrollment now expected to decline -385K (-4.4%) y/y. This would be -535K below the initial guidance midpoint for growth of 150K y/y, with one-third of that decrease being attributed to the ACA exchange book (and the balance to commercial group).

7) According to the statement of cash flows, UnitedHealth used $32 million of cash in the second quarter for acquisitions, which was down from the $702 million spent in 1Q25 but slightly up from the $25 million spent in 2Q24 (which was one of the lowest quarterly totals in the past several years). The reduction in M&A spend comes as the company spoke to the discontinuance of previously planned portfolio actions across all segments (e.g. UHC, OptumHealth, OptumInsight, and OptumRx), which appears to encompass spending on tuck-in acquisitions (among other items). That said, the company still appears to be targeting the completion of the Amedisys acquisition by year-end.

As a reminder, UnitedHealth has spent at least $200 million in cash on acquisitions in all but 6 of the last 25 quarters. Obviously, those are GAAP reported totals so there are likely some true-ups/downs that impact quarters, but it is clear that UnitedHealth has typically been fairly acquisitive every quarter despite the lower M&A activity in 2Q25. Over the past five years, UnitedHealth has spent a total of ~$53.8 billion on M&A.

8) UnitedHealth's 2Q25 EPS result missed the consensus estimate for the second consecutive quarter. Putting numbers to it, UnitedHealth reported adjusted EPS of $4.08 in 2Q25, which was -8.9% below the consensus of $4.48. Remember, prior to the miss in 1Q25 the company had not missed the consensus estimate in any quarter since 2Q08.

Notably, the 2Q25 result included a total $1.2 billion (or $1.07 per share) of "discrete impacts", with about $620 million related to losses on the individual exchange business that were accelerated into 2Q25 (i.e. PDR). The remaining ~$580 million is related to the settlement of outstanding receivables (mostly related to prior years) for which collection is now in doubt. Adjusting the 2Q25 result to exclude those $1.2 billion in expenses, we estimate that EPS would have been closer to about $5.15 per share.

9) UnitedHealth's MA growth has significantly outpaced the overall market in 2025. Based on CMS data files, we estimate that UnitedHealth's total MA enrollment (including duals) has grown 6.5% YTD through 1H25, or approximately 432bps faster than the overall industry growth rate of 2.2% YTD. This outsized growth has contributed to financial challenges, with the company now expecting its MA margin to run in the range of 2.0%-2.5% in 2025. This represents the low-end of the long-term target of 2%-4%. Remember, UnitedHealth had previously guided to a long-term segment margin target of 3%-5%, though that was officially

lowered to 2%-4% on the 2Q25 earnings call given incremental Part D revenues stemming from the IRA. These revenues are not attached to any significant earnings contribution, resulting in the downward impact to the long-term margin target range.

Moving into 2026, the company is working to improve its MA performance through a combination of product design and benefit changes. Specifically, UnitedHealth expects to shift its focus to more managed products that have tighter networks (e.g. HMOs). With that, the company has decided to exit plans currently serving over ~600K members (mostly in PPO products). Management has also priced the product to an expected medical cost trend of ~10% in 2026, up from the trend of 7.5% y/y seen in 2025. Management suggested that this pricing accounts for further underlying trend acceleration in 2026, as well as fee schedule updates and the continuation of higher provider coding/billing intensity. With that, the Medicare book is expected to see margin expansion into the range of 2.5%-3.0% in 2026, with management targeting a return to the long-term target midpoint of ~3% by 2027.

10) Repurchases continued to represent the greatest use of capital during the quarter. We note that UnitedHealth spent $2.5 billion on share repurchases during the quarter, representing 47% of total spend. Absolute spending on repurchases was also up significantly from the period (when the company temporarily halted buybacks). Looking forward, management noted that its revised share count guidance of 912-914 million for 2025 contemplates no further buybacks through the balance of 2025.

Dividends represented the second largest use of capital during 2Q25. UnitedHealth paid out approximately $2.0 billion in dividends during the second quarter, representing 37% of total quarterly spend. This was actually well below the ~69% of spend allocated to dividends in 2Q24, but is materially higher than the historical average of ~19%. On an absolute basis, spending on dividends actually increased $65 million (3.4%) y/y relative to 2Q24.

UnitedHealth spent $886 million in cash on capex during 2Q25, representing approximately ~16% of total quarterly spending. This was down from ~30% of spend allocated to capex in the prior year quarter, though absolute capex increased $33 million (3.9%) y/y.

Acquisitions represented the smallest use of capital during 2Q25, as the company has clearly moderated M&A. This contrasts with the company's historical trend, with acquisitions typically representing the largest use of capital from 2008-2024. In total, UnitedHealth spent just $35 million on acquisitions during 2Q25, one of the lowest quarterly totals in many years.

## July 29, 2025
Acquisitions represented approximately ~1% of total spend in 2Q25, which compares to the annual average of 42% from 2008-2024.

Taking a longer view, UnitedHealth has generated a total of $236.6 billion in cash flow from operations over the 17-year period from 2008-2024. The company spent 108% of this amount, or $255.6 billion, on a combination of capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions (just the cash component), and dividends to shareholders.

11) Performance in Optum is clearly challenged for 2025, though the segment remains a key component of overall enterprise results and strategy. For background, UnitedHealth formally announced the "Optum" brand in 2011 and since then Optum has grown from $28.6 billion to approximately $271.8 billion in estimated annual revenues for 2025. In terms of growth and importance, Optum has been critical to the overall company and has been a key driver for both topline and earnings growth. As the chart below shows, we estimate that revenues (pre-eliminations) at Optum will grow at a CAGR of 14.5% from 2020 to 2025, far outpacing growth of 11.4% at UnitedHealthcare. As a result, we estimate that Optum revenues will represent 44.1% of total revenues in 2025, up 334bps from 2020. That said, we are seeing topline growth at UnitedHealthcare actually outpace Optum in 2025 – the first time this has happened since 2018. We estimate that revenues will grow 15.6% y/y for UHC in 2025, about ~999bps higher than projected growth of 5.6% y/y at Optum.

Clearly, there are positive return implications for the long term growth of Optum. Unlike the insurance business, Optum's healthcare services are not restricted by risk-based capital requirements or profitability rules (i.e. minimum MLR, risk corridors, etc.) allowing the company to retain a higher share of revenues. Fueled by strong topline growth and a more attractive margin structure, we project that Optum's earnings will grow at an average annual rate of 4.9% from 2010-2025E, far outpacing the CAGR of -6.9% seen at UnitedHealthcare.

With that, Optum earnings are projected to grow from 44.8% of total company profits in 2020 to approximately 59.6% in 2025.

Next, we show the revenue and earnings contribution from Optum relative to overall growth (which includes both Optum and UnitedHealth). Here we are trying to show the importance of Optum to the growth of UnitedHealth Group (and not just the % of total). Over the two-year period from 2017 to 2019, Optum contributed 42.1% to overall company revenue growth (pre-eliminations). This accelerated markedly in 2020 (77.0% of enterprise revenue growth) and remained strong in 2021 (46.9%), 2022 (51.0%), and 2023 (58.6%). Optum contributed 61.6% of overall company revenue growth in 2024, which we project will drop to a more measured 23.7% in 2025.

Similar to 2024, we expect growth at Optum to be led by OptumRx in 2025, comprising ~29.5% of enterprise revenue growth this year. This is followed distantly by OptumInsight (~0.8%), while OptumHealth is actually expected to be a drag equivalent to -6.7% of enterprise revenue growth in 2025. On a year-over-year basis, we project that revenues at OptumRx will grow 13.5% y/y, with management citing strong customer retention and a record 750 new clients being onboarded as well. We project that OptumInsight will see revenue growth of 2.6% y/y, even as management spoke to a slower than expected recovery in customer volumes post the cyberattack. In contrast, we project that OptumHealth will see revenues decline -3.9% y/y in 2025, which includes the previously cited headwind of $10 billion from the transition of certain partial risk contracts to FFS. In addition, the segment is being negatively impacted by lower than expected reimbursement related to the profile of members added from exiting MA plans (i.e. weaker risk scores), as well continued MA funding/risk model changes impacting complex members. Notably, our revised estimate also now includes revised expectations for lower FFS volumes and growth in full-risk membership, which is now expected to increase 300K y/y in 2025 (vs prior guidance of 650K y/y).

From an earnings perspective, the growth contribution from Optum has tended to be even more pronounced. Despite a step-back in 2020, Optum contributed 124.5% of growth in total operating earnings during 2021 (more than compensating for the expected decline at UnitedHealthcare), followed by 46.2% in 2022 and 48.1% in 2023. The segment contributed 108.2% of total enterprise operating earnings growth in 2024.

Turning to 2025, we actually expect total Optum earnings to decline -29.8% y/y, which is slightly favorable relative to the projected decline of -46.7% y/y at UnitedHealthcare. With that, we estimate that Optum will drive 41.6% of the year-over-year decrease in enterprise earnings for 2025, driven primarily by OptumHealth. Given the previously outlined headwinds in OptumHealth, we estimate that operating earnings for the segment will come in at $3.05 billion in 2025, down -$4.9 billion (61.5%) y/y. For perspective, that would represent -37.5% of the total decrease in enterprise operating earnings of -$13.0 billion (37.8%) y/y. We also estimate that OptumInsight will see earnings decline -$743 million (16.9%) y/y in 2025, whereas OptumRx will see growth of $214 million (3.7%).

In terms of operating margins, we estimate a 3.0% margin for OptumHealth in 2025. This is well below the segment's new long-term margin target of 6%-8%, which was revised down from the prior range of 8%-10% on the 2Q25 earnings call. According to management, the downward revision reflects a more elongated path to margin maturation among new VBC cohorts, as well as the expectation that the segment will continue to add new VBC lives over the foreseeable future. Remember, older cohorts (i.e. 2021 vintage and prior) were cited as running at 8%+ margins in 2025, whereas new members added in 2024/2025 are in the negative range.

12) Cash flow in the quarter was reported as an inflow of $7.19 billion or approximately 2.0x net income. With that, CFFO came in 17.8% higher than our estimate for an inflow of $6.10 billion. For full-year 2025, UnitedHealth now expects its CFFO to be $16.0 billion, or 1.1x net income. Remember, that represents a cut of -$16.5 billion (50.8%) from the initial guidance range of $32.0-$33.0 billion.

Taking a step back, we note that financing the growth of healthcare in the United States has been a good place to be for several decades, and we don't see that growth abating over the long-term. In addition, Optum provides a longer-term set of opportunities for which investment dollars can be levered into higher growth and returns. Said another way, UnitedHealth's cash flow position, coupled with Optum's platform, continues to provide a strong case for long-term growth.

Nephron uses an absolute rating system which rates the stocks of issuers as Buy, Sell, or Hold (see definitions below) backed by a 12 Month price target. Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's expectation of where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided, represent identified potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period. Buy - Current stock price generally represents upside to our 12-month price target of 20%+. Sell - Current stock price generally represents downside to our 12-month price target of 20%+. Hold - Current stock generally represents limited opportunities on both the long and short side over 12-month period.
