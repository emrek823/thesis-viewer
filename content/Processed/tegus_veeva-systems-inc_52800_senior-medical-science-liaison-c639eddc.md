# Tegus
## Veeva Systems Inc - Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
### Interview conducted on February 14, 2023

### Topics
Medical Information Requests, Self-Service Portal, Low-Code Automation, Compliance, CRM Integration, Dashboard, Adverse Event Reporting, Resource Utilization

### Summary
During a conversation between the Tegus Client and a Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, they discussed a new product that would replace manual processing for small to midsized companies doing MIR processing. The expert had questions about the expected integration with other data sources and the back-end work needed for the product. They also discussed the self-service portal for HCPs and the need for commercial colleagues to have access to it. The Tegus Client asked about the attestation process for commercial med info requests and the expert explained the potential pathways for commercial to take. They also discussed the self-service portal and dashboard for med info requests, suggesting additional attributes for adverse event reporting and the need for standard response letters to go through a review and approval process before being shared with HCPs. The Tegus Client also asked about initiating a process for a new SRL to be reviewed and approved through the MIR application, which the expert agreed would be valuable for small or mid-sized companies.

### Expert Details
Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The expert is responsible for the immunology therapy area covering Immunoglobulins for primary immune deficiency, immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy, and C1-Inhibitor for HAE. The expert has a PhD in Cell Biology and Neuroscience with experience with both site and sponsor side clinical trial activities, including IDE device trials, and patient registry programs.

The expert can speak to neurospace, specialty pharmacies, targeted immunotherapies, IDEAL (Immunoglobulin G), AL1TER (Alpha-1 Anti-trypsin), cancer stem cell biology, Parkinson's disease, and INTERPRET (Cardiac Inotropes).

### Tegus Client
Hi. So to get into it, we just want to kind of go through mockups and prototypes, both at a high level and then getting a little more technically detailed and get an understanding of how this may fit. This doesn't have to do with a Veeva solution or anything like that or a third-party call center.

But this is really meant to be a significant improvement for small to midsized companies doing all of this MIR processing manually and being able to stay compliant and being able to handle these requests, route them to the right people and getting them work through. So based upon what you saw, do you think that this is a viable product to replace a manual process that might be used by a small to midsized company?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
I believe so. I mean, as I said sort of reviewing it, I was very much struck by sort of the clean user interface through it, good use of sort of the drop-downs. I think from a process standpoint, it certainly would make things a lot simpler for, like you said, probably a very lean medical information group at a smaller company. This is obviously the front end, but the back end is going to have to carry some of the data. So I guess maybe my question is what's the expected integration with any other data source for this? The intent was this was being filled out by the clinician. Is that correct?

### Tegus Client
So there's two views of it. The first view on Slide two is the self-service portal that will be filled in by the HCP looking to either get information or report an adverse event or something like that. So this is what the external entity is going to see and fill in. It's really Slide number three, where we go through and what happens after this gets submitted into the company for processing.

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
Okay. Yes, because I saw the dashboard and the dashboard looks very nice on that, I see the medical information requests sort of the drop-downs. No, I mean, I definitely think like, again, not to go too deep into it, but that's obviously the sort of linkage with this is that you've got to have some sort of back-end database that basically either has all of your documents, all your standard response letters or things like that sort of ready to be populated.

And then it's probably some level of off-the-shelf, but some pretty significant level of company specific data sets because as I go through Slide three, I feel like the one where it kind of goes like the MIR response, and it looks like some of those are kind of pre-populated both by the drug and some of the adverse events.

So it definitely feels like the back-end work is definitely going to have to be a collaboration between the organization and the company about what needs to show up in these things, but also where they're going to sort of house any of their other documents that are sort of coming in, like you said, the attachments.

So that's sort of my first thought with that from the Slide three background, but just more on the back end. But the front end looks really great. I think the only other thing depending on it is sort of where this kind of gets routed not so much internal med info metrics, but where this sort of shows up to for the field-based MSLs.

Right now that they need to be sort of linked into what's kind of going out and what's kind of coming in? And I know every company sort of has a little bit different policy around that. But at least for my current role, we are sort of kept abreast of these information requests coming in.

But generally, there's been a sort of an MSL follow-up requested. And that may be more on Slide two, but that's probably part of the back-end work as well about making sure that if they had an MSL follow-up that's getting routed for the MSL two follow-up and even if there wasn't necessarily MSL follow-up requested that an MSL like is made aware that this request came in from somebody in their territory.

With no other action needed other than it's a request that came in. So those would be some of the things that, again, as I'm kind of watching the demo roll through, just kind of jumped out at me at the beginning of the thing of what I was looking for.

### Tegus Client
That's helpful. And regarding the MSLs, we're thinking about that in two ways. One way is it's certainly possible that the MSL could be the person that's receiving this request. And then is responsible for facilitating the response, either by understanding what some of the attributes are that need to be filled out.

Like the indications, contraindications, warnings and things like that as well as selecting a standard response. Or it could be a med info person that's doing this response and us providing the MSL some insider access into the requests that are coming in either all of them or by territory or however we would customize that for the customer. Does that seem to make sense?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
Yes. On the self-service portal for the HCP, in my experience, this is a hard thing to kind of lock down with HCPs. A lot of times, they will sort of try and pass the buck to be fair. So the typical situation that I hear is basically it's a commercial colleague in a clinic, they're talking to the doctor. The doctor basically asks an off-label question. And the commercial person basically says it's an off-label question. I can't answer it, would you like to fill out or would you like me to submit a med info request?

And 90% of the time, the clinician basically says, well, you can go ahead and fill this in and send it. I don't have the time to fill it all out. But to be fair, I don't profess to be a regulatory expert. So how much of this is sort of hard and fast versus sort of company interpretation, I'm not entirely clear.

But I can tell you right now, for my company, the front end is accessible, again, through Veeva to the commercial colleagues, but that they need to basically document that the HCP is making the request more so than just being able to submit this med info request without that sort of documentation.

So commercial has to do that. MSLs don't. I can put a med info request in from a doctor that basically doesn't require me to sort of document the reactive nature of the question that the commercial colleagues have.

So again, not trying to get dragged too far into the weeds on this, but one thing I would say is that the self-service portal, if the intent is for the majority of the engagement to be done via the HCP, that may not fly as much, at least on that front end because commercial is likely going to need to have access to this.

And maybe even MSL and field medical to basically be able to generate the request themselves and basically get the physician to acknowledge at least on the commercial side, the sending of the request. And at least on the MSL side send it into med info.

So again, that's just sort of my take on that because if this is designed strictly and only for the HCP to use and access and directly do that, I don't know what the uptake will actually be by HCPs to be quite honest with you. My experience has been that it can be low. It depends on how motivated the HCP is, how sort of urgent, emergent or direct patient relation the question is.

But a lot of times, it's more of a random question, a random thought or even something that's kind of peripherally related to a patient, but isn't necessarily something that is going to have a huge dramatic impact at this point in time on their care.

So their willingness to sort of fill this out, again, even as simple and as clean as you've made it is still probably going to be a little bit up in the air. So I think that's going to be one of the things at least on Slide two on the front end about who can do this and how can it be properly documented sort of who's doing it and the HCP is and things like that.

But it's nice that you've sort of got it all linked together between med info, adverse event and product technical complaint because I don't often see those sort of get as cleanly linked as being funneled through med info as others will. You kind of have to read the context of things, it's not as clean of a drop down like you have. So I really like that.

### Tegus Client
That's an interesting insight. And I understand about maybe in HCP being reluctant or too busy or doesn't want to go ahead and fill in all this information. And it might be up to the MSL to fill it in on their behalf. Now especially on the commercial side, if they needed some type of rationale or justification saying, "Hey, the doctor asked me this question, and I'm submitting this."

What kind of attestation would need to be attached or scanned or hey, doc, just click here, just to say that this is cool, what kind of thing would that take in order to make sure that the HCP has kind of initiated this and commercial isn't doing this on their own?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
I think it's going to vary a little bit. I'm going a little bit off memory here because obviously, I can't see what the commercial med info request is because my med info request is completely different. But my understanding is that there's two potential pathways commercial can take. One is basically, they can pull up in Veeva the medical information request. And if I recall correctly, there is either an actual physical like box that the person can use a touch screen or a stylus or whatever and sign their signature.

Or they can just do sort of the e-signature, which is where they type their name and basically that it's under this attestation that basically says, I'm an HCP basically requesting this information. But by and large, the top part as it were, is being filled out by the commercial person.

And then the commercial person sort of hands the iPad over to the doctor and says, yes, that's exactly what I want to know, okay, scribbles a signature on it or types their name and then it goes forward. Now if this comes as something either a phone call, an e-mail or literally the physician is like asking the question on their way out of the room because they have a patient. Then what the process is, is that the sales rep, the commercial colleague has to send an e-mail to the HCP and basically restate the question that the HCP is asking.

And basically saying, please reply to this e-mail acknowledging that this is what you're asking for, and then that gets forwarded to the med info team, and they will then process it that way. So if you're a commercial person and you can't get the clinician to basically acknowledge directly on your laptop or iPad in the Veeva System about the request, then it has to be done through e-mail.

Now again, I don't have to do that because the MSL are not required to sort of generate the aspect of this being a reactive request. I can send it indirectly saying physician asked me about this off-label question, because part of it is that our ability may actually be, I can verbally answer that question based off a standard response letter.

And it can sort of be documented as an off-label conversation and an off-label request. But many times, we will sort of do that as sort of a backup basically saying the physician wants the standard response letter, but I have verbalized what the standard response letter contains in it around the off-label request in a reactive manner.

So because of that, I can sort of submit that without sort of any attestation by the HCP. So in a sense, it may function kind of on a bit more of a sort of a hybrid med info type of function. But again, my general philosophy is that even if I'm sort of able to verbalize the majority of the answer, I still want an enduring record of that conversation, that off-label request or question.

And then med info to be able to document sending the SRL to the physician that provides what I stated plus maybe additional information because I remember a lot, but I don't always remember every single line from the SRL. So that's the two situations that I think again, you kind of have to deal with.

But I mean, unfortunately, that's probably a better question for somebody in the regulatory affairs group about sort of the level of attestation, but I can tell you that's what we do. And I can tell you, it's a pain. The fact that commercial has to sort of either get this in-person or attestation or basically get a reply to an email in order to process it from the commercial side, I understand why, but from my perspective, I think that's a barrier to med info requests being sort of generated and fulfilled to be quite honest with you.

### Tegus Client
Okay. And so just to get a little bit more technical here and to give you a little bit more background, we think that a big competitive advantages is that it's a low-code automation platform that's kind of built into the DNA and background as a company. And how familiar are you with intelligent automation?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
Somewhat. I don't profess to be an expert, but I'm at least familiar somewhat with the terminology.

### Tegus Client
Okay. So let's say you something that out of the box is like 70% to 80% of the way of meeting the requirements. And then it can be configured from there based upon whatever smaller medium life science company needs based on their requirements. We can configure those processes relatively quickly and easily for them.

So I think when we're talking about the sources of MIRs and where they come from, are we getting this right in that you're going to have the self-service portal where you want to kind of minimize the number of fields like we talked about, the HCP or someone else is going to have to fill out?

And then you're just going to have either the MSL or the med info people loading in the data, and they probably have a little bit more of an idea of what they would want to be filling out. Is there anything that we're missing here for the kind of sources that need to be captured in different ways in order to get data into the system for managing the MIRs.

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
So I'm looking again at sort of the dashboard in sort of Slide three because again, I think the front end looks very clean from the self-service portal. But again, I think there's three routes that these are going to come into the company.

They're either going to come in from the HCP directly via the portal. They're going to come into the portal via commercial having a conversation with an HCP and having to document that off-label question and then that's going to be sent in or it's going to come from an MSL.

And again, at least from my experience, the MSLs can sort of fill this out, kind of generate it on the fly, send it in and I think especially depending on how you have this set up for maybe what the different front ends look like for the medical versus commercial, there's probably a need for the med info request to basically from the medical side of things to allow for documentation of sort of a verbal response or response that was sort of based on an existing document.

And that ties into the metrics, too. If I'm talking to an HCP and they asked me a question, and I know it's part of an SRL and I basically respond verbally based on that SRL. Like I said, for me, I still would like to have the SRL since the physician, but the fact that I sort of used/referenced that SRL in my opinion and many others I think kind of look at it this way is that, that resource has been utilized.

So when people are saying, well, what SRLs should be renewed or updated, that utilization by field medical should count into the metrics around a resource utilization, not just how many times it was sent out. And now you talk about, okay, now everything is coming into, again, the in-house med info team, and they're sort of documenting this and then saying, who asked for it, what is it and how do we get it back to them. I would say one other thing too.

And whether or not it's an urgent request. But usually, there's a like turnaround time. Like if I've got a physician asking me a question because they've literally got a patient, for instance, like is on one of our drugs, but they're going to go get plasmapheresis.

And they're going to have pulled out. They need to know as the patients undergoing the plasmapheresis, what the supplemental dosing required that the patient needs within sort of a set period of time following that. So they can't wait for a three- to five-day turnaround.

So it doesn't look like I saw on there, but I would definitely say on the front end, everybody needs the option to basically make like the time frame for the reply to come back and basically flag urgent ones as being ones that need to have a response done like less than 24 hours.

Everybody sort of gets metric on like sort of the 24-hour turnaround, but our system basically says expected turnaround times, like, I think, one to two days, three to five days, greater than five days. So if it's something that's just sort of an idle curiosity question, then you can put it to three to five or greater than five days. If it's something that's a little bit more urgent because it's directly related to kind of a patient care question, it needs to be flagged as being able to be answered much faster.

### Tegus Client
So in that case, is that something that the HCP or whoever is filling out the request should specify or based upon the nature of the question or the request, that's something that a med info person can look at that and say, "Oh, this guy needs a response within 24 hours, I'm going to make this a priority one"?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
No, that needs to be specified on the front end. That either needs to be the clinician, the MSL or the commercial colleague being able to flag that on the front end of the request that this is an urgent matter requiring same day, if possible, response. There's always so much you can do. If something comes in at 5:00, your time and that's kind of up to what the company has available.

I know some people sort of do like outsourced like med info adverse event reporting hotlines where there's always somebody who's willing to pick up the phone and basically answer it on an on-call basis. But again, I don't know, that's probably dependent on company size.

But regardless, if this comes in sort of during normal business hours where it's been flagged as this requires urgent response or question related to direct patient care, less than 24-hour turnaround needed, that needs to be documented.

And you can't rely on med info to make that judgment call. That needs to be a drop-down or a check box that basically is available to the HCP, the commercial or the MSL to basically route that appropriately for med info to understand the time line request.

### Tegus Client
I appreciate that context. So in looking at, first of all, the self-service portal, and I know you've kind of given it high marks as far as how it looks and how it acts. And with the exception of what you just said about wanting to have some type of urgency entry there, was there anything else that you thought might be missing from the HCP portal solution?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
No. Everything looks really good. It definitely seems very clean and again watching the documentation, it looks like there's some prefilled things in. So at least on the front end, nothing is going to be necessarily prefilled in.

Everything is going to be drop down or typed in. But I think everything, other than that, I mean, it looks like I said, pretty solid, pretty fast and simple. But like I said, it's probably going to have to put something in there about the attestation.

Because I can see like the health care professional like that I could see being filled in by commercial or MSL, the med info request about the product name and the product question filled in by the commercial or MSL and then the acknowledgment section.

I mean, that's probably where you would have to put in the attestation on that acknowledgment section, basically saying that something for the HCP to document that themselves via a type or touchscreen signature or some other way to document the sort of reactive nature.

Because, again, I can tell you that if this is available, so if I'm a company of this size that has this portal in place, then my guess is that this seems at best, an app, at worst, at least a direct link to a website off of your iPad or your laptop.

And again, most people are using iPads on these sales calls, especially. You're going to want to have sort of the ability to kind of document that all at the acknowledgment stage but again, knowing that the MSL and/or the commercial is probably filling out the first two pages of this MIR.

So the health care professional, the contact information, it's probably all coming from the MSL or the thing and then the product information and then the product question. And then again, the other question here is that you have to be careful because it depends on sort of the company and sort of how their policies and procedures are in place.

But one thing I could see is, is this a sufficient documentation for sort of an adverse event report? Because usually, if you've got the adverse event report, that's probably going to need to flag patient initials, patient age, some additional level of information. So there's probably a little bit of an offshoot on that about using the portal for adverse event reporting as opposed to med info reporting, if that makes sense.

### Tegus Client
Right. There's some additional attributes that may need to be included for adverse event reporting because it's a requirement for things like patient identification and the particular drug.

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
Well, and you also make sure like date you were made aware because most places, and again, this is probably more on the federal side of things, but you need to report within 24 hours or one business day of being made aware of the event, not necessarily of the event happening itself but the time that you were made aware of it.

So if I'm an MSL and I'm talking to a doctor and the doctor tells me, "Hey, yes, last week, one of my patients threw a massive clot while they were getting their infusion or something like that." Then I have to basically document that and say, okay, I have to make sure I report this within 24 hours of you telling me.

But now I need to report that the event happened last week and that the patient initials were AW and 62-year-old female and the adverse event was blood clot during infusion. And then the company's adverse event group and pharmacovigilance will do all the follow-up.

But it has to be documented there like you have to put it in a drop-down about like date of aware of the event or something like that, I don't know, however you phrase that. But you have to document that because that's not only the metric, but that's just sort of the regulatory requirement on that, that notification within 24 hours.

So that's going to have to be part of whatever you put in on the adverse event side. There is no requirement on that for the medical information side, but like I was saying before, is you probably need the turnaround time, drop down, especially a way to flag urgent requests that are related to direct patient care because those do come in.

And depending on the nature of the drug, might be more common than people might think. A small company that's got a couple of infused products, but infused products always can have issues or concerns with infusion-related reaction. That could come in pretty fast. And the turnaround time might need to be pretty fast, like within an hour or two, depending on that type of situation.

### Tegus Client
Got it. Now turning to not the portal, but the back end, the dashboard and the new requests, any use case gaps that you see there? Any additional fields that should be included or excluded?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
No. Everything looks pretty good on that. I'm just kind of watching it scroll through again off label. I think it some of this is obviously going to be dependent on the company and sort of I guess their needs a little bit because one thing I'm thinking is that it's everybody wants like quick and easy drop downs, especially when it's sort of being metriced.

So it's always this balancing act to say, especially on this dashboard, you can't metric on a lot of these filled-in categories. You have to metric on things. And generally, and my understanding and sort of engaging with med info on this is that there are two big things that they look at, are turnaround time for a response and resource utilization.

### Tegus Client
And by resource utilization, could you dig into that a little more as far as what you're referring to?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
Okay. So say, for instance, you've got the information requests coming in saying, I'm interested in using drug X for patients that are antibody negative, but the indication is for antibody positive patients. So if you have a standard response letter that basically talks about use in antibody-negative patients, the question becomes is, if you're getting that question five times a month versus one time a month versus 20 times a month, there's obviously a sort of back-end awareness of that to say, is this something that we, as a company, should be exploring more from a strategic perspective?

So med info can drive a lot of this sort of strategic thinking and insights gathering based on their resource utilization by certain SRLs depending on the topic, especially the frequency of very specific off-label questions and the use of specific standard response letters. Now the other thing is that's also for resource generation.

So if I'm a med info person, and in the span of three months, I have to create a one-off request that is basically identical five different times, then I'm going to argue that, that resource should be made a standard response letter and not sort of viewed as a one-off response. You need to create a new SRL to address this because the questions come in so frequently.

So that happens quite a bit. So there's a lot of insight that people gather from that. So I think the question becomes in is as you look at the drop-downs, what is sort of reportable out, I guess. And you can report out obviously on text, but that's going to be part of sort of the insight generation function of med info is from this.

### Tegus Client
Got it. So by resource, you weren't necessarily referring to human resources, you were referring to more content that is usable to respond to med info request.

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
Exactly. Now, that's not to say that human resources aren't able to be captured on this because, obviously, you've got a frequency of med info requests coming in and especially if it's sort of documented, are these being sort of fulfilled in a very quick fashion because you're attaching a standard response letter and e-mailing it back versus how many sort of required additional research or things like that, then you could certainly leverage this and say, well, we're getting 500 med info requests a month.

I've got one person. They're doing the turnaround. But to be honest with you, turnaround, even if requested in two to three days is actually closer to three to five days, then that's an argument to be made that you need additional head count.

So there's a lot of back-end work because you've got the request and then sort of the dynamic of how long does it take to fulfill the request. So that's probably the reportable aspect of it is not necessarily a field, the reporting out on a field, but sort of reporting on the opening and closing of the actual request itself.

### Tegus Client
Got you. I know we've talked about standard response letters a lot during this conversation. Is there some kind of review and approval process that those SRLs need to go through before that content can be shared with HCPs or others?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
Absolutely. So it generally has to go through medical review committees, MRCs for their use because it is considered a medical document in the sense of like a slide deck or things like that. So anything that would have an external audience would have to get approved. The content would have to be approved by the MRC Committee.

And most times, the material in the letter is good for a year following approval. So it depends. Sometimes that's by company policy, sometimes is by regulatory affairs. I know you can sometimes get two years out of things. But a lot of things are sort of viewed on an annual basis. Now there's a whole other infrastructure. I know Veeva Vault and some of these other things that sort of tries to align the management of the documents.

So this isn't necessarily sort of an integrated document storage capability, at least as far as I can tell from this. I'm looking at it where it says response document and they open up the download or where it's going to go, you're going to have to pull it from the most current version.

And those things are going to have to be, again, updated. And lots of times, you see these type of dashboards and these type of metrics drive the conversation about how frequently should these things be updated? So oftentimes, you say you get, like, for instance, a use in antibody-negative patients when your indication is antibody positive.

Well, you may have a standard response letter that depending on how often it's getting sent out and the interest in it, you may say, let's flag this for an every six-month review and see if there's any new literature in six months to add to the SRL because we're getting this question so frequently.

So that's where it can also drive that sort of resource utilization, the content resource utilization on that side of things. But yes, the SRLs do have to be approved and have to be updated. And again, it's also what else they send out. So SRLs and slide decks are the two most common things, but all of those have expiration dates, unless they're renewed by the medical review committee.

### Tegus Client
And one more follow-up on that review and approval. So if it was felt that there was a need for a new SRL that needed review and approval would it make sense to have that kind of process initiated from this MIR application where a draft SRL could be input and then a workflow could be kicked off and sent to the members of the medical review committee to review and approve this. And then if it's approved, then it kind of automatically gets captured and saved in the library is potential SRL for distribution?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
Yes. I mean, I think that's definitely a nice way to organize this because I've seen SRLs float in several different sort of back-end systems. But I think the best ones are always where you have better version control. There are ways to do that with folders and things in the desktop.

But in my opinion, it's always better and reduces error if the front-end system is pulling the document from sort of a protected location that is always kept current and up to date. And then again, within the system, the genesis of a new SRL could certainly be done.

It's probably outside of the scope of this particular dashboard because it's probably more of a content creation workflow. But it has the beginnings of this from that dashboard where you're going to start to see the trends really easily.

And when you review those dashboards and those trends, you're going to see from pretty clearly like, okay, this SRL is high usage, we should flag it for a review in six months. But I think the back-end library, document library, document storage would probably have to encompass pretty robust version control, robust templating and basically a pretty good sort of approval routing.

So if somebody goes in and med info types up or copies and pays in a bunch of new information, saves the document in the back-end library and basically says, okay, the next step is the medical review committee. So it's going to go to these five people and then the workflow, it gets pushed out to them for review.

And most of the time, they'll meet as a committee and sort of review it in person or over Zoom or whatever. And then their edits and changes are in the back-end system. Those are acted on by either med info or somebody on sort of the field medical team depending on the size of the company, that sort of is responsible for that.

And then when the final version is done and approved, it fits in that back-end library with sort of an approval date and a date for review. And then hopefully, the system is set up so that it basically sends you a reminder says, hey, SRL on antibody-negative patients will come up for renewal in three months. Would you like to edit now or something like that because it can take weeks to months depending on the length and content of some of these SRLs and some of these other documents.

Great. Can you ballpark like what do you think a solution like this would be worth to you, assuming that did all the back-end things that you would need? Or just to somebody in medical affairs?

I think you're looking at a very valuable resource. I've seen it from both perspectives of sort of an all-in-one integration, CRM to med info, which has its challenges at times, but does provide sort of a cohesive experience.

But if I'm understanding correctly, and this is a product being leveraged towards a small or a midsized company that is resource constrained and is doing these requests sort of manually, I think this can be a real benefit.

And I think to be honest with you, it's an argument about sort of human resources there because manually, you might need three people sort of checking an e-mail and manually responding, manually looking for things and like attaching SRLs from a file folder and doing all of this.

But this has taken out a lot of the front-end busy work in essence. So I mean, from a resource utilization standpoint, from human resources, you might actually be able to kind of do more with less in terms of the med info headcount. So I think that would be good.

I think the other thing is that a lot of this boils down to sort of regulatory and compliance, what it's basically selling in some respect is safety and security on their processes to be compliant and auditable. And med info is not immune to getting this sort of scrutiny. Maybe even more so in some ways because they're handling all these off-label questions.

And this system, I think, gives you a little bit of standardization about how the process happens so that you are maybe a little bit more protected as a company from, I don't think anybody would do this maliciously, but basically poorly trained or first-time people, you've given them a system that's very easy to learn.

And to kind of make it full proof that they can't sort of go off the regulatory range in a reply or a response or a manner of engaging them. But I think that goes to my earlier comments about the documenting of the physician actually making the request, the time.

Some of these things are sort of regulatory components that if you can sort of put that in the system and make it centralized, then say med info gets audited. Well, you know what, they can pull up a listing from the system and basically say, well, here's all the med info requests we've gotten.

Here's how many were actually off-label. Here's how many adverse events were reported in this system. And look, every single adverse event was documented within 24 hours of the person notifying us of being made aware. So that's the value there.

But again, I think the question is that how well does this play with other systems that they may be utilizing? Med info and CRM can be separate, but when they are linked, there are some things that help out, for instance, I can see within Veeva, if a med info request has been submitted for a particular KOL.

Now this system, at least as far as I can tell, has the dashboard that is probably accessible to the med info person. But as I was saying earlier, the question is how is this sort of overall process being made transparent to the MSL or the field medical because nothing about this is kicking back into a CRM potentially.

And so unless the MSL is sort of getting copied, CCed on the response, they're not going to know that KOL there has put in a question. And then again, the regulatory side of this is a little fuzzy to me. But they've made it a very clear point that commercial has to basically ask and get a verbal affirmation of whether or not they want MSL follow-up. So that is always a challenge because when they say no, then there's an argument to be made, well, they said no, they don't want MSL follow-up.

I disagree. I should know about it, but I'm not going to use it to go be like, hey, doctor, I heard you had a question about this, even though you explicitly said you didn't want MSL follow-up. But next time I go talk to that KOL, it may make its way into my conversation about issues or challenges that they've had. So I think there's some stuff there that I think, again, the transparency to all the different elements that maybe touch this or get feedback from it is important.

### Tegus Client
Okay. I think that a lot of the challenges here align really well with looking at the low code platform and the advantages that it brings and being able to be flexible and reliable with different processes in highly regulated industries.

A big part of the business is actually in federal agencies, for instance, as well as pharma. So I do think making that ROI pitch there makes a lot of sense. And making sure there's the ability to connect this back into whatever CRM they're using for their MSLs, that's kind of just a foundational thing too. Am I correct on that?

### Senior Medical Science Liaison at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc
Yes. And I said the CRM integration is maybe a nice to have. But I think the bigger thing that would benefit this platform as a stand-alone product is sort of that back-end library functionality where the document storage and sort of management can happen.

Because I can tell you that from a time-saving perspective, if you think about the MI request, there's obviously their front-end direct customer facing kind of responsibilities, but there's all their back-end work on making these SRLs, making sure they're up to date, finding or doing literature searches for one-off request.

So that's the other part of the value that there might be to this as you think about like sort of a modular approach to it is how do you sort of make this document creation, document management portion that this system basically pulls from easier for med info.

And I think that, in and of itself, it would be a huge win, and that can only add value to the overall process. Now you may be stepping on more kind of a CRM functionality in some respects. But I can tell you, not everybody that has Veeva has Veeva Vault or has this as a methodology. In fact, we don't.

We were just lamenting that a little bit ago that we don't actually have Veeva Vault, a lot of our things are still pulled from a box folder or a SharePoint or something like that, and making sure that it's the right version, that I'm pulling from the right version.

And we'll get e-mails from our medical information and med communication colleagues saying, if you downloaded another version, make sure you delete it and use this version. So yes, but anything that sort of can prevent some mistakes like that from happening or sort of having incorrect or out-of-date version is very important. And med info really is the holder of a lot of that information, especially from the SRL and the slide deck perspective about what they're sending out and when the time frames that they can send that out are.

Sounds great. That was very helpful and insightful. So thanks again.
