## Problem

**Pharma spends $100M+ across the lifecycle of a drug to create content but generates half the ROI of other industries**

Pharma marketing is controlled by agencies, leading to expensive, slow, and bland content development.

**It takes ~18-24 months to launch a brand campaign, 75% of which is due to content development and approval.**

### Content Development Workflow:
1. **Scientific content & message strategy** - Reviewing hundreds of clinical papers
2. **Initial content development & drafts** - Content created and reviewed by 15-20 medical experts
3. **Multiple rounds of agency, brand, & medical review** - Multiple rounds of repeated review due to regulatory misalignment
4. **Medical-Legal-Regulatory Review** - Only one MLR cycle per week & resource constraints
5. **Asset Production & Deployment** - Recreating a production-ready asset in HTML

## Case Study: Alexion

**How Alexion scaled Solstice from a pilot to across a brand within a quarter**

Alexion received FDA approval to treat generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) for their drug ULTOMIRIS in 2022, quickly becoming the market leader.

Due to their parent company's (AstraZeneca) mandates and cost constraints, the marketing team was forced to use Indegene, a BPO for all derivative content.

Quality was abysmal - taking 3 MLR cycles on average for content approval. A single line update to an email could take a month.

### With Solstice:
- Launched an entirely new **"Early Vax"** campaign with banners, emails and brochures within a month
- Replaced Indegene's entire team with a **single engagement lead** and Solstice's platform will increasing content velocity and MLR approval rates

### Impact:
- **2.5x** Increase of Volume of new content produced
- Expanded Solstice across the entire **gMG** indication and to **NMOSD** as well

> "We are going to be the most efficient brand team in the US, thanks to Solstice."
> — Kristine Saffrin, Associate Director, US Patient Marketing

## Case Study: Phathom Pharmaceuticals

**How Phathom Pharmaceuticals Replaced Omnicom with Solstice**

Phathom launched their only asset, VOQUEZNA, in late 2023.

Their agency of record, charges them millions a year but the core campaign elements have already been made.

Most remaining work is executional to rework content and reframe positioning.

Given cost constraints, Phathom only creates content when absolutely needed. As a result, they have poor HCP awareness.

### With Solstice:
- Solstice has powered creation of digital assets including HCP emails, banner ads, and social content **across multiple channels**
- Solstice enabled Phathom to systematically update affected content across their entire asset library during an FDA label update, saving the organization **$500,000**

### Impact:
- **$2m** Agency cost saving within first 3 months
- Time from inception to MLR approval went from 2 months → **less than 2 weeks**

> "It's like freaking amazing that that platform understands everything we do and talks our language, like amazing."
> — Leona Ling, Senior Director of Marketing
