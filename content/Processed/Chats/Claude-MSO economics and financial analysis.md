## MSO Research Summary: Economics & Financials Across Specialties

### **What I Found**

I've pulled several key PDF documents and research materials on MSO economics:

**Key PDFs Retrieved:**

1. **Maryland PE/MSO Report (January 2025)** - Comprehensive state-level analysis of PE penetration in physician practices with specialty-by-specialty data
2. **McGuireWoods Private Equity in Healthcare Report (August 2023)** - 27-specialty breakdown with investment outlook
3. **APG California MSO Whitepaper** - Operational economics and compliance frameworks for independent MSOs

---

### **The "So What" for Healthcare VCs**

#### **1. MSO Economics 101: Where the Money Flows**

The MSO-PC (Professional Corporation) model exists because of Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM) laws in most states. The management fee typically draws out all revenue of the practice other than clinical provider compensation. This creates a clean arbitrage:

**Management Fee Structures:**
- Percentage of revenue (e.g. 20% of practice revenue)
- Fixed fee (e.g. $200,000 annually)
- Cost plus mark-up

MSOs are typically paid 4-12% of collected revenue, aligning success with the financial performance of the medical group.

**Investment Implication:** The real economics aren't in the management fee—they're in the MSO's ability to create "synthetic EBITDA" by professionalizing operations and driving economies of scale across a platform.

---

#### **2. Specialty-Specific PE Penetration & Economics**

From the Maryland data (which shows above-national-average penetration), here's the investment landscape by specialty as of 2021:

| Specialty | PE Penetration (MD) | Investment Thesis |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Urology | 63.3% | Highly consolidated, late-stage |
| Dermatology | 36.2% | Early PE target, mature platforms |
| Primary Care | 27.3% | Value-based care tailwind |
| Ophthalmology | 25.2% | ASC + retail ancillaries |
| Gastroenterology | 16.7% | Strong ancillary margins |
| Cardiology | 14.5% | High growth, outpatient migration |
| Orthopedics | 8.8% | "PE 3.0" model, profit-share |
| Oncology | 8.4% | Complex reimbursement |

PE expansion is geographically uneven, with certain counties like Prince George's County experiencing 53.2% penetration while rural counties had none.

---

#### **3. Valuation Multiples by Specialty**

Current market data (2024-2025):

- The median EBITDA multiple is 13.0x from 33 transactions over the 2-year period from May 2022 through May 2024.
- For smaller add-on acquisitions, EBITDA multiples typically range from 6.0x to 9.0x. Larger platform acquisitions command higher multiples.
- Due to the high-cost debt environment, private transaction multiples have decreased by one to two-plus turns of EBITDA.

**Key insight:** Not all EBITDA is evaluated equally. Key value drivers include size and scale, clinical reputation, level of professionalization of the MSO, historical and prospective growth, and pipeline of M&A opportunities.

---

#### **4. The Evolution: PE 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0**

Where specialties like Dental, Dermatology, and Eye Care continue to utilize a percentage of collections compensation model, the 3.0 model follows a profit share model that keeps the old shareholder compensation formula in-place, while allowing shareholders to participate in growth of local level profits.

This matters because orthopedics and cardiology are seeing much better physician alignment than legacy models—creating stickier platforms with better retention.

---

#### **5. Price Impact Data (The Regulatory Risk)**

PE acquisitions raised prices by 11% in dermatology, gastroenterology, and ophthalmology, while neonatology prices surged by 70%. A study on gastroenterology practices found PE acquisitions led to a 28.4% increase in claim prices, primarily driven by a 78.1% rise in professional fees.

**So what:** This is fueling regulatory scrutiny. Multiple states are implementing transaction review requirements. California nearly passed legislation to regulate PE investment in 2024 (vetoed by governor).

---

#### **6. MSO Value Creation Levers**

From the research, successful MSOs drive value through:

1. **Economies of Scale:** Centralization of administrative functions creates economy of scale on a per member, per month (PMPM) basis.

2. **Ancillary Services:** ASCs, labs, imaging, pathology, DME—these are the margin drivers

3. **Network Expansion:** MSOs aggregate volumes and hence are able to achieve economies of scale, obtaining preferred pricing on medical supplies, healthcare insurance, etc.

4. **Value-Based Care Readiness:** PE-affiliated physicians had higher participation rates in Maryland value-based programs such as MDPCP, with 37.7% of PE-affiliated primary care physicians participating versus 24.6% of non-PE physicians.

---

#### **7. Current Investment Outlook by Specialty**

From McGuireWoods' assessment:

| **MORE Interest** | **STEADY Interest** | **LESS Interest** |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Aesthetics/Med Spa | Ambulatory Surgery Centers | Dental |
| Behavioral Health | Anesthesia/Pain Mgmt | Dermatology |
| Cardiology | Gastroenterology | Hospital-Based/EM |
| Pharma Services | Orthopedics | Vision Care |
| Primary Care | Urology | |
| Women's Health | Podiatry | |

The Healthcare MSO Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% by 2030.

---

### **Bottom Line for Your Investment Thesis**

1. **Where to play:** Cardiology and behavioral health are the current "hot" spaces with favorable tailwinds and early-stage consolidation

2. **Watch out for:** Regulatory risk is real—the Milbank Memorial Fund and others are pushing for MSO transparency requirements and strengthened CPOM enforcement

3. **Due diligence priority:** Management fee structures must be defensible at FMV; the cost-plus method is safest from a compliance perspective

4. **The margin is in ancillaries:** ASCs, imaging, labs are where platforms create real economic value beyond the management fee

5. **PE 3.0 models win:** Profit-share structures with local participation outperform older "percentage of collections" models on physician retention

Would you like me to pull any additional data on specific specialties, create a deeper dive on ancillary economics, or search for any particular MSO platforms?

## Neurology MSO Economics: The "So What"

**Stage of Consolidation: Very Early / White Space**

Unlike dermatology (36% PE penetration in MD), gastroenterology (17%), or urology (63%), neurology remains highly fragmented with most practices comprising 1–3 physicians. Unlike cardiology, dermatology, or GI, there is no scaled PE-backed national platform. This is the "first wave" opportunity investors look for.

**Why It's Attractive Now**

1. **Massive demand tailwinds:** Neurologist shortages, aging demographics, and rising chronic neurological diseases are driving sustained volume growth. There's a projected 19% shortfall of neurologists this year, with wait times exceeding 2 months.

2. **Ancillary revenue is the margin play** (sound familiar from our earlier discussion):
   - **Infusion centers** – MS biologics, migraine treatments (Vyepti, Ajovy), IVIG for neuropathies. Neurology patients with MS, migraines, and autoimmune conditions often require biologic infusions. ROI is very strong but capital-intensive. The neurology infusion therapy market is growing at ~8% annually through 2030.
   - **EMG/Nerve Conduction Studies** – It is common for those neurologists interpreting EEGs or EMGs full-time to generate 50%–75% more work RVUs per unit of time than a neurologist performing E&M services.
   - **Sleep labs** – Strong reimbursement, recurring revenue
   - **EEG monitoring** – Both routine and ambulatory
   - **In-office imaging** – MRI is critical for MS monitoring

3. **Proven adjacency playbook:** Oncology, rheumatology, and pain management have delivered strong sponsor returns with similar clinical and ancillary characteristics. Neurology offers a similar but untapped path.

**The Economic Model**

In these deals, the private equity firm creates a friendly physician professional corporation (PC) model where only one physician is a shareholder in the PC and is employed by the management company. The typical structure:
- Platform acquisition at high single-digit EBITDA multiples
- Most private equity firms will keep 40% of that amount to fund the newly created MSO that will be the platform to drive success. The 40% invested in the MSO is afforded by the practice neurosurgeons as equity in the new management company.

**Current Deal Activity**

While 15+ practices have transacted in the past five years, activity has been infusion-focused or small in scale. Key buyers include:
- **InTandem Capital Partners** (Vivo Infusion platform) – acquiring neurology practices in TX, MI
- **NexPhase Capital** (Clearway Pain Solutions) – expanding into neurodiagnostics
- **Health system roll-ups** – Tufts, Ascension acquiring neurology groups

The largest independent neurology practice—**First Choice Neurology** in Florida (90+ neurologists, 60+ locations)—is the largest private practice, physician-owned neurology group in the United States and has explicitly resisted PE, building scale organically with integrated MRI, sleep, infusion, and research centers.

**Key Risks / Diligence Items**

1. **Physician shortage is a double-edged sword** – Demand is there, but recruiting is brutal
2. **Reimbursement complexity** – 35% of neurology claims face initial denials due to coding issues (EMG/EEG billing is notoriously complex)
3. **Infusion economics can swing quickly** – Drug acquisition costs, prior auth burden, 340B eligibility all matter
4. **No proof-of-concept at scale yet** – You'd be building the first true platform

**Bottom Line for a Healthcare VC**

Neurology checks the boxes: fragmented market, aging population tailwinds, rich ancillary mix, proven playbook from adjacencies. Existing PE-backed infusion platforms are pursuing neurology practices to expand patient access and diversify revenue. Integrated, multi-modality groups offering infusion, imaging, EEG, and diagnostics present a compelling consolidation thesis.

The "so what": This is a **first-mover opportunity** with genuine white space, but requires patience and operational sophistication. The winner here will likely be whoever can crack the physician recruitment/retention model while building out infusion as the margin anchor.

Thought process: Thinking about integrating Notion content on autonomy concepts.

The user wants me to search their Notion workspace for information about "autonomy" to add context to the neurology MSO discussion. This is likely related to physician autonomy in the context of PE-backed MSOs, which is a key consideration in these deals.

Neurology is a space that has been ignored by MSOs over the past decade, but the growth of the neurology drug market has provided an opportunity for Autonomy to partner with neurologists to drive revenue through in-office infusions and be a first-mover in the \\$100B+ neurology drug market.\nAutonomy partners with independent neurologists to provide RCM tools and technology infrastructure in a MSO model to launch profitable ancillaries in their clinics to drive more revenue and keep patients from being referred out to expensive health systems. The MSO playbook has been employed by private equity in different specialties (Dermatology, Rheumatology, Ophthalmology, Oncology, Urology, etc) over the last decade, but neurology is largely untouched and highly fragmented with \\>10K independent neurologists across the country. Fundamentally, [MSOs are not a new model and have been around since the 1990’s]({{https://www.lek.com/sites/default/files/insights/pdf-attachments/LEK_Physicial_Practice_Management_A_New_Chapter.pdf}}), and we have seen specific characteristics that enable long-term, durable success with this model.\nAutonomy and the neurology market have all these characteristics - high fragmentation, ability to 2x physician take-home pay, potential to drive meaningful cost-savings for payers, and network effects at scale (payer contracting + drug purchasing). Autonomy today is live or under LOI / in contracting with 4 clinics representing \\$600–700K of potential MSO revenue (6-10% take-rate initially). To-date, Autonomy has chosen to buy off-the-shelf software because they are solely focused on distribution - for initial learnings, scale for drug purchasing, and network effects with payers.\nRooshil and Natalie have known each other since 2016 when they initially worked together at Morgan Stanley and again later at AF Ventures. Rooshil initially courted Natalie as an advisor while he was iterating on Autonomy and ultimately Natalie was convinced to join full-time as a co-founder. In today’s hyper paced fundraising environment, we deeply value those teams who invest crucial time & energy to methodically iterate and pressure test their proposed value proposition with prospective customers prior to raising venture funding. Rooshil and Natalie can leverage known execution playbooks and use their first-mover advantage to build a \\$100M business in only 2 or 3 states in capital efficient MSO model (low CapEx, favorable working capital dynamics).\n***We are excited to lead a \\$2.5M round at a \\$13.5M post-money valuation with a \\$1.35M investment (10% effective ownership) to grow to 15+ neurology clinics, develop internal product capabilities (prior auth, contracting, etc), and show early signals of network effects (payer contracting + drug pricing) that can enable true scale in the next round. ***\n### **Team **\n<image source=\"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9652a084-ee9f-44b9-84d4-7ccbc428692b/38eb39be-6790-41bc-b088-0553de08eb82/Screenshot_2025-05-20_at_8.28.21_AM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466RE4VF72K%2F20251216%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251216T125108Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIA%2BQQQO3RLmK2NCxNgsgADf3xy1to54nBzrbnFmoYoQhAiAUHBw2DAsV%2FHzy0BoifU%2BsuUJu6cen7V%2BopQQiWF3BtCr%2FAwhlEAAaDDYzNzQyMzE4MzgwNSIM%2BSDcY3LJ96wZ3E5GKtwD%2BCgQKvJSzqJZB6KX9TM0NJmtDrSNNM1LMAMJXiGRM3iVuLrpAClj6wuFOmQ48wFHzzDVhbq4lnTRmYereZs4Mez%2FCw7eCKN%2BzQzvpkCBGHGKmVfIkmkY19JSwEzuF4WGonnsYwyhT30IQRiTlE4vBUIvHxJAJ5ZyB7CNrUX6WJPZ9q14duIIwWWKUBfX%2FdnrCj%2BAJMkL52xJphYSFq8EH5Q2ny37TxSQVSp%2FF22ws8t9zgH%2FsaeUapnRLWl7GnYmgrFK21cyWtRp%2FaHmxzF9YB5p5na2VB3I6v7qXzz4OTJCQfjY6GbkXNnFJq1OIJnjkfFrAkKxqlTkDR%2FLpFvAI%2Bk4fmZJTO%2F9lPupNeDrKXYKYS7%2FTt%2BlZTs3hlw8RvKc4EbMfLsh1RHfCN250EOYwSL55tR6b%2BByQB6aJ3sqkFecNFhe54XIFbPpk2u58uHwuzZWjuvtrz92YhQdMjaU9qMni5ao1WL3Oz8cR3236OnobwOClzn67JQGUAuH5cLyk82QjVq6uxsL%2FAY2xghKe7JQr6DA6DMudDec09ylxK6kpeeGRh1tYgSvlCffNsom8k9jb9gQwDe3WMs8hFkCoajWU3po0riKR0XHrKO8%2Fe0ahPq7sd0bWR6nF4QwgpmFygY6pgHBDYCFkbC1yxmMtdp1c9BS4yf%2Fbewoobiiruau2A%2FWhSSjnYMcOq7O2ZXvRi%2BtijXT1ELtMqvWOb2QxS4KwkblBS9DCfkD3LV1D71r4RKxH1t0s7Er1Zu2aZn%2FHKaeVi0bUTzVT9zCBMpF6gr1X%2B8%2BeC8HSgmby0i8NZzVaLA0qvDl3IiKGptflxZr7sVKFv0zGj9Z7ePvkEaXMFc4vXrEvwHhZ8mf&X-Amz-Signature=7f3a50741d84d882c5716ae3c1ed0677fe0c07386861c6634ebb0ae0bde2c8bb&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\"></image>\n[Rooshil Shah]({{https://www.linkedin.com/in/rooshilshah/}}) (CEO) and [Natalie Curnes]({{https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-curnes-92844597/}}) (co-founder) first met during their time at Morgan Stanley in 2016 and have stayed close ever since. When Rooshil called Natalie in late 2023 and shared the early vision for Autonomy Health, Natalie was only planning on providing advice to a friend. Over time, the potential market opportunity and, more importantly, the opportunity to work with Rooshil convinced her to join full-time.\nWhile it comes natural to Rooshil and Natalie, the process over 2024 and early 2025 to iterate on the exact solution by working with neurologists, pivoting the exact product wedge, and learning the nuances of the specialty pharmacy space in neurology have laid a foundation for real GTM speed and sophistication. These 2 could have raised a similarly competitive round (current round oversubscribed with only angels in 2 days) with no traction and a slide deck. Virtue is the only institutional venture firm in this initial angel round.\nWe think about founder-market fit at the early-stage just as much as we think about product-market fit as the business evolves. The MSO space has tried and true playbooks from other specialties and is ultimately a game of execution won on distribution.

Importantly, the long list of pipeline drugs in areas like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and ALS are a cherry on top for Autonomy’s growth over time. The Alzheimer’s market alone is projecting \\$11B+ in global sales by 2030 but we are viewing this as further upside given the slower commercial ramp in the Alzheimer’s space over the last 2-3 years.\n**Competition **\nThere are no scaled MSO players in neurology today, which represents massive opportunity for Autonomy to scale and be a leader in the context of the rapidly growing drug market. We break down the competitive landscape into 3 buckets\n- **Multi-specialty MSOs that have neuro service lines.** Companies like [Triarq Health ]({{https://triarqhealth.com/blog/why-neurologists-should-partner-with-a-management-services-organization}})or [SCALE Healthcare]({{https://www.scale-healthcare.com/scale-neurology/}}) are essentially consulting services that provide bespoke services to practices across a number of different specialties. They provide claims data analysis, help with vendor selection, and do not develop their own technology. Autonomy can build a durable tech advantage against these players.\n- **Neuro Platforms for M&A**. [Nira Medical]({{https://www.niramedical.com/}}) is the main PE/VC-backed platform (SilverSmith and Transformation Capital) acquiring and rolling up neurology clinics. They are partnered with 4 clinics in Colorado (2), FL (1), and TX (1) with \\~50 neurologists. We estimate based on these numbers they are doing \\$30M+ in net collections with \\~20% EBITDA margins. Autonomy provides an offering where Neurologists can still control their clinic and how they practice medicine while also driving more revenue - a win-win.\n- **Broader platforms that have neuro offering. **Wholesalers like McKesson provide services like [IntraFusion]({{https://www.mckesson.com/specialty/full-service-practice-management/infusion-management/}}) that provide full turn-key build out and day-to-day management of in-office suites. OI Infusion provides white-label suite inside the practice and OI retains staff and bills the global fee on behalf of the physician. We’ve talked to leaders at McKesson in conversations across multiple specialties, and like many big companies, they fail to tailor their solutions to a specific provider end market. There’s a reason why specialty-specific GPOs/MSOs have scaled rapidly in other specialties (rheumatology, oncology, urology, etc) to fill this gap. We’ve also spoken to OI infusion’s former [Chief Growth Officer]({{https://www.linkedin.com/in/idara-umoh/}}) and OI’s lack of focus in a particular speciality or strategy (AIC vs. in-office infusions) limits uptake across provides. Autonomy can compete with these players with their exclusive focus on neurology.\n### Favorable Characteristics for MSO Model\nFundamentally, we view different models in our care delivery bucket (virtual, hybrid, MSO, brick-and-mortar clinics) as different options to capture value (and therefore margin) that should be tailored to each specific specialty. A fully virtual model can have less initial CapEx but may have higher customer acquisition costs. In some areas (e.g., Autism), the CapEx, payback periods, and cash flow dynamics are attractive for a 4-wall business to capture the full margin of high LTV patients. In neurology, the market characteristics make it ripe for an MSO model (described below).\n<image source=\"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9652a084-ee9f-44b9-84d4-7ccbc428692b/7f132187-03f2-460e-8d6b-3bcab12caf48/Screenshot_2025-05-15_at_11.40.37_AM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466RE4VF72K%2F20251216%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251216T125108Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIA%2BQQQO3RLmK2NCxNgsgADf3xy1to54nBzrbnFmoYoQhAiAUHBw2DAsV%2FHzy0BoifU%2BsuUJu6cen7V%2BopQQiWF3BtCr%2FAwhlEAAaDDYzNzQyMzE4MzgwNSIM%2BSDcY3LJ96wZ3E5GKtwD%2BCgQKvJSzqJZB6KX9TM0NJmtDrSNNM1LMAMJXiGRM3iVuLrpAClj6wuFOmQ48wFHzzDVhbq4lnTRmYereZs4Mez%2FCw7eCKN%2BzQzvpkCBGHGKmVfIkmkY19JSwEzuF4WGonnsYwyhT30IQRiTlE4vBUIvHxJAJ5ZyB7CNrUX6WJPZ9q14duIIwWWKUBfX%2FdnrCj%2BAJMkL52xJphYSFq8EH5Q2ny37TxSQVSp%2FF22ws8t9zgH%2FsaeUapnRLWl7GnYmgrFK21cyWtRp%2FaHmxzF9YB5p5na2VB3I6v7qXzz4OTJCQfjY6GbkXNnFJq1OIJnjkfFrAkKxqlTkDR%2FLpFvAI%2Bk4fmZJTO%2F9lPupNeDrKXYKYS7%2FTt%2BlZTs3hlw8RvKc4EbMfLsh1RHfCN250EOYwSL55tR6b%2BByQB6aJ3sqkFecNFhe54XIFbPpk2u58uHwuzZWjuvtrz92YhQdMjaU9qMni5ao1WL3Oz8cR3236OnobwOClzn67JQGUAuH5cLyk82QjVq6uxsL%2FAY2xghKe7JQr6DA6DMudDec09ylxK6kpeeGRh1tYgSvlCffNsom8k9jb9gQwDe3WMs8hFkCoajWU3po0riKR0XHrKO8%2Fe0ahPq7sd0bWR6nF4QwgpmFygY6pgHBDYCFkbC1yxmMtdp1c9BS4yf%2Fbewoobiiruau2A%2FWhSSjnYMcOq7O2ZXvRi%2BtijXT1ELtMqvWOb2QxS4KwkblBS9DCfkD3LV1D71r4RKxH1t0s7Er1Zu2aZn%2FHKaeVi0bUTzVT9zCBMpF6gr1X%2B8%2BeC8HSgmby0i8NZzVaLA0qvDl3IiKGptflxZr7sVKFv0zGj9Z7ePvkEaXMFc4vXrEvwHhZ8mf&X-Amz-Signature=2f848ffb5207673a2ce9cfa69936c304a4b949c49b757ad18348a1272b76341a&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\">[https://www.antitrustinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AAI-UCB-EG_Private-Equity-I-Physician-Practice-Report_FINAL.pdf]({{https://www.antitrustinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AAI-UCB-EG_Private-Equity-I-Physician-Practice-Report_FINAL.pdf}})</image>\nMSOs are not a new model, and private equity has been rolling up clinics in other specialties over the last decade.

We have seen pitches MSOs (partnering with existing practices) or business in a box models (help providers start their own practices) in almost every specialty over the last 3-4 years. The dynamics that make a specialty or condition area ripe for an MSO model include:\n- High enough provider *‘N’*\n- Fragmented market, low PE activity and no dominant incumbent “platform”\n- Ability to add new service lines to increase physician take home pay\n- Ability to add Advanced Practice Practitioners (APPs) to create operating leverage\n- Regulatory tailwinds\n- Low reliance on value based care (VBC) reimbursement\n- Low to medium CapEx needs for de novo practices\n- Certain minimum degree of operational difficulty that would necessitate a partner\n- Significant differential between clinician compensation in hospital vs private practice\n- Low value capture in a hospital relative to average charges (i.e. comp vs billed charges)\n<image source=\"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9652a084-ee9f-44b9-84d4-7ccbc428692b/d0203ee4-952b-4da2-aae2-ec8932e0a446/Screenshot_2025-05-20_at_9.41.34_AM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466RE4VF72K%2F20251216%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251216T125108Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIA%2BQQQO3RLmK2NCxNgsgADf3xy1to54nBzrbnFmoYoQhAiAUHBw2DAsV%2FHzy0BoifU%2BsuUJu6cen7V%2BopQQiWF3BtCr%2FAwhlEAAaDDYzNzQyMzE4MzgwNSIM%2BSDcY3LJ96wZ3E5GKtwD%2BCgQKvJSzqJZB6KX9TM0NJmtDrSNNM1LMAMJXiGRM3iVuLrpAClj6wuFOmQ48wFHzzDVhbq4lnTRmYereZs4Mez%2FCw7eCKN%2BzQzvpkCBGHGKmVfIkmkY19JSwEzuF4WGonnsYwyhT30IQRiTlE4vBUIvHxJAJ5ZyB7CNrUX6WJPZ9q14duIIwWWKUBfX%2FdnrCj%2BAJMkL52xJphYSFq8EH5Q2ny37TxSQVSp%2FF22ws8t9zgH%2FsaeUapnRLWl7GnYmgrFK21cyWtRp%2FaHmxzF9YB5p5na2VB3I6v7qXzz4OTJCQfjY6GbkXNnFJq1OIJnjkfFrAkKxqlTkDR%2FLpFvAI%2Bk4fmZJTO%2F9lPupNeDrKXYKYS7%2FTt%2BlZTs3hlw8RvKc4EbMfLsh1RHfCN250EOYwSL55tR6b%2BByQB6aJ3sqkFecNFhe54XIFbPpk2u58uHwuzZWjuvtrz92YhQdMjaU9qMni5ao1WL3Oz8cR3236OnobwOClzn67JQGUAuH5cLyk82QjVq6uxsL%2FAY2xghKe7JQr6DA6DMudDec09ylxK6kpeeGRh1tYgSvlCffNsom8k9jb9gQwDe3WMs8hFkCoajWU3po0riKR0XHrKO8%2Fe0ahPq7sd0bWR6nF4QwgpmFygY6pgHBDYCFkbC1yxmMtdp1c9BS4yf%2Fbewoobiiruau2A%2FWhSSjnYMcOq7O2ZXvRi%2BtijXT1ELtMqvWOb2QxS4KwkblBS9DCfkD3LV1D71r4RKxH1t0s7Er1Zu2aZn%2FHKaeVi0bUTzVT9zCBMpF6gr1X%2B8%2BeC8HSgmby0i8NZzVaLA0qvDl3IiKGptflxZr7sVKFv0zGj9Z7ePvkEaXMFc4vXrEvwHhZ8mf&X-Amz-Signature=53960ac23002da761b782f5194f3089af43496b01bd11b98a298d035aa07089a&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\"></image>\nIf we simplify it for Autonomy, the 3 biggest factors driving our excitement and interest in this model in neurology are\n- **Increase in provider comp. **As seen in the model below, adding infusions and injectables can 2X a provider’s comp. This is far beyond what we see in other MSO models (Finni for BCBAs, Headway/Grow for Mental Health, Chamber for Cardiology, Nourish/Fay for dietitians) that typically hover around 10-20%. We typically like models that are revenue generating vs. cost-savings, but this model directly leads to increased physician compensation, not just revenue to the organization or practice. This is the top of the hierarchy of hard dollar ROI.\n- **Beneficial to payers at scale. **The playbook for typical PE-backed MSOs is to consolidate supply of providers in a region and then negotiate higher rates with payers, essentially holding payers hostage with their negotiating leverage.** **We’ve seen this dynamic play out with Headway and the other mental health MSOs in 2024 and 2025 as these companies contracts come up for renewal - payers are reimbursing Headway providers at higher rates without seeing decreases in cost and are now looking to renegotiate. For Autonomy, in comparison, payers want to move infusions out of hospital outpatient departments (HOPD) where infusions are 3-4x the cost of in-office administration. It’s a rare win-win for providers (increase comp) and payers (decrease costs).\n- **Network effects. **When Autonomy reaches scale in a specific state or MSA, network effects kick in where Autonomy can negotiate more favorable deals with payers to account for the cost savings that Autonomy is driving, and, just as importantly, hit the volume required to negotiate discounts or rebates on drugs they are purchasing for their practices.\nWhile other ancillaries (imaging, dementia care with GUIDE model are attractive), additional revenue from infusions is the major driving factor. As shown below, adding infusions to a neurology clinic can unlock upwards of 2X physician comp in a typical neurologist clinic, even when incorporating increased OpEx to support infusions (e.g., infusion nurse, infusion suite).\n<image source=\"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9652a084-ee9f-44b9-84d4-7ccbc428692b/ab6a20d1-eaa1-4aba-9f19-e78932cf4e8f/63091b22-686b-4b5d-906c-50a4465565ee.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466RE4VF72K%2F20251216%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251216T125108Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIA%2BQQQO3RLmK2NCxNgsgADf3xy1to54nBzrbnFmoYoQhAiAUHBw2DAsV%2FHzy0BoifU%2BsuUJu6cen7V%2BopQQiWF3BtCr%2FAwhlEAAaDDYzNzQyMzE4MzgwNSIM%2BSDcY3LJ96wZ3E5GKtwD%2BCgQKvJSzqJZB6KX9TM0NJmtDrSNNM1LMAMJXiGRM3iVuLrpAClj6wuFOmQ48wFHzzDVhbq4lnTRmYereZs4Mez%2FCw7eCKN%2BzQzvpkCBGHGKmVfIkmkY19JSwEzuF4WGonnsYwyhT30IQRiTlE4vBUIvHxJAJ5ZyB7CNrUX6WJPZ9q14duIIwWWKUBfX%2FdnrCj%2BAJMkL52xJphYSFq8EH5Q2ny37TxSQVSp%2FF22ws8t9zgH%2FsaeUapnRLWl7GnYmgrFK21cyWtRp%2FaHmxzF9YB5p5na2VB3I6v7qXzz4OTJCQfjY6GbkXNnFJq1OIJnjkfFrAkKxqlTkDR%2FLpFvAI%2Bk4fmZJTO%2F9lPupNeDrKXYKYS7%2FTt%2BlZTs3hlw8RvKc4EbMfLsh1RHfCN250EOYwSL55tR6b%2BByQB6aJ3sqkFecNFhe54XIFbPpk2u58uHwuzZWjuvtrz92YhQdMjaU9qMni5ao1WL3Oz8cR3236OnobwOClzn67JQGUAuH5cLyk82QjVq6uxsL%2FAY2xghKe7JQr6DA6DMudDec09ylxK6kpeeGRh1tYgSvlCffNsom8k9jb9gQwDe3WMs8hFkCoajWU3po0riKR0XHrKO8%2Fe0ahPq7sd0bWR6nF4QwgpmFygY6pgHBDYCFkbC1yxmMtdp1c9BS4yf%2Fbewoobiiruau2A%2FWhSSjnYMcOq7O2ZXvRi%2BtijXT1ELtMqvWOb2QxS4KwkblBS9DCfkD3LV1D71r4RKxH1t0s7Er1Zu2aZn%2FHKaeVi0bUTzVT9zCBMpF6gr1X%2B8%2BeC8HSgmby0i8NZzVaLA0qvDl3IiKGptflxZr7sVKFv0zGj9Z7ePvkEaXMFc4vXrEvwHhZ8mf&X-Amz-Signature=30bbf74994c0d81ea31dca844378741c7604e73dad60a1a488091c94f7702cf4&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\"></image>\n### Product\nThere is a core operations component to Autonomoy’s MSO offering (mainly setting up in-office infusions) that can be scaled more effectively with technology (mostly around RCM). In the near-term, Autonomy can land-and-expand with technology solutions for initial clinics as they expand to more workflows across a clinic (e..g, starting with prior auth and expanding to referral prioritization).\n**Infusions Playbook**\nThere is a standard playbook for setting up in-office infusions that starts with the RCM foundation. Benefits verification, prior auth, and claim scrubbing are the most critical as practices need to augment their current RCM workflow for specialty pharmacy. In addition, intricacies around A/R, payer communications, and contracting (in case existing contracts don’t reimburse for J-codes) must also be implemented.\nInfusions can be up and running in under 3 months. It starts with an initial assessment with an outbound referral report to see how many infusions were referred out, calculate drug margins if they had been done in clinic, filter only positive margin infusions, and back into the initial number of chairs needed to run the operation. Maximum CapEx is \\$10-\\$30k (refrigerators, safety equipments, chairs, pumps, monitoring devices, TVs, etc) depending on existing infrastructure. Practices can start with just one experienced infusion nurse (\\$80-120k annually) who can handle 3-5 chairs at a time and scale as needed.\n**Buy vs Build **\nThere are multiple companies that are individually building workflows around benefit/eligibility verification (Mandolin), referral management (Valerie Health), prior authorization (Silna), and many other RCM workflows. Initially, Autonomy will stitch together products into their customer’s workflow or build internal solutions where necessary to expedite initial distribution while balancing cost and speed. We have other companies spending \\$1k/month for all prior authorizations, a minuscule amount that will only decrease over time as commoditization drives pricing down. Autonomy is launching at a time where they only stand to benefit from this sea of point solutions.\n<image source=\"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9652a084-ee9f-44b9-84d4-7ccbc428692b/de842f95-02ff-4a4c-9224-fe9b1b589ee3/Screenshot_2025-05-19_at_8.22.21_AM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466RE4VF72K%2F20251216%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251216T125108Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIA%2BQQQO3RLmK2NCxNgsgADf3xy1to54nBzrbnFmoYoQhAiAUHBw2DAsV%2FHzy0BoifU%2BsuUJu6cen7V%2BopQQiWF3BtCr%2FAwhlEAAaDDYzNzQyMzE4MzgwNSIM%2BSDcY3LJ96wZ3E5GKtwD%2BCgQKvJSzqJZB6KX9TM0NJmtDrSNNM1LMAMJXiGRM3iVuLrpAClj6wuFOmQ48wFHzzDVhbq4lnTRmYereZs4Mez%2FCw7eCKN%2BzQzvpkCBGHGKmVfIkmkY19JSwEzuF4WGonnsYwyhT30IQRiTlE4vBUIvHxJAJ5ZyB7CNrUX6WJPZ9q14duIIwWWKUBfX%2FdnrCj%2BAJMkL52xJphYSFq8EH5Q2ny37TxSQVSp%2FF22ws8t9zgH%2FsaeUapnRLWl7GnYmgrFK21cyWtRp%2FaHmxzF9YB5p5na2VB3I6v7qXzz4OTJCQfjY6GbkXNnFJq1OIJnjkfFrAkKxqlTkDR%2FLpFvAI%2Bk4fmZJTO%2F9lPupNeDrKXYKYS7%2FTt%2BlZTs3hlw8RvKc4EbMfLsh1RHfCN250EOYwSL55tR6b%2BByQB6aJ3sqkFecNFhe54XIFbPpk2u58uHwuzZWjuvtrz92YhQdMjaU9qMni5ao1WL3Oz8cR3236OnobwOClzn67JQGUAuH5cLyk82QjVq6uxsL%2FAY2xghKe7JQr6DA6DMudDec09ylxK6kpeeGRh1tYgSvlCffNsom8k9jb9gQwDe3WMs8hFkCoajWU3po0riKR0XHrKO8%2Fe0ahPq7sd0bWR6nF4QwgpmFygY6pgHBDYCFkbC1yxmMtdp1c9BS4yf%2Fbewoobiiruau2A%2FWhSSjnYMcOq7O2ZXvRi%2BtijXT1ELtMqvWOb2QxS4KwkblBS9DCfkD3LV1D71r4RKxH1t0s7Er1Zu2aZn%2FHKaeVi0bUTzVT9zCBMpF6gr1X%2B8%2BeC8HSgmby0i8NZzVaLA0qvDl3IiKGptflxZr7sVKFv0zGj9Z7ePvkEaXMFc4vXrEvwHhZ8mf&X-Amz-Signature=5a8c3ce0d9f7a10b7802ff9bbf294d0d33bbb9476b3db12a5583e747894a7cb4&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\"></image>\nThrough their conversations with clinics over the last year, the team has prioritized prior authorization and referral intake as initial wedges. Prior authorization is required to launch infusions and PAs in the space (especially for Botox) are unique to neurology and require customization for neurologists workflows. Referral prioritization, which entails looking at current patients panels, identifying the highest margin patients, and then engaging and capturing those patients, is a fast-follower for the 2nd piece of the tech build. Prior authorizations are more straightforward and rule-based whereas referral prioritization is more dependent on initial GTM conversations and sophistication, where Autonomy will naturally learn best practices over time from working with their initial clinics.\nIn other areas, Autonomy will start with best-in-breed technology, such as WeInfuse for EMR (\\$3k/month) or Lynx (McKesson) for ordering systems. Over the next 12-18 months, the plan is to develop a practice management system that solves for the key ancillaries in neurology (infusions, toxins, imaging and pharmacy). Autonomy can build this on top of existing EMRs such as Athena/Canvas or integrate with a headless system like Medplum/Aidbox. Owning this system of record (high barriers to entry and high switching costs) will enable the company to create more efficient agents over time as the technology improves instead of retrofitting them to legacy systems. Once Autonomy has provider density in a market, they can negotiate a consolidated payor contract on behalf of these groups. However, in order to do this effectively, they need to either have everyone on a single EMR/PM or under a single TIN (otherwise they run the risk of payers claiming collusion) so the product strategy is ultimately guided in this direction.\n### **GTM **\nAutonomy is currently live with 2 practices (\\$3M practice collections, \\$200K revenue) with 2 others under MSO and contracting (additional \\$400K). Over the next 12-24 months, Autonomy will leverage its partnership with NeuroNet (Neurology GPO with \\$1B in drug sales; 80 clinics) to build density in 1-2 target states, grow take rate from 6% to 10% over time, and reach 15-20+ clinics.\n**Current Clinics: **Autonomy is live with 2 clinics\n- **Customer #1: **Solo neurologist with \\$175K in Net Collections (\\$15K in revenue) acquired through warm intro. However, Autonomy is moving away from this model — the physician was part-time and a great testing ground, but not the ICP.\n- **Customer #2: **3 MDs, 2 NPs with \\$2.6M in net collections (\\$185K revenue) acquired through door-to-door sales.\nUnder LOI and in Contracting:\n- **Texas Neurology: **\\$200-\\$300K ACV for practice with 10 MDs and 5 NPs with potential to expand to \\$500k - \\$1M. Autonomy is starting with referral intake and prior auth.\n- **North Carolina Practice: **\\$200K ACV for practice with 3 MDs and 5 NPs. Initially leading with contracting and working to expand into billing.\nThese four practices represent a total of \\~\\$600–700K potential MSO revenue. The remainder of pipeline is 15 practices in active conversations across 83 neurologists total.\n**Wholesaler Dynamics **\nIn the specialty drug supply chain, pharma manufacturers (e.g., Genentech, Novartis) contract with one of the “big three” wholesalers, Cencora, Cardinal Health, or McKesson, to warehouse and deliver high-cost biologics to infusion centers. These wholesalers partner with specialty GPOs (e.g., NeuroNet, UroGPO Navista/GI Alliance) to negotiate volume-based rebates and secure preferential pricing. As an MSO, Autonomy Health plugs into this network and leverages its GPO relationships to build a neurology-focused formulary, negotiate manufacturer rebates, and guarantee inventory availability. Once terms are set, the practice either purchases drug directly (buy-and-bill) or arranges “white-bagging” (manufacturer ships to the provider’s infusion suite) versus “clear-bagging” (ship to an external specialty pharmacy for on-site delivery). This complexity, which MSOs in other specialties have mastered — can create a significant moat once processes and rebate flows are ironed out.\n<image source=\"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9652a084-ee9f-44b9-84d4-7ccbc428692b/f091b5eb-d271-46f4-8dd1-6627ff70b071/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466RE4VF72K%2F20251216%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251216T125108Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIA%2BQQQO3RLmK2NCxNgsgADf3xy1to54nBzrbnFmoYoQhAiAUHBw2DAsV%2FHzy0BoifU%2BsuUJu6cen7V%2BopQQiWF3BtCr%2FAwhlEAAaDDYzNzQyMzE4MzgwNSIM%2BSDcY3LJ96wZ3E5GKtwD%2BCgQKvJSzqJZB6KX9TM0NJmtDrSNNM1LMAMJXiGRM3iVuLrpAClj6wuFOmQ48wFHzzDVhbq4lnTRmYereZs4Mez%2FCw7eCKN%2BzQzvpkCBGHGKmVfIkmkY19JSwEzuF4WGonnsYwyhT30IQRiTlE4vBUIvHxJAJ5ZyB7CNrUX6WJPZ9q14duIIwWWKUBfX%2FdnrCj%2BAJMkL52xJphYSFq8EH5Q2ny37TxSQVSp%2FF22ws8t9zgH%2FsaeUapnRLWl7GnYmgrFK21cyWtRp%2FaHmxzF9YB5p5na2VB3I6v7qXzz4OTJCQfjY6GbkXNnFJq1OIJnjkfFrAkKxqlTkDR%2FLpFvAI%2Bk4fmZJTO%2F9lPupNeDrKXYKYS7%2FTt%2BlZTs3hlw8RvKc4EbMfLsh1RHfCN250EOYwSL55tR6b%2BByQB6aJ3sqkFecNFhe54XIFbPpk2u58uHwuzZWjuvtrz92YhQdMjaU9qMni5ao1WL3Oz8cR3236OnobwOClzn67JQGUAuH5cLyk82QjVq6uxsL%2FAY2xghKe7JQr6DA6DMudDec09ylxK6kpeeGRh1tYgSvlCffNsom8k9jb9gQwDe3WMs8hFkCoajWU3po0riKR0XHrKO8%2Fe0ahPq7sd0bWR6nF4QwgpmFygY6pgHBDYCFkbC1yxmMtdp1c9BS4yf%2Fbewoobiiruau2A%2FWhSSjnYMcOq7O2ZXvRi%2BtijXT1ELtMqvWOb2QxS4KwkblBS9DCfkD3LV1D71r4RKxH1t0s7Er1Zu2aZn%2FHKaeVi0bUTzVT9zCBMpF6gr1X%2B8%2BeC8HSgmby0i8NZzVaLA0qvDl3IiKGptflxZr7sVKFv0zGj9Z7ePvkEaXMFc4vXrEvwHhZ8mf&X-Amz-Signature=3825e853ac88728d87469a0fa942cbc10e6b48422dcb8416ad06b7be57617dde&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\"></image>\nOnce an MSO reaches sufficient scale (e.g., by bundling dozens of practices or specialties) it can command GPO leverage, participate in manufacturer rebate pools, secure favorable payment terms and amortize its fixed operating costs. Prior to that, Autonomy can mitigate the risks of a small, single-specialty MSO through a combination of strategic partnerships, financial engineering, and operational excellence. The NeuroNet GPO Partnership is one of the biggest early GTM advantages and can’t be understated. NeuroNet is announcing Autonomy this month as their MSO partner for practice optimization and workflows. \\$1B in drug sales flows through NeuroNet’s GPO across 80+ clinics. Other companies (e.g., HouseRx in rheumatology) had to negotiate with wholesalers/GPOs to drive positive margins on Rheumtaology drugs.\n### **Financing / Milestones **\nUltimately, Autonomy needs to build tech that can help them land with practices and show they can operationalize in-office infusions to expand revenue (and Autonomy’s take-rate) over time. Management intends to build methodically in 2025 with and serving only \\~4-5 clinic partners before scaling to 15+ over the next 18-24 months.\n**Market Comps. **We did an a[nalysis of other MSO or ACO models in different specialties]({{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a83CkSB95Z7x7hfhfkKzWDE3Rk7nXU4_z6-NVhS1r5Q/edit?gid=0#gid=0}}) (Autism, Primary Care, Cardiology) to understand Series A milestones from a revenue perspective. Given the capital efficient nature of MSOs and the operational playbook, Series A/B investors have a better sense of how to value these businesses. We’re seeing gross profit multiples range from 10-15x and 20x on the high-end for competitive rounds that give companies credit for future growth. If we assume 70% gross profit on net revenue, which is consistent with other comps with similar levels of clinical services, and expansion to 10% take-rate, Autonomy should be shooting for \\$3M gross profit. The quality of this gross profit will depend on some more qualitative factors of the business mentioned below, but these projections are largely in line with management’s goals (shown below).\n<image source=\"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9652a084-ee9f-44b9-84d4-7ccbc428692b/d23ac8e1-78a3-4e4b-ae53-037c508b3c82/Screenshot_2025-05-20_at_9.42.16_AM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466RE4VF72K%2F20251216%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20251216T125108Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIA%2BQQQO3RLmK2NCxNgsgADf3xy1to54nBzrbnFmoYoQhAiAUHBw2DAsV%2FHzy0BoifU%2BsuUJu6cen7V%2BopQQiWF3BtCr%2FAwhlEAAaDDYzNzQyMzE4MzgwNSIM%2BSDcY3LJ96wZ3E5GKtwD%2BCgQKvJSzqJZB6KX9TM0NJmtDrSNNM1LMAMJXiGRM3iVuLrpAClj6wuFOmQ48wFHzzDVhbq4lnTRmYereZs4Mez%2FCw7eCKN%2BzQzvpkCBGHGKmVfIkmkY19JSwEzuF4WGonnsYwyhT30IQRiTlE4vBUIvHxJAJ5ZyB7CNrUX6WJPZ9q14duIIwWWKUBfX%2FdnrCj%2BAJMkL52xJphYSFq8EH5Q2ny37TxSQVSp%2FF22ws8t9zgH%2FsaeUapnRLWl7GnYmgrFK21cyWtRp%2FaHmxzF9YB5p5na2VB3I6v7qXzz4OTJCQfjY6GbkXNnFJq1OIJnjkfFrAkKxqlTkDR%2FLpFvAI%2Bk4fmZJTO%2F9lPupNeDrKXYKYS7%2FTt%2BlZTs3hlw8RvKc4EbMfLsh1RHfCN250EOYwSL55tR6b%2BByQB6aJ3sqkFecNFhe54XIFbPpk2u58uHwuzZWjuvtrz92YhQdMjaU9qMni5ao1WL3Oz8cR3236OnobwOClzn67JQGUAuH5cLyk82QjVq6uxsL%2FAY2xghKe7JQr6DA6DMudDec09ylxK6kpeeGRh1tYgSvlCffNsom8k9jb9gQwDe3WMs8hFkCoajWU3po0riKR0XHrKO8%2Fe0ahPq7sd0bWR6nF4QwgpmFygY6pgHBDYCFkbC1yxmMtdp1c9BS4yf%2Fbewoobiiruau2A%2FWhSSjnYMcOq7O2ZXvRi%2BtijXT1ELtMqvWOb2QxS4KwkblBS9DCfkD3LV1D71r4RKxH1t0s7Er1Zu2aZn%2FHKaeVi0bUTzVT9zCBMpF6gr1X%2B8%2BeC8HSgmby0i8NZzVaLA0qvDl3IiKGptflxZr7sVKFv0zGj9Z7ePvkEaXMFc4vXrEvwHhZ8mf&X-Amz-Signature=1a1f357b54288cd9595509bd238466f8811178c711fbc70f5f360d78c5856284&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\"></image>\n**Product. **We are confident that the team can operationalize prior auth and initial referral intake. These are known solutions with many vendors and the team already understands the nuanced workflows for these areas to solve for the last 20% of complexity that is specific to neurology. Referral prioritization, the ability to analyze claims data in a market, identify and drive referrals based on gross margin, keep those patients coming back to the office, and even driving new patients to a clinic, is a bigger lift. We think this can unlock real advantages on the GTM side, so are pushing the team to accomplish this by the beginning of 2026. Other product goals mentioned above (building their own EMR, switching practices to same system of record for payer contracting) are 12-18 month goals as the team prepares to demonstrate their ability to build real network effects.\n**Operations. **The playbook for infusions is known, but a big milestone for this fundraise is to demonstrate the ability and speed to set up infusions, drive volume, and show durable revenue in a practice. This involves all the RCM infrastructure described in product above, but also the ability for Autonomy to reduce time from first meeting to convincing practices to set up infusions, enabling practices to hire high-quality infusion nurses, streamlining drug acquisition (and associated working capital), and ensure minimal disruption to the overall workflow of a practice.\n**Take Rate Expansion. **Expanding the take-rate from 6% to 10% over time will drive more revenue to Autonomy, but more strategically, its a quantifiable measure of the durable value that Autonomy can provide to practices over time. There is a theoretical risk that once Autonomy sets up in-office infusions in a practice, these practices might leave the MSO in year 2 or 3 after they understand the workflow. We like the neurology space and the Autonomy model because there are 2 tangible network effects that protect Autonomy from this: 1) payer contracts and 2) drug pricing leverage. We’ve seen negotiated payer contracts with MSOs drive reimbursement up to 20% higher and drug pricing leverage with GPOs can drive additional 5-10% improvements. Practices will not blink at a 4% increase in take rate over a time period when Autonomy can drive that level of gain over the same time period.\n### **Risks / Opportunities **\n<span color=\"green\">**Opportunities **</span>\n- **First Mover Advantage. **There are no scaled neurology MSOs and growth in the neurology drug market has just begun to inflect. This first-mover advantage has led to valuable partnerships with NeuroNet that expedite initial GTM. Autonomy only needs to be in 2-3 states to build a \\$50M+ ARR business and they have the ability to scale rapidly and choose the most attractive states for their model (current focus on TX and NC) as the only game in town. Autonomy’s model also leads to real network effects (payer contracting + drug pricing), which allows the company to harness these first-mover advantages for long-term, durable differentiation.\n- **Ideal MSO Attributes. **We’ve seen a pitch for nearly every MSO for every specialty over the last 3-4 years, but few have had the key characteristics that we see as key to scaling a successful MSO model. Autonomy can double physician comp, is attractive to payers at scale (vs. driving up costs), and has real network effects (payer contracting + drug pricing) that drive durable take-rates and long-term advantages. Furthermore, the neurologist market can be considered as highly fragmented — and likely in the 200–400  Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) range indicating a highly fragmented and competitive market.\n- **Additional drugs in pipeline (Alzheimer’s, ALS, Parkinson’s, etc). **Autonomy can build a \\$100M ARR business without betting on future drug launches in disease areas like Alzheimers, ALS, Parkinson’s and other rare neurology disorders. If even 10% of these drugs come to market in next 3-5 years, Autonomy will be well positioned as a leader in the space already to reap the benefits from these drug launches. We view these additional disease areas as a “cherry on top” of an already massive market opportunity.\n<span color=\"red\">**Risks**</span>\n- **Negotiating leverage for drugs. **Single-specialty MSOs that are starting out with initial practices typically don’t have the scale to negotiate drug pricing with manufacturers, wholesalers, or GPOs to drive favorable COGS that increases margin for drug administration. Autonomy has de-risked this massively with its NeuroNet partnership (\\$1B in drug sales; 80 practices) but we are still acutely ware of these dynamics and how Autonomy can continually protect itself from single party risk or shifts in the market.\n- **In-office infusion setup. **While there is a playbook for in-office infusion setup and the 2x increase in physician comp is attractive, setting up infusions still requires a change in workflow and additional hiring. There is a risk that physicians delay the adoption of in-office infusions, which would increase sales cycles and reduce take-rates. The precedent set by other specialties and the difference in physician comp (\\$100k -\\$300K in personal take-home) give us confidence Autonomy can navigate these operational considerations.\n- **Regulatory shifts. **MFN drug pricing negotiations could reduce drug costs for Part B, and therefore reduce the margin that providers are getting from drug administration (margin = % of drug cost). CMS is discussing moving to site-neutral payments, which would reduce the total cost of care reduction for payers in moving infusions from HOPD to in-office. Payers are shifting towards white-bagging vs. buy-and-bill to capture more of the drug margin for themselves vs. allowing providers to charge ASP + 4-6%. There have been numerous changes in the drug supply chain over the last decade across wholesalers, manufacturers (branded, generic, biosimilars), GPOs, MSOs, PSAOs, and specialty pharmacies. There is margin to be made in driving the use of innovative therapies from payers, providers, and/or biopharma. If you own the provider relationship (as Autonomy plans to do) you can adapt to these changes and target the highest margin areas of the stack.\n<empty-block/>\n//\n\n**END**\n<empty-block/>\n</content>\n</page>"}

Thought process: Unearthed relevant investment memo on Autonomy Health.

This is fantastic - I found a detailed investment memo about Autonomy Health, a tech-enabled MSO specifically focused on helping neurologists stay independent. This is extremely relevant to the neurology MSO discussion. Let me add this context to the earlier response.

This is incredibly relevant—you have **Autonomy Health** in your portfolio, which is essentially the thesis we just discussed playing out in real-time. Let me add that context:

## Integrating Autonomy Health Context

**Your Notion memo confirms the investment thesis:**

The Autonomy memo validates exactly what the public research showed—**neurology is the next frontier for MSO consolidation**, and the model works because of three key factors:

### 1. **The "Why Now" is Drug Market Growth**
From the memo: *"In the 2020's, the neurology drug market (often classified as the central nervous system (CNS) drug market) surpassed $100B in drug sales for the first time in a decade... This growth of the drug market is a key pillar in the 'why now?' for investing into Autonomy — this business and model would not have been as attractive 3-5 years ago without the revenue uplift provided by drug margin for physicians."*

This is the critical insight—the infusion economics only work now because MS drugs (Ocrevus, Tysabri), migraine biologics, and neuromuscular treatments have reached sufficient volume and margin.

### 2. **Physician Economics: The 2X Comp Multiplier**
The memo quantifies what other MSO models struggle to deliver: *"Adding infusions and injectables can 2X a provider's comp. This is far beyond what we see in other MSO models (Finni for BCBAs, Headway/Grow for Mental Health, Chamber for Cardiology, Nourish/Fay for dietitians) that typically hover around 10-20%."*

This is the physician autonomy value prop—**neurologists stay independent AND double their take-home pay**. That's differentiated from the PE roll-up model (Nira Medical) where physicians cede control.

### 3. **Payer-Aligned Economics (Rare in MSOs)**
From the memo: *"For Autonomy, in comparison, payers want to move infusions out of hospital outpatient departments (HOPD) where infusions are 3-4x the cost of in-office administration. It's a rare win-win for providers (increase comp) and payers (decrease costs)."*

This is the "so what" for durability—unlike dermatology or GI roll-ups where PE-backed groups leveraged market power to raise prices (triggering regulatory backlash), Autonomy's model actually **reduces** total cost of care. That's a structural moat against the regulatory risk we discussed in the earlier research.

### 4. **Competitive Landscape Validates White Space**
The memo breaks down the competitive landscape:
- **Nira Medical** (SilverSmith/Transformation Capital) – PE roll-up model, ~50 neurologists, requires giving up ownership
- **Multi-specialty MSOs** (Triarq, SCALE) – consulting-style, no tech moat
- **Wholesaler solutions** (McKesson IntraFusion) – generic, not specialty-tailored

Autonomy's differentiation: **Physicians keep ownership + tech-enabled operations + NeuroNet GPO partnership** ($1B drug volume for purchasing leverage out of the gate).

### 5. **Market Sizing Confirms Earlier Research**
The memo notes: *"There are ~20,000 neurologists across the country, mostly in fragmented smaller clinics (~37% hospital employment), and we estimate 50% are independent neurologists that can be targeted with an MSO model... Only 10% of neurologists have infusions in their office today, and Autonomy's opportunity is to help bring the other 90% online."*

This aligns with Cascade Partners' finding that neurology has "no scaled PE-backed national platform" and most practices are 1-3 physicians.

## The "So What" for Your Portfolio

**Autonomy sits at a strategic intersection:**
- **Favorable MSO characteristics** (high fragmentation, 2x physician comp, payer-aligned, network effects)
- **First-mover in $100B+ drug market** that's just beginning to inflect
- **Tech-enabled vs. consulting model** creates defensibility
- **NeuroNet partnership** de-risks the drug purchasing leverage challenge

**Risk to watch:** The memo flags *"There is a theoretical risk that once Autonomy sets up in-office infusions in a practice, these practices might leave the MSO in year 2 or 3 after they understand the workflow."* The counter is payer contracting leverage (+20% reimbursement) and GPO drug pricing (5-10% improvement) at scale—but that requires execution.

**Series A milestones per memo:** ~$3M gross profit, 15+ clinics, demonstrated network effects (payer contracts + drug pricing). Target take-rate expansion from 6% → 10%.

Want me to pull any additional context from the memo or cross-reference with the broader MSO economics research?

Thought process: Synthesized specialty MSO trends within broader healthcare landscape context.

The user is asking me to contextualize the rise of specialty-focused MSOs (like neurology) within the broader healthcare services landscape, using the uploaded Nephron Research 2026 Healthcare Services Outlook PDF. Let me read this document to understand the broader trends and then synthesize it with what we've discussed about neurology MSOs.

Nephron flags regulatory risk from 2028 MFN (Most Favored Nation) pricing which "could radically reduce specialty provider profitability if not altered prior to implementation." This is the key risk to infusion economics that any neurology MSO must plan for.

How do you prepare for this risk?
