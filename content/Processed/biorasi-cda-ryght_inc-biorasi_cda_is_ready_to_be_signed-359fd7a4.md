Corporate Way, #12489, Anaheim, California 92801 United States of America, (individually, "Party," or collectively, “Parties").

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to explore a potential business relationship (“Purpose”), and in the course of those discussions it is understood and agreed that certain information proprietary and confidential to a Party or its Affiliate (as defined below) may be disclosed (collectively, the “Disclosing Party”) to the other Party or its Affiliates (collectively, the “Receiving Party");

WHEREAS, the Parties recognize and agree that by completing this Agreement, the Parties hereby consent and authorize the collection and probable transfer of personal identifiable information (“PII”) for the intended Purpose, stated herein, as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”) and other applicable in-country privacy laws;

(b) "Affiliate" shall mean any person or entity which is, directly or indirectly, controlling, controlled by, or is under common control with a Party.

### Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure

## ELECTRONIC RECORD AND SIGNATURE DISCLOSURE

From time to time, Biorasi, LLC (we, us or Company) may be required by law to provide to you certain written notices or disclosures. Described below are the terms and conditions for providing to you such notices and disclosures electronically through the DocuSign system. Please read the information below carefully and thoroughly, and if you can access this information electronically to your satisfaction and agree to this Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure (ERSD), please confirm your agreement by selecting the check-box next to ‘I agree to use electronic records and signatures' before clicking “CONTINUE” within the DocuSign system.

### Getting paper copies

At any time, you may request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available electronically to you by us. You will have the ability to download and print documents we send to you through the DocuSign system during and immediately after the signing session and, if you elect to create a DocuSign account, you may access the documents for a limited period of time (usually 30 days) after such documents are first sent to you. After such time, if you wish for us to send you paper copies of any such documents from our office to you, you will be charged a $0.00 per-page fee. You may request delivery of such paper copies from us by following the procedure described below.

### Withdrawing your consent

If you decide to receive notices and disclosures from us electronically, you may at any time change your mind and tell us that thereafter you want to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format. How you must inform us of your decision to receive future notices and disclosure in paper format and withdraw your consent to receive notices and disclosures electronically is described below.

### Consequences of changing your mind

If you elect to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format, it will slow the speed at which we can complete certain steps in transactions with you and delivering services to you because we will need first to send the required notices or disclosures to you in paper format, and then wait until we receive back from you your acknowledgment of your receipt of such paper notices or disclosures. Further, you will no longer be able to use the DocuSign system to receive required notices and consents electronically from us or to sign electronically documents from us.

All notices and disclosures will be sent to you electronically

Unless you tell us otherwise in accordance with the procedures described herein, we will provide electronically to you through the DocuSign system all required notices, disclosures, authorizations, acknowledgements, and other documents that are required to be provided or made available to you during the course of our relationship with you. To reduce the chance of you inadvertently not receiving any notice or disclosure, we prefer to provide all of the required notices and disclosures to you by the same method and to the same address that you have given us. Thus, you can receive all the disclosures and notices electronically or in paper format through the paper mail delivery system. If you do not agree with this process, please let us know as described below.
