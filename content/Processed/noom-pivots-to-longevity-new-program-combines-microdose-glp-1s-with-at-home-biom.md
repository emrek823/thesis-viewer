What You Should Know:

– Noom has launched Proactive Health Microdose GLP-1Rx, a first-of-its-kind preventive health program designed to intervene before chronic disease takes root.

– Available to individuals with a BMI of 21 or higher, the offering combines personalized microdoses of GLP-1 medication with comprehensive at-home biomarker testing and Noom’s digital behavior modification platform.

– Priced at $149 per month, the program aims to shift the healthcare paradigm from reactive treatment to proactive longevity by improving metabolic health through a blend of biology, psychology, and technology.

The Pivot to Prevention: Noom bets on “Bridge Medicine” with Microdose GLP-1s and Deep Diagnostics

For the past decade, digital health has largely been a game of reaction—waiting for a diagnosis and then managing the symptoms. Today, Noom signaled a definitive shift in that narrative with the launch of Proactive Health Microdose GLP-1Rx.

Moving beyond its roots in weight loss, the company is positioning itself as a longevity platform. The new offering is not designed solely for those with clinical obesity; it is available to adults with a BMI of 21 or higher—the vast majority of the U.S. population. By pairing low-dose GLP-1 medications with rigorous blood diagnostics and behavioral coaching, Noom aims to intercept metabolic dysfunction before it becomes chronic disease.

“The problem we’re solving is that most Americans are living with suboptimal health — and their blood biomarkers show it,” said Dr. Jeffrey Egler, Chief Medical Officer at Noom. “That eventually manifests as chronic disease.”

The “Microdose” Strategy: Broadening Access to GLP-1s

The headline feature of the program is the use of microdosed GLP-1 medications. Unlike traditional weight-loss prescriptions that ramp up to high doses, this program utilizes smaller, personalized amounts intended to “spark” metabolic improvement without necessarily driving rapid weight loss.

This approach allows Noom to expand eligibility to people who may not qualify for standard obesity treatments but still face cardiometabolic risks. Dr. Egler notes that the starting dose is only 25% of the lowest starting dose in Noom’s other programs, with careful, personalized titration.

“GLP-1s are not a shortcut — they’re the spark,” Egler explained. “They open the door for change, but actively walking through that door is what makes the transformation last. It’s not band-aid medicine, it’s bridge medicine.”

Data You Can See: The Biomarker Engine

While medication provides the physiological assist, data provides the roadmap. The program includes a Noom Biomarkers test kit delivered every four months. Utilizing the Tasso+ device for virtually painless capillary blood collection, the kit tracks 17 advanced markers often overlooked in standard annual physicals, including:

ApoB & Lp(a): Emerging predictors for heart disease.

HbA1c: The gold standard for tracking blood sugar control and prediabetes.

hs-CRP: A critical marker for “silent” inflammation.

Hormonal Health: Tracking Testosterone, Estradiol, and DHEA-S for resilience and aging.

“When members understand their bloodwork today, they can strive to improve it tomorrow,” said Noom CEO Geoff Cook. “Within just 16 weeks, they can see for themselves the change in their biomarkers.”

Behavior as the Anchor

Noom is betting that medication alone is insufficient for long-term health—a view supported by data showing high discontinuation rates for GLP-1s. The company’s internal data indicates that members highly engaged with the digital companion app lose 50% more weight than those in the bottom quartile of engagement.

The Noom Longevity Companion app is designed to convert the “food noise” reduction provided by the medication into permanent habit formation. Currently, 40% of active Microdose members use the app daily to log meals, workouts, and stress-reduction techniques.

“Health becomes habit, not effort,” Cook noted. “When identity begins to shift, the door opens to broader transformation.”

The Bottom Line

With 80% of U.S. adults with prediabetes currently undiagnosed, Noom’s strategy addresses a massive gap in the American healthcare system. By democratizing access to advanced diagnostics and “longevity medicine,” the company is attempting to prove that the best way to cure chronic disease is to prevent it entirely.

The Proactive Health Microdose GLP-1Rx Program is available now to eligible members for $149 per month.
