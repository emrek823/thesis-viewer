**Client**
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about Assort Health. Would love to maybe just start with your background, the firm you work at and how big and how many patients and how many locations and the background on the firm and we can dive in from there.

**Expert**
Sounds great. I've been in dentistry for about 15 years, most of that in the DSO space. I've worked my way up from office manager to regional manager, VP of ops and eventually COO of a nationwide DSO of 70 locations. After that, I went into management consulting and helping entrepreneur dentists run their practice as well as buy practices and start practices. I joined my current position which is Shared Practices Group. It's a full arch dentistry DSO. DSO means Dental Support Organization.

**Client**
Got it. DSO, Dental Support Organization .

**Expert**
Yeah. Like a corporate chain. That's what it means. We have 36 locations.

**Client**
Where are they located?

**Expert**
All over the U.S.. We go to secondary markets so Reno, Sarasota, things like that. I assume you don't know dentistry, but full arch implants is the most expensive and specialized procedure in dentistry. It's basically giving you a whole new smile. It's a smile makeover and functions just like regular teeth so you can eat anything. Dentures, you can't do that. You can't eat steak and things like that. We only do that. We specialize in that.

**Client**
You do full arch implants. That's the whole thing. That's your whole business.

**Expert**
It's 80% of our business. We have downgrades. We have something called implant supported dentures, which are dentures supported by implants. We also offer dentures, but we only offer those two options. From a sales perspective, we can anchor the full arch. We don't make money on dentures, for example. It's only there so we can show the shortcomings of the denture and convince the patient that the full arch is called all-on-X. All-on-four, is the name of the procedure, is the best for them. That's all we do.

**Client**
Got it. Just to clarify, 36 locations all over the U.S. in secondary markets like Reno, Sarasota, etc. Nearly all of your business, 80% is full arch implants and then the rest of it you don't actually make money on the rest of the 20%, which is dentures. They're just helping you almost upsell people to get full arch implants, which is effectively giving someone a whole new smile. It's a complicated, complex procedure. I'm assuming it's an elective procedure.

**Expert**
Yes. It's elective procedure. The full mouth costs are in the tens of thousands. It's very expensive, too. That's our industry. What this means that our patient acquisition costs and our marketing is of utmost importance, because when we get a patient, we get them just for that procedure. Once it's done, they go back to their dentist for cleanings. There's not a recurring relationship. We do the procedure, and then you're no longer our patient. Now it takes about six months to get everything done, but still.

We spend about 15% of our revenue on marketing, which means that maximizing that pipeline, those leads is half the business. I always say we're basically a sales. We're a marketing and sales organization that happens to sell full arch dentistry more so than a dental organization. Maximizing that lead flow is key. We had a call. I'm going to talk about how we were before we went with Assort. We had a call center in the U.S. Remote, stay-at-home moms, things like that.

We also had a call center overseas as a backup. If all our agents in the U.S. were busy, it would go overseas. Our goal was obviously to miss almost zero calls or the least possible and to convert the most possible. Before Assort, we were missing about 15% of our calls. The reason why was that we realized through the numbers that if you don't answer the phone within four rings, the patient hangs up. There's a 97% chance they hang up. You got four rings to answer.

Our patients, they are educated buyers. We're not the first place they call. Rarely. They've usually been diagnosed and presented a treatment somewhere else. They're trying to decide who to go with. If we don't answer, they just call the next person on Google or they don't give you a shot. Now, from a call center perspective, it's cost prohibitive to answer 99% of calls within four rings.

The reason why is because the calls, they don't come in evenly distributed, they come in spikes. It's really hard. You have to have coverage for the spikes, for the high volume times of the day. You can't pay someone to just be there for an hour. You got to pay them for the whole day or at least half of the day.

**Client**
One question for you. Apologies. How many people do you employ in your onshore and offshore call centers today? What's the total cost of that?

**Expert**
Let me tell you how it was before Assort, because if I tell you today, I'm telling you the after Assort.

**Client**
Yeah. Before, totally. I just want to compare the before and after, so the before.

**Expert**
For sure. Before, we spent between $20,000 and $80,000 a month in payroll that also included some software expenses, but most of it was payroll. We've employed 15 people in the U.S., and I believe there were another 15 or 20 overseas in Zimbabwe. We're trying to solve that problem. How do we get from 15% missed opportunity down?

The other problem we were trying to solve is not all our calls are what we call new business opportunities. A lot of times they are existing patients, patients who's already signed up, who is calling back to make a payment or is calling to confirm an appointment or maybe cancel an appointment, but they're existing patient calls. They're less valuable. They've already paid us, they've already signed up or even if they are calling to sign up, they've already chosen you.

**Client**
What percent of calls is that versus new leads?

**Expert**
60% are existing patient calls.

**Client**
60%.

**Expert**
You got like 5%, 10% miscellaneous. All the sales calls and U.S. calls. New business opportunities were between 30%-35%. Now, the problem we had was that our U.S. agents are significantly better at handling new business opportunities than our overseas agents. The reason why is because this is a sales call. This isn't a, "Hey, I'm calling to make an appointment."

You're not just doing admin work. Some of these people, they cry on the phone. This is an emotional call. Some of them are embarrassed that they've let their teeth to get at this point. Because our U.S. is the same culture and background as our callers, that allow them to build more rapport and empathy with the caller, while overseas, even if they were saying the right things and we even try the external removal software through AI. AI has an external removal.

**Client**
Yeah. They're just not in tune with the cultural norms. I totally get it.

**Expert**
That's right. That didn't work either. It's a stay-at-home mom calling another stay-at-home mom. That's what works. Now, our U.S. agents were only spending about 35% of their time on new business opportunities. I wanted to know how do I get them to answer 80% of their calls, new patient opportunities, and the overseas people to answer less, because if it's an existing patient, I've already got their money.

I'm okay if they speak to the people in Zimbabwe who's not from the same cultural background, but I've got to figure out a way to maximize my U.S. agents so they're spending more of their time on high-value calls. There was a second problem I was trying to solve. My first problem was a missed call. Second problem was the distribution of calls.

The third problem I was trying to solve was the cost per call. Our cost per call was at $8 to answer a phone call between payroll and software, and that kind of stuff. That took a lot of money. $8 to just answer the call, any call, all calls. A call was $8. That was unscalable. It was profitable for us at 36 locations, but when we forecasted it out to 50, 60, it would've gotten to the point where it would be unscalable. We got to figure out how to decrease the cost per call.

Q2 2024, that's when these conversational Als started popping out. I looked at ones that weren't dental specific, like Hello Patient. Hello Patient is healthcare specific, but not dental. There was also one that started with a P. It's a really weird name. That one. Terrible name. I don't know why they did that. I can never remember it.

We looked into that one, but I felt that I wanted one that had experience with dental. I don't know why, because honestly now I think back and I don't think it matters but at the time, I felt like it did. Assort Health came to us because Jon, the founder went to Stanford with our founder. Our founder was on LinkedIn and saw that Jon had released this thing and he knew that I was working on this project, so he sent it over to me.

When your founder, when your boss sends you a company to look into, politically, you take it seriously. They become the front runner, because you want to please your boss. To be fair, I don't think the vetting was very fair between the companies. That doesn't mean that I would have chosen another one. I think maybe we would have chosen Hello Patient. Hello Patient they were further along in their development.

Assort, when we started talking to them, they literally were brand new. They had no onboarding, they had no customer success. Their software was still being built, but one of the things that we really. they were very early. If it wasn't for the fact that it came from my founder and CEO at the time, I think I would have gone with Hello Patient just because they were further along.

We also wanted someone who would treat us like a big client, meaning they would maybe customize some things for us and build some out-of-the-box solutions because we felt that we were very specific and Hello Patient wasn't willing to do that at all. They were like, "No, our product's our product. Whatever customizations will be the customizations that are in the product, but we're not going to develop things for you."

Where Assort was like, "Yeah you guys will be our biggest clients from day one, so we could build things for you." That was a really, really big positive and probably our biggest deciding factor. When it comes to quality, people ask me about quality it's like, "Dude, they all send you sample calls and they all sound great on the sample calls." Who knows who's the best in quality. I don't know. They all sound amazing, but you really just have to use it to really figure out.

**Client**
When did you start using it? When did you implement it? How do you use it today? What's the call volume? Did it solve your problems?

**Expert**
Yeah. We started with the pilot of 10 offices and our goal was this, one, if a call gets to the fourth ring without an answer, Assort has to answer it. That was how we started it. Once we did that, that was just the fix of 15%. Within a week, not only did the data show that our missed call was less than 2%, but we also saw that Assort had actually scheduled patients.

We were like, "Oh," because I was thinking they would maybe send a message to the front desk and the front desk would handle it. They went all the way to scheduling it. That was great. The more calls that they came, it got better and better because it learns on itself. I'm like, "Okay, problem one fixed. Let's roll that out across the board." We rolled it out in Q3 to all 36.

Now all 36, by the time it gets to the fourth ring, Assort answers. We fixed that across the board. That gave us a slight increase in new patient consults, new business. On to the next problem was, "Okay, how do we get the U.S. agents to answer more high-value calls?" That's when the building of custom features came in. Their engineer said, "Oh, here's what we can do. We can build something called a phone lookup, so when the phone call comes in, what it's going to do, it's going to scan your patient database.

**Client**
Yep. It will tell you whether it's new or existing and then if it's new, it funnels it to the U.S. and if it's existing, Assort will take the call itself.

**Expert**
Exactly. They built that for us, we piloted it and within two weeks, our U.S. agents went from 36% new business to 70%. What was even more surprising is that their conversion rate per call went up. If they're doing more of the same type of calls, they get better at it. They get more focused. Again, work, we rolled it out across the board but we rolled it out across the board in the beginning of Q4. Not throughout Q4. Q4 was the first quarter where we had Assort answering calls that went to the four ring and finally calls to the U.S. call center and also answering all existing patient calls.

Instead of it going overseas to the Zimbabwe call center, we said, "Okay, well, if it doesn't exist," he said, "The recognized phone number, let's just send it to Assort." What's the difference between Zimbabwe and an AI agent? Of course, we tested it for a week or two and we rolled it out across the board. By the end of Q4, that was the setup. We had to get rid of the whole overseas call center.

**Client**
Got it. The 15 U.S. agents and then Assort, what are you paying Assort?

**Expert**
Okay. Assort, they first came to us trying to charge us a cost per call. They were like, "Hey, you pay $8 per call, so we can do it for four." I was like, "Get out of here. That's not how it works." You're software not paying you a cost per call basis. What we came up with was a monthly subsea for each office. That gave us a bank of calls. I can't remember what the number is, can't remember what the maximum is. If we went over that, then we would pay $2 per call. Q4 last year, we did go over it. We had to actually write them a check. We went over quite a lot.

**Client**
For those three months?

**Expert**
For three months for 36 locations, we paid in overage. It's okay for us. What I told them is, "Look, we want predictability. I don't want, one month, the bill to be $10,000. The other month the bill is $30,000. No, it's better for us to have the same amount every month, and then we reconcile at the end of the quarter." I don't know if that's how they charge everyone else, if that's how their pricing got rolled out. I don't know what it is that they do officially, but that's what they did with us at the time.

**Client**
You're paying per month per location with an overage fee. My question to you is how many dentists are at any given location? Is it one per location, so there's 36 dentists total?

**Expert**
Correct.

**Client**
Interesting. You pay Assort that and then what is your U.S. call center cost now? I'm trying to understand, your total cost was $20,000 to $80,000 a month before. What is your total cost now?

**Expert**
Yeah. I don't know what our total cost is now, but I can tell you our cost per call went from $8 to $3.70-something. $3.73, $3.74.

**Client**
40% decrease.

**Expert**
Yeah. It changed our business. Most importantly, new consults went up by 10%. What caused that wasn't Assort answering the phone ring, was having the U.S. agents answering more calls that were high value. That increased our new consults by 10%. That, across 36 locations, is six to seven figures in profit. That was huge.

**Client**
Very cool. Assort came in, you get rid of the Zimbabwe call center, you reroute more important calls to the U.S. call agent so your cost per call drops, but more importantly you end up getting more high-value business.

**Expert**
Yeah. Within the same volume of calls, I was able to filter them to the right people.

**Client**
Yeah. It's the same business. Totally. Is there anything you'd like to change or add or are there features you wish they would build?

**Expert**
Yeah. Taking payments, right now, they have to transfer to the front desk and it'll be great if they could just take the payment. Why not take a payment right there? Whenever they answer, whenever one of the fourth ring calls is a new business opportunity. I don't know if it's an error in the system but sometimes even if it's a recognized number ends up being a new business. It's rare. My point is sometimes it answers new business opportunities and the conversion rate on that is very, very bad. It's like 5%. It makes sense.

I am asking for too much here but the whole idea that it's going to replace humans, I think that yes for admin calls. The more salesy and convincing the calls needs and empathy and rapport, the less likely they are to work. I wish they were better at that, but maybe I'm asking for too much. The other thing is we also tried outbound calling.

We have patients that come in and they don't move forward with treatment, and there's need to be a follow up, that didn't work. What works the best is the person that sold them when they came in. The treatment coordinator, the office manager who built rapport when they came in is the person who is more likely to get something on a follow up because they feel rapport.

I will even say that extending beyond our business, I don't think people want to get a call from an AI agent. That to me is like spam. There's a lot of talk about outbound calling with AI. I personally don't want to get a call like that. The other thing is their onboarding was very bad. Now again, they were new and he did say that it was going to be tough, so he was honest. I don't know if it still sucks, but onboarding sucked. Their analytics dashboard could be a lot better. We can see how many calls they took.

**Client**
How long did it take to onboard?

**Expert**
It took a whole quarter. We were ready to go. Every time we tried something, because we did different levels. Every time we had to implement something new, we wanted it done in two weeks and they couldn't do that. I think it was mostly project management related not technology related or engineering related. They're just having someone overseeing it.

They have a dashboard where you can see how their AI took the call. I think it could actually be a lot better. They give you very basic steps, but they could give you better data. I also think, "Listen, if you're listening and rating your AI calls, why not listen to all calls and give me step statistics?" That's another area they could improve. I think that's it.

**Client**
Great. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
