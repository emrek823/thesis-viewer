# MSSP Navigation Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Finding: ACO success rate has tripled from 26% (2014) to 75% (2024). Navigation → Platform → Risk is working.**

The MSSP program shows clear patterns: larger ACOs with higher quality scores win consistently. The best ACOs have 100% win rates over 9-10 years. This validates that building navigation capabilities, then platform, then taking risk is a repeatable playbook.

| 2016 | 432 | 134 | 31.0% | $691M |
| 2017 | 472 | 159 | 33.7% | $781M |
| 2018 | 548 | 205 | 37.4% | $966M |
| 2019 | 680 | 355 | 52.2% | $1.45B |
| 2020 | 513 | 345 | 67.3% | $2.28B |

| 2024 | 1,428 | 1,075 | **75.3%** | **$12.2B** |

**Key Insight:** 2024 saw massive expansion (3x ACO count) with maintained win rate. The model scales.

## What Predicts ACO Success?

### Size Matters

| Size Bucket | ACO Count | Win Rate | Avg Savings |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Small (<5k beneficiaries) | 48 | 56.3% | $1.3M |
| Medium (5k-15k) | 756 | 73.9% | $3.9M |
| Large (15k-30k) | 339 | 75.2% | $9.0M |
| XLarge (30k+) | 285 | **82.1%** | $21.6M |

**Key Insight:** Scale drives success. XLarge ACOs win 82% of the time vs 56% for small.

### Quality Correlates with Savings

| Quality Score | ACO Count | Win Rate | Avg Savings |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Low (<70) | 114 | 61.4% | $5.6M |
| Medium (70-85) | 723 | 73.4% | $7.8M |
| High (85-95) | 549 | 78.7% | $9.7M |
| Excellent (95+) | 42 | **100%** | $16.0M |

**Key Insight:** Every ACO with 95+ quality score earned savings. Quality is not a trade-off—it's a requirement.

### Winners vs Losers Profile

| Metric | Winners | Losers |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Avg Beneficiaries | 23,046 | 17,575 |
| Avg Quality Score | 82.7 | 79.3 |
| Per Capita Cost | $13,075 | $13,916 |
| Total Savings/Losses | **$12.3B** | -$61M |

**Key Insight:** Winners are larger, higher quality, and lower cost. Losers are smaller with higher per capita costs.

## Top Performers (Cumulative Savings, 3+ Years)

### The All-Stars (100% Win Rate, 9+ Years)

| ACO | Years | Cumulative Savings | Avg Quality |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Mercy Health ACO, LLC | 9 | $445M | 81.8 |
| Privia Quality Network, LLC | 9 | **$387M** | 80.8 |
| Advocate Physician Partners | 10 | $329M | 80.3 |
| Houston Methodist Coordinated Care | 9 | $263M | 84.9 |
| Ochsner Accountable Care Network | 10 | $200M | 83.6 |
| Silver State ACO | 9 | $207M | 78.8 |
| Coastal Carolina Quality Care | 10 | $95M | 86.3 |

### Fast Risers (High Savings Rate, Recent Entrants)

| ACO | Savings Rate | Savings | Quality |
|-----|--------------|---------|---------|
| Citrus County ACO | **22.1%** | $12M | 86.1 |
| Sound Physicians LTC | 20.9% | $84M | 60.7 |
| LTC ACO | 20.2% | $49M | 77.2 |
| USMM Accountable Care | 18.3% | $39M | 54.1 |
| ProHealth Physicians | 17.9% | $18M | 88.3 |
| Aledade Louisiana ACO | 17.4% | $23M | 92.1 |

### Aledade Watch

Aledade ACOs appear **11 times** in top performers:
- Aledade Louisiana ACO (17.4% savings rate)
- Aledade Accountable Care 15, 16, 45, 60, 91
- Aledade Duwamish ACO
- Aledade Arkansas ACO

**Key Insight:** Aledade's model (tech + services for independent practices) is producing consistent results across geographies.

## Worst Performers

| ACO | Loss | Quality | Notes |
|-----|------|---------|-------|
| Sutter Preferred | -$3.4M | 69.3 | Large health system |
| McLaren High Performance | -$3.1M | 85.1 | Despite good quality |
| Arizona Care Network | -$2.8M | 80.6 | |
| Bayview Physician Services | -$1.6M | 79.9 | |
| CVS ACO | -$1.2M | 71.8 | Retail health player |
| Scottsdale Health Partners | -$1.4M | 90.3 | High quality, still lost |

**Key Insight:** Even high-quality ACOs can lose money. Quality alone doesn't guarantee savings—operational execution matters.

## Interpretation for Thesis

### Navigation → Platform → Risk Is Validated

1. **Navigation phase works:** ACOs that start with care navigation capabilities (finding gaps, coordinating care) build the foundation for savings

2. **Platform enables scale:** The 100% win-rate ACOs have built platforms (Privia, Aledade, Caravan) that can replicate success across practices

3. **Risk-bearing is learnable:** Win rates improved from 26% to 75% over 10 years. ACOs learned to manage risk.

4. **Repeatability proven:**
   - Same ACOs winning year after year (Mercy Health: 9/9 years)
   - Platform companies (Aledade, Caravan, Privia) replicating across markets
   - Model works in different geographies (Texas, Ohio, Florida, Louisiana)

### Specialties Implied

While MSSP is primarily primary care focused, the pattern suggests:
- **Primary care** → Proven (MSSP data)
- **Specialty navigation** → Opportunity (apply same playbook)
- **Chronic disease management** → Embedded in ACO success

---

## Startup/Investment Implications

| Opportunity | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| **ACO enablement platforms** | Aledade, Privia, Caravan all winning consistently |
| **Long-term care focus** | Sound Physicians LTC (20.9% savings rate), LTC ACO (20.2%) |
| **Quality improvement tools** | 100% win rate at 95+ quality → quality is the moat |
| **Independent practice aggregation** | Small ACOs struggle (56% win rate) → help them scale |
| **Specialty ACO playbooks** | Take MSSP learnings to oncology, cardiology, nephrology |

### Red Flags

| Pattern | Concern |
|---------|---------|
| Large health systems losing | Sutter, McLaren, CVS — bureaucracy may hurt |
| High quality ≠ guaranteed win | Scottsdale (90.3 quality, still lost) |
| Arizona struggles | Multiple AZ ACOs in losers list |

  - `sav_rate` = savings as % of benchmark
  - `qual_score` = quality score (0-100)
  - `n_ab` = number of assigned beneficiaries

## Next Steps

- [ ] Deep dive on Aledade's model — what's their secret?
- [ ] Compare Privia vs Aledade vs Caravan approaches
- [ ] Map MSSP winners to specialty expansion opportunities
- [ ] Cross-reference with PE roll-up data (are ACO winners acquisition targets?)
