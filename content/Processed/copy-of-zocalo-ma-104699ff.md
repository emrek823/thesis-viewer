MA + the Bottom Line
Focused on pulling the "financial lever"

## Slide 2: MA vs. Other Lines of Business: Higher Margin
### Gross Margins Per Enrollee, 2018-2021
**Chart Data:**
| Category | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |
|:----------------------|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Individual Market | $1,515 | $1,167 | $1,317 | $745 |

## Slide 3: MA: How the $ flows
Zocalo evolution: Vendor to provider
Provider View: $OSH Example
Oak Street Leverages Value-Based Contracts with Medicare Advantage Plans to
Capture the Value Created by Improving Care Quality and Patient Outcomes

1.  Oak Street enters into globally capitated or full risk contracts with MA plans or with CMS (via Direct Contracting) to receive a percentage of each members' monthly premium ("PMPM")
    *   Payments are adjusted on a per patient basis to reflect patient health conditions
    *   OSH data and analytics capabilities increase accuracy, which can be reflected in a higher PMPM
2.  Delivery of the right care in the right setting can greatly impact outcomes and reduce costs associated with ED visits, hospital readmissions and other avoidable high-cost episodes
3.  OSH makes significant investments beyond ordinary primary care in direct patient costs via its comprehensive care model
    *   Investment in welcoming centers, interdisciplinary care teams, purpose-built technology and a differentiated approach to care delivery create the OSH platform
4.  Sustainable, predictable unit economics

## Slide 4: Latino + Health Equity Considerations
Latino + Health Equity
Considerations

## Slide 5: Latino enrollees sign up at higher rates than white enrollees
But these groups tend to be in plans with lower quality plan ratings

**Chart: Percent Enrolled in MA**
| Ethnicity | Percent Enrolled in MA |
|:----------|:-----------------------|
| White | 34% |
| Black | 49% |
| Latinx | 53% |
| Other* | 31% |

"Black, Asian, and Hispanic enrollees sign up at higher rates than white enrollees — but members of racial and ethnic minority groups tend to be in plans with lower quality ratings." - Health Services Research 2023

## Slide 6: Health Equity Index not impacting star ratings until 2027
**Timeline of Measure Changes:**
| Measure Year (MY) | Star Year (SY) | Changes | Key |
|:------------------|:---------------|:--------|:----|
| MY2022 | SY2024 | - Tukey Cutpoint Calculations Codified<br>- Removal of CDC-Nephropathy | Technical Change, Measure Removed |
| MY2023 | SY2025 | | |
| MY2024 | SY2026 | - Removal of Cutpoint Guardrails<br>- Colorectal Cancer Screening age requirement addition (45-49)<br>- Five (5) new HEDIS measures added<br>- Use Continuous Enrollment for Med Adherence denominator inclusion<br>- Apply Improvement measure Hold Harmless to 5-star plans<br>- CAHPS & Administrative measure weights reduced to 2x<br>- Remove Med Rec Post-Discharge as stand-alone measure | Measure Removed, Measure Added, Measure Adjustment, Technical Change, Measure Adjustment, Measure Adjustment, Measure Removed |
| MY2025 | SY2027 | - Health Equity Index Factor replaces Reward Factor | Technical Change |
| MY2026 | SY2028 | - Remove IP/SNF Med Adherence adjustments<br>- Med Adherence measures risk adjusted | Measure Removed, Measure Adjustment |

## Slide 7: Near-term: Unengaged Members Hurt a Plan's Bottom Line
Zocalo has seen XX% of Latino MA members are “unengaged" (e.g., no HRA or AWV in last year)

Unengaged members...
-   Impact the ability to accurately risk adjust patients
-   Reduce quality scores
-   Hurt enrollment and retention of patients (especially for plans outside of the Big 4)

## Slide 8: Appropriate risk adjustment can drive $23K in additional revenue
### Impact of Appropriate HCC Coding on Payment
Female, age 76. Not: originally disabled, Medicaid, ERSD, or institutionalized.

| Major depression disorder, single episode, unspecified | 0 |
| CHF | .323 |
| Asthma | 0 |
| Pressure ulcer of right heel, unspecified | 0 |
| CHF\*DM | .154 |
| **RAF score:** | **1.029** |

## Slide 9: Star ratings drive bonus payments and rebates (1 of 2)
Patient experience and access plays an increasing role in star ratings (57%)

### Relative Weight of Quality Measure Types in MA-PD Star Ratings, %¹
**Chart Data:**
| Measure Type | 2020 (%) | 2021 (%) | 2023 (%) |
|:------------------------------------------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Patient experience and complaint measures | 20 | 24 | 36 |
| Measures capturing access | 12 | 15 | 21 |
| Process measures | 25 | 23 | 17 |
| Intermediate outcome measures | 17 | 18 | 12 |
| Improvement measures | 13 | 12 | 9 |
| Outcome measures | 12 | 7 | 5 |

CMS has proposed an increase in the role of patient experience in MA Star Ratings

**Source:** CMS analysis of Medicare 2020 Part C & D Star Ratings Technical Notes, 2019

## Slide 10: Star ratings drive bonus payments and rebates (2 of 2)
Annual per member bonus payment is $278-$396 and extra annual rebate is $408

5% Quality Bonus for 4-star and above
Plans are required to use the rebate to lower patient cost sharing, lower premiums, or provide additional benefits

### Figure 4: Medicare Advantage Plan Bonuses per Enrollee are Highest for Employer Plans
**Chart Data:**
| Year | Employer Plans ($) | Individual Plans ($) | SNP Plans ($) |
|:-----|:-------------------|:---------------------|:--------------|
| 2015 | ~120 | ~70 | ~100 |
| 2016 | ~160 | ~100 | ~130 |
| 2017 | ~200 | ~140 | ~170 |

| | 3-STAR | 4-STAR |
|:------------------------|:------:|:------:|
| Benchmark | $800 | $800 |
| Quality Bonus | 0% | 5% |
| Benchmark + Quality | $800 | $840 |
| Bid | $750 | $750 |
| Rebate Percentage | 50% | 65% |
| Rebate = Extra Benefits | $25 | $59 |
| Rebate Improvement | n/a | 134% |

## Slide 11: 3 to 4-star rating improvement can drive 8-12% increase in enrollment
"Analysis found that a 1 star increase in rating was associated with an 8 percent to 12 percent increase in beneficiary enrollment in the year following the increase. This increase was independent of overall changes in enrollment (i.e., the change would be in addition to overall county level changes in enrollment)."
- JAMA 2013

**Table: Enrollment & Revenue Impact of Star Rating Increase**
| | 8% INCREASE | 12% INCREASE |
|:--------------------------|:-----------:|:------------:|
| Base Enrollment | 9,600 | 9,600 |
| Total Enrollment Increase | 8% | 12% |
| Estimated New Enrollment | 10,368 | 10,752 |
| Base Rate (Monthly) | $800 | $800 |
| Rate Bonus | 5.0% | 5.0% |
| Rate + Bonus | $840 | $840 |
| Base Revenue (Annual) | $92.16 M | $92.16 M |
| Revised Revenue (Annual) | $104.5 M | $108.4 M |
| Revenue Increase (Annual) | 13.4%/$12M | 17.6%/$16.2M |

$1,250 - $1687 / member annually

## Slide 12: Comparison + Next Steps
### Comparison Table
| Category | Annual per Member $ impact | Comment |
|:---------------|:--------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------|
| Risk Adjustment | $5-$20K | Wide range given dependence on previous conditions |
| Enrollment | $1,250 - $1687 | Independent of overall changes in enrollment |
| Rebate | $408 | $ for extra benefits (which can lead to better quality / enrollment) |
| Bonus | $278-$396 | Differs by type of plan |
