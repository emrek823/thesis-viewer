### Ben Woodington & Coherence Neuro Overview

- Ben moving from Cambridge, UK to San Francisco in 6 weeks
	- Team in both locations
- Background spans drugs to devices
	- Drug discovery → drug delivery → engineering role for patient compliance
	- Developed smart nebulizers tracking lung tidal volume for drug delivery
	- Left when company was acquired by tobacco company (ethical concerns)
	- PhD in neurotech focused on spinal cord injury
	- Developed spine computer interfaces wrapping around spinal cord

### Coherence Neuro - Company & Technology

- Founded 2.5 years ago, raised multiple rounds
	- Currently closing second round of $6M
	- Preparing for Series A next year to fund first clinical study
- Skull-mounted device to monitor and treat brain tumors
	- First in human lined up for November
	- Also working on peripheral applications (pancreatic cancer program)
- Two strong business pillars:
	- Fastest route to adoption for neurotechnologies where surgery already exists
	- Novel approach to oncology treatment
- Next steps:
	- Completing GMP pig work
	- Updating ASIC on their device (collaborating with IMEC)
	- Q1-Q2 2023: Series A to fund 10-patient long-term glioma study

### Market Opportunity & Competitive Positioning

- Targeting glioblastoma treatment initially
	- Standard protocol: surgery (70-80% of patients) → radiotherapy → temozolomide → clinical trials
	- After standard care, patients use Novocure Optune device
- Novocure Optune device as reference point:
	- Non-implanted electrical stimulation system
	- $20,000/month per patient in US ($240,000/year)
	- Reimbursed in US, Germany, Israel, France
	- 10-15% market penetration in US, generating $600M annually
	- Monthly subscription model (reimbursed like a drug)
- Coherence advantage over Novocure:
	- Novocure requires head shaving, causes scalp irritation/blistering
	- Dramatic compliance drop-off impacts survival benefit
	- Coherence’s implantable solution ensures continuous use

### Why Now for Neurotechnology

- Clinical culture changing around implantable devices
	- Neuralink and other companies creating patient/clinician acceptance
	- Scientific tailwinds: intersection of neuroscience and cancer only ~7 years old
	- Patients more open to implantable technologies
- Strategic approach different from other BCI companies
	- Not trying to “take over the world” with broad applications
	- Focused on specific need with clear reimbursement path
	- Designing for compatibility with standard of care (MRI transparency)
	- “Cancer is an accelerant for these technologies” - aim to get long-term chronic human use in under 5 years
