## Summary
A Barrington Orthopedic expert with extensive healthcare industry experience discussed the practice's structure, including 17 physicians, 12 mid-level providers, and four office locations offering various services. They highlighted challenges in the call center, leading to the implementation of AI solutions like Assort for efficiency. Issues related to prior authorizations, scheduling, benefit checks, and the use of athenahealth for RCM were also addressed. The expert praised ClinicalBox for streamlining pre-authorization processes and reducing denial rates significantly. Assort automates around 50% of phone calls, with the rest handled by live agents, resulting in reduced staff through attrition. SIS is used for ASC scheduling and billing, with separate staff managing scheduling. Challenges in ordering medical supplies and implants for the surgery center were discussed, with one person coordinating between multiple vendors.

## Client
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about Healthcare AI. To start off, could you please give me a quick overview of your background and experience?

## Expert
Sure. I've been with Barrington Ortho two different times but back for the last two years. I've been in this crazy healthcare business for north of 40 years, so been around quite a bit, seen a lot of changes, etc. Barrington Orthopedic itself as a practice is 45 years old. We've got 17 physicians and 12 mid-level providers, so PAs and nurse practitioners.

We have four office locations. We have physical therapy and occupational therapy in all four offices and there's about 45 providers between those four offices for PT and OT, and then two MRIs in two of the different locations. A pretty good-sized group, not the biggest in the world, but not the smallest as well.

## Client
Do you guys have ASCs?

## Expert
Yes. We do have a surgery center as well that's part of the group. It's a separate entity to the group, but it's a closed staff. It's only the physicians at Barrington Orthopedics that are allowed to practice there.

## Client
You guys aren't paying salary to your physicians?

## Expert
Yes. We do pay salaries to the docs, but they are on a compensation model that they get a base plus, I call it a bonus, but it's really not it, it's earned income. If they get a base of $500,000 and their revenue that's directly attributable to them after overhead is $1 million, they get $500,000 more. It's a different way.

## Client
Tell me about the problems you guys have on the off-site.

## Expert
The reason we actually turned to the AI component and then Assort, we had some major issues in our call center as far as staffing it. We had huge abandonment rates. We had very long wait times for people that did hang on long enough to talk to a live agent. We were faced with abandonment rates that were under 50%. We needed to do something along those lines. We had been searching for options for our call center. We had a need and really looked at what was going on in the marketplace.

## Client
Yes. If you think about the entire flow from finding a patient to getting the cash from insurance, where are the biggest bottlenecks across that, not just really the scheduling, but in general?

## Expert
Got you. In general, probably our biggest issue once we get past the scheduling side of life, of getting patients into this place, is the pre-authorization process for surgical procedures or any of the ancillaries, whether it be rehab therapy, or MRIs, but mostly on the surgical case side of life. That's where the biggest bottleneck is from a payer perspective. Once you get through that, it's easy.

## Client
What's the average wait time for a prior auth? How is that impacting the business?

## Expert
Yes. Overall, our prior auth process has improved a lot. It used to be up to a week to get prior auth, whether it be for surgery or for the ancillary advanced imaging services. However, we've shortened that down. Now, our average is probably two to three days max. A lot of times, we can get same day, but I'd say on average, it's a couple days. That's our pre-auth processes.

## Client
Yes. How does that impact the scheduling? Do you guys have to build a buffer into that?

## Expert
Yes, we do. If somebody comes in, as an example, and complaining of knee pain, the only way to diagnose what it is, because X-ray is one thing that's easy. It's paid for, there's no prior auth to it. If you need to go to the advanced imaging, if you need an MRI, you can come in today. We might be able to fit you in one of our MRIs and have it done today so you can figure out what the next steps are. We usually have to schedule those patients out at least three to four days if we're going to try to schedule it ahead of time or we have to have a patient call back and schedule it once we get prior auth.

## Client
For the MRI example, are there cases where you know before the visit that they might need an MRI that day, so you're preemptively got the prior auth or does that not happen that often?

## Expert
No. It almost happens very infrequently. Usually, that doctor has to see that patient before they can really figure out what's going on. They're going to do everything they can to diagnose it without having to go to the MRI as the example. The payers really need that documented visit in order to even allow the pre-authorization to proceed.

## Client
Got you. Same day is not really possible?

## Expert
It depends on the payer. That's the issue that goes with it. We know that there are certain payers that there is no prior auth that's needed. If you take a Medicare patient as an example, Medicare doesn't require prior auth for MRI. If we see a Medicare patient at 8:00 A.M. and we can throw them in the scanner because that's the next step at 2:00 P.M., we can do it, but if it's an Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield patient, those all pretty much require prior auth to be done. Again, it depends on the payer. Sometimes it's a day, sometimes it's two, sometimes it's four or five.

## Client
Yes. Do you guys have problems with benefit checks?

## Expert
Yes. Occasionally, we do check eligibility ahead of time. During that eligibility check, we're also querying to see what the benefits really are. Hopefully, it's up to date. Hopefully, its got deductible amounts and copay amounts when we do the benefit check. It depends on who the payer is and the group itself, but for the most part, we do it on every patient that comes through the door.

## Client
Are you guys doing that on the payer portals or through the EMR? Are you calling them?

## Expert
No. We can do it through the payer portal if we need to, but our EMR actually goes out and the practice management system component of our EMR will go out and run eligibility check and be able to gain all of the benefit information if it's available. If it's not available, that's when we may pick up the phone and call or try to go through the portal. Portal is the next step and last is always a phone.

## Client
Yes. What EMR are you guys using?

## Expert
We're on athenahealth.

## Client
How do you like it?

## Expert
We've been out eight years so doing okay with it. We do a lot of development work with them but so for the most part, it's worked out well for us. There's never a great EMR out there. That much, I can tell you. The best one is the next one. They do a good job of staying up-to-date, making sure that everything's enabled correctly so that we can utilize it correctly. Just the way they price their system, which is one of the things I love about athena, is they base it based on collections. The better we do, the better they do. The worse we do, the worse they do. I like the fact that they've got skin in the game.

## Client
Are you guys using them for RCM?

## Expert
Yes. It in a co-sourced relationship, as I like to call it. They do all the easy stuff and we do all the hard stuff. They'll run eligibility, they'll submit claims, they'll post the payments. Anything they can do that's automated, they really do a great job at it. All the hard stuff, which is making sure you've got the right information for the patient, getting that in the system, coding the services that are rendered with the right codes, that kind of stuff all gets done internally. Some of the follow-up portions of the system, we end up doing the process internally just of the nature of orthopedics.

## Client
Is most of that stuff related to coverage and workers comp and multiple insurance and all that stuff?

## Expert
Yes. I was going to say workers' comp is probably the biggest piece of it. Under 15% of our volume is work comp-related. The follow-up and the follow-through on it to be able to get authorization to see that patient, which is done up front, not on the backend, and then making sure you've got authorization to provide whatever services are necessary all take time, and that's a human being that's interacting with the case manager on the work comp side. That's one of the bigger ones. The rest of the stuff would be with the payers, majority of it goes in clean and gets paid quickly. The rest takes all the time to reconcile and work through any issues that are out there.

## Client
Yes. How much staff do you guys have across the call center and RCM?

## Expert
Call center, we right now have four and a half FTEs, so five headcounts, but four and a half FTEs that work the call center for us. On the RCM side of life, we have four coders, two if you want to call customer service folks that are answering billing questions and everything else, and then three people that are working follow up claims. It's a pretty small staff.

## Client
Basically means denial rates?

## Expert
Correct. Either denials, appeals, follow-up to find out where our money's at.

## Client
Got you. Do you guys have other admin staff that are not in either bucket?

## Expert
The whole pre-cert side of life, the pre-authorization side of life?

## Client
Yes.

## Expert
We've got six people that work pre-auth for us.

## Client
Yes. Are they nurses?

## Expert
They are not actually. None of them are nurses. They're all, I want to say trained. They all have some level of clinical skills but they are not nurses. They know how to answer the questions and they know how to get information out of the EMR.

## Client
Have you talked to Assort about doing that or is that not something they're doing?

## Expert
We have not talked to Assort about the pre-cert side of life. We actually use a different AI solution for our pre-authorization process.

## Client
What are you using?

## Expert
It's a company called ClinicalBox.

## Client
Okay. How do you like it?

## Expert
Love them to death to tell you the truth. One of the things that they do is we grant them access to the portals to all the insurance companies so they can get to the medical policies, and then they use their AI to look for if you're trying to prior auth, pre-cert an MRI. It'll go through, search all of the needed information that's needed for the MRI pre-cert and it'll then go through and then search our medical record for all the pertinent information that will make that process easier and get it approved and really puts it on a single page. It pretty much pulls out the necessary information and puts it on a single document is the best way. That's what's sent in to the payers for them to gain prior auth. That's taken our prior auth denials down from something in the mid-teens, which were still pretty good at that point in time. Our prior auths right now, denial rate first time through is less than 10%, which is unheard of in ortho.

## Client
How much are you guys paying ClinicalBox and Assort and athena?

## Expert
Athena is a percentage of collections. Overall, for both the practice management and EMR component to it, we're paying 6 figures a year for that. That's why I love them. It's nice. Again, they've got skin in the game. They tend to do a pretty good job for us. Assort, which we're using only really for the call center right now, we're enhancing that a little bit right now. We're using it for other means to get messages into the EMR. We're paying Assort around $150,000 for their services right now and ClinicalBox less than $60,000.

## Client
What percent of calls is Assort automating?

## Expert
They automate from cradle to grave where they succeed and schedule the patient or reschedule or whatever, probably about 50% of the phone calls that come in through our system, which they handle probably around 3,000 phone calls a month. The rest of the calls that are coming in for scheduling either are routed to our workers comp team, which again goes through a little bit different process because there's interaction with another human being on the other side.

The other ones that they don't handle all the way through get transferred to a live agent, some of which is a patient choice when they're calling in that they don't want to deal with talking to a "robot," even though it's very lifelike talking to them or it could be a language barrier or they just can't understand Assort through their AI, so they'll transfer it to a live person.

## Client
Yes. How do you think about value?

## Expert
Actually I think it's great, to tell you the truth. Our breakeven when we first went with Assort, we were paying less, I say when we first signed the contract, but we've added a couple different services to it, which I can explain in a little bit. Our breakeven was pretty much like one and 1/4 FTEs for one and 1/2 FTEs. When we've gone to and enhanced this and now paying under $150,000 the breakeven, we've already reduced I should say.

## Client
You've already people?

## Expert
Yes. We haven't caught them but through attrition. I wouldn't want to do their job, put it that way, at all. They've got a tough job.

## Client
What else are they doing for you guys?

## Expert
They are now taking phone calls after hours. When our call center shuts down at 5:30 P.M. on weeknights and on weekends when they're not open, a patient can call our main number and actually schedule an appointment. They can do it at 3:00 A.M. They can do it on Sunday afternoon when nobody's there and schedule an appointment for Monday. That's an added benefit so we don't lose patients. We're able to accommodate them whenever they can. If for some reason Assort can't understand them or they can't find the right slot for them, then there's actually a message that gets forwarded to our call center that's waiting for them on Monday morning when they come in and then they can make a phone call out to them. That's one of the few things.

## Client
How is implementation in terms of go live and getting all the rules and preferences?

## Expert
We were actually very smooth. We had a lot of bumps in the roads, but that was not necessarily based on Assort. We had already done a lot of these rules in our physician preferences because we were using an online system off of our website to be able to schedule patients that met certain criteria. We used the template of that with Assort to determine that Dr. Jones wants to only see patients over the age of 30 years old with these 15 conditions and then has a new patient slot or return patient follow-up patient slot available to them, depending on the type of patient, whether they have been here before or not. The implementation itself, from the time I signed the contract to the time we went live was about three and a half weeks.

After that, of course we had to tweak it and we tweaked the questions that got asked by Assort to the patient. We also had to clean up some of the stuff that was actually probably wrong on our online scheduling template as well. Cleaned all of that up over the next really couple of months of just tweaking it here, tweaking it there, continue to get better literally every day. The implementation was very smooth.

## Client
Makes sense. On the ASC side, are you guys using software like SIS or HST there?

## Expert
Yes. We use SIS.

## Client
Yes. How do you like it?

## Expert
It's good. It fits the needs of our surgery center. It's relatively small. The reporting coming out of SIS is a little not as robust as something like HST has got, but it's also half the price. For the basics of ASC scheduling and billing and documenting in the EMR and everything else, it works just absolutely fabulously for us.

## Client
Yes. How much are you guys paying them?

## Expert
We don't pay them a lot. I want to say over $50,000 a year.

## Client
The scheduling is separate from athena scheduling?

## Expert
Yes. Within SIS, it is separate from athena scheduling, yes.

## Client
Who's doing the scheduling, your call center team?

## Expert
No. We actually have a separate staff for our ASC because it's a separate entity in and of itself. It almost has to function like it was an open ASC to anybody that wanted to schedule a case there. We have separation of church and state when it comes to the ASC. We have surgical schedulers on the physician side that are booking surgery cases and they have got parameters to work in.

They know when block time is available for certain physicians, and so they will send those requests up now via paper, believe it or not, to the staff that we have got at the ASC, which is really probably one FTE person that will schedule that patient in on the correct day with the correct surgery with all of the physician preferences that are needed for that case. It's a little bit different.

## Client
You have like 1% doing all that? For all the auths and benefits that's done on the central team, it is only people from your.

## Expert
Exactly. As a matter of fact, we're in the process right now of working with athena and SIS to incorporate a true HL7, at least demographic interface between the two systems. Right now, when John Doe needs to get scheduled in SIS, even though I might have been seen on the practice side at Barrington Ortho, to be done at the surgery center, they pretty much have to enter everything in from scratch, name, date of birth, address and everything else. We're working through that interface process right now to get rid of that inefficient process itself.

## Client
Yes. Would you say there are operations problems in the surgery center?

## Expert
I wouldn't say there are really any real problems. The process itself is pretty good. There are definitely inefficiencies between things that could be done better. Probably the biggest hang up that we have with the surgery center, biggest problem that I think we continue to work on is ordering medical supplies and especially the implants that are needed because we're dealing with multiple vendors, because we're not like a single vendor, single manufacturer.

We're pretty agnostic for our docs, depending on what the needs are and what the surgery type is. Our materials manager that works on the surgery center side has her hands full when one of our hand surgeons wants implants from Arthrex and one wants it from Acumed and another one wants it from Synthes. She's trying to coordinate all of that.

## Client
You have one person doing that too?

## Expert
Yes. It is not her full-time job. She spends probably half to 3/4 of her time doing that.

## Client
Great. This was helpful. Thank you for your time. Enjoy the rest of your day.
