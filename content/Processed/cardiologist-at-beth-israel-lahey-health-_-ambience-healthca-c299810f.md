### Summary
The Tegus Client and the expert discussed the use of various scribing solutions in healthcare, such as Abridge, SmarterDx, and Ambience, highlighting the importance of specificity in ICD-10 coding for billing opportunities. The expert mentioned the advantages of SmarterDx in capturing detailed information for accurate coding and maximizing reimbursement, as well as the potential future where scribing tools could become intelligent enough to eliminate the need for SmarterDx. They also touched on the potential advantages of SmarterDx in capturing downstream information related to insurance decisions and precedents, as well as the hospital's leaning towards using Ambience for scribing solutions in cardiology due to its accurate risk assessments for high-risk patients.

**Client**
Thank you for taking the time. Really appreciate it.

**Expert**
Yeah, no worries.

**Client**
Just to kick things off, to give some context, we are researching the healthcare space, but are particularly interested in solutions like Ambience AutoScribe, Abridge, and SmarterDx, so both across scribing and clinical documentation improvement automation. Maybe to kick things off, it'd be helpful to understand which of these solutions you've tried versus, like, which of them you're currently using in your role.

**Expert**
As mentioned, I tried most of them. We're our healthcare system and our current practice is in a position where we're just trying a different number of these. I have tried Nabla, I have tried Corti, I have tried Abridge and SmarterDx. We're in the cardiology space. We've used a lot of the scribing solutions, the generative AI, mainly for note writing and documentation because that is obviously a big burden that in the healthcare field, experience on a daily basis.

**Client**
Got it. In your current practice, are you using any of the scribing solutions actively?

**Expert**
We're using SmarterDx right now.

**Client**
Are you using SmarterDx, but are you not using Nabla, or Corti, or Abridge? Any of the ones that do the ambient listening?

**Expert**
Not actively right now, no. We had used them in the past, just trial them.

**Client**
Got it. Maybe to kick things off, it would be really helpful to just go through each of the scribing solutions that you have used before and just walk through any pros or cons or any differences that they had between each other.

**Expert**
Yeah, sure. Where do you want to start?

**Client**
Let's kick off with the most popular one, Abridge.

**Expert**
Okay. We use that for several months for billable notes, just streamlining our workflow. It did streamline. I think pros are we use Epic. It did integrate into Epic very well. I think overall, the generative notes that it provided were fairly accurate. With this one, as with a lot of them, when you have a conversation with a patient, there is a lot of nuance, there's a lot of need for redirecting patients, and I think sometimes, these notes picked up and maybe added some things. Not that some of these things that it included were inappropriate.

I think sometimes patients find themselves wanting to discuss things that are beyond the scope of cardiac care. The stuff that was generated was certainly accurate, but just was maybe superfluous. Maybe just unnecessarily added due to the context of this, me being in a more specialized field of medicine.

**Client**
Got it. I'm curious, why did you choose to turn off Abridge or stop using it after you tried it?

**Expert**
I think we're still in a position. Obviously this space is, as you well know, there's a lot out there. I don't think we've put our final nickel down on what, where we want to remain with. I think still for us, the jury's still out. We wanted to give it a trial, but we also wanted to see what other options we had before we commit.

**Client**
will say that makes sense. To just give a bit of context, how large is the hospital or health system that you work with?

**Expert**
It's big. I work at one of the community hospitals. It's about a 250-bed hospital. The health system itself is multi-hospital. It's a regional hospital system, so thousands of hospital beds.

**Client**
Got it. When the decisions are made for something like Abridge or SmarterDx, is that made on a hospital level or is that made on the health system level?

**Expert**
Yeah, good question. It would be made on the hospital level in our case. Obviously we would have to give a very good cost benefit argument for us using it. This isn't necessarily something that would be adopted system wide per se, but I think just given some of the heterogeneity of our hospital system and different hospitals catering to different things, this would be more, as it currently stands, just hospital based. Yeah.

**Client**
That makes sense.

**Expert**
It's possible the majority of where we're using this is predominantly in the outpatient setting right now, rather than inpatient, if that makes sense.

**Client**
Yep. Just to be clear, so one hospital in your health system could use Abridge, another one could use Ambience, another one could use Corti, and they don't need to consolidate across the whole system.

**Expert**
As it stands right now, this is a very big system. It's not something that I can speak for some of the bigger hospitals. I think in theory that could be. Obviously this is a very fluid space right now. I think our current group is working on options and solutions that work for our group. I think as this evolves this will probably be something that will need to be addressed from a regional standpoint, from a hospital wide system. As it currently stands, that's not the case, but I do see that as being something we'll have to address down the road.

**Client**
Super helpful. I guess to just keep going on the scribing point, could you maybe talk about Ambience next?

**Expert**
The areas that I just mentioned?

**Client**
Yeah, in the after-visit summaries and referral letters. If it was pretty noticeable, what were some of the differences?

**Expert**
I would say just the level of detail probably with Ambience was maybe a little bit better. I think those are important things. I think the referral, the after-visit summary, certainly important. I think that probably the actual meat of these things being the clinical note and the clinical documentation. I would probably say Abridge was better, was probably more detailed, was probably more thorough in the cardiac space. It had a little bit more specificity with terms of abnormal heart rhythm diagnoses and ischemic heart disease diagnoses. Abridge was probably a little bit more specific in terms of capturing true ICD-10 specificity codes.

**Client**
Super helpful. Just to be clear, when you say that it captures the ICD-10 codes, as it's taking the notes, it will put the code for whatever kind of diagnosis it believes is accurate in your chart?

Exactly.

**Client**
Got it. Ambience or Abridge captures the ICD-10 code, puts it in your chart, and then SmarterDx, after you've already finished your chart, is going to check over those ICD-10 codes?

**Expert**
Correct.

**Client**
Is that accurate?

**Expert**
That is accurate.

**Client**
Great. Why do you need SmarterDx if Ambience and Abridge are already doing this ICD-10 coding for you? Is it just that they aren't always 100% accurate or they sometimes miss possibilities for upcoding? It would be helpful to understand.

**Expert**
I think that's a big part of it. I think there's lots of billing opportunities on both the inpatient and outpatient side that are lost due to, again, I'll say specificity of ICD-10 codes. We could say the patient has coronary disease, but if we're not saying what territory of coronary disease, and do they have revascularization, I think SmarterDx provides an additional level.

Frankly, I think all of these solutions are trying to avoid burnout and streamline efficiency. When I go through and I'm having to click on multiple different boxes to further specify patients' diagnoses, some of this is a time-saving effort. I think what the physician is doing at the point of care, sometimes it's three or four more clicks can be the difference of thousands of dollars and more in reimbursement. I think that we realize that the hospital realizes that. I think something like SmarterDx, probably provides that additional, I'll keep saying specificity to be able to appropriately up bill where necessary, and capture the complexity of patients.

**Client**
Got it. Theoretically, if these scribing solutions were able to code these ICD-10s very accurately, do you think there's ever a world in which you no longer need SmarterDx? Do you think it's realistic for Ambience?

**Expert**
I think it's very realistic, yeah. That's where I think all of these different solutions, it's a matter of road testing them and seeing how well they perform. There's lots of overlap in terms of what they offer and perform, but they're nuanced, for sure.

**Client**
Super helpful. I think one of the big questions we're trying to ask ourselves is, how likely is it that something like SmarterDx is no longer necessary if the scribing tools become really, really intelligent or become really good at coding? If you have any more color on how realistic you think that is, how difficult of a challenge it is to get the ICD-10 coding accurate in something like Abridge or Ambience, that'd be super helpful.

**Expert**
From a technical standpoint, in terms of how these are able to generate what they generate, they're reviewing the patient's medical record, they're being able to comb appropriate data. I think that that's a technical question that each of these teams like, "Sure," are striving to do. They want to be as comprehensive and complete as possible.

If they can provide all of the necessary detail, complexity capturing, and appropriately coding, especially in this day and age with bundled payments and things like that, there are really are lots of reimbursable dollars that aren't being captured by that. I can't say, from a technical standpoint, why Abridge or Ambience can't do this. I'm sure that this is something that is ripe for investigation and further capturing.

**Client**
Got it. I think it'd also be helpful to quickly touch on Corti and Nabla, which you have tried as well, and just comparing those to Ambience. Just quickly, on that last point, is there anything from just a conflict of interest or regulatory patient data protection standpoint where the scribes moving into SmarterDx's lane has any sort of conflict, or that there's nothing, you can't imagine any issues there?

**Expert**
Not that I can imagine. I can't really foresee a conflict of interest there. I think that these are trying to generate through patient interview, through patient history, through the patient medical record, what they see as appropriate diagnoses. These are things that are, to a certain extent, making some interpretation of test results, making risk assessments of these patients. I don't think, obviously, they're not going to be flawless every time. I think that it's going to take the physician reviewing the record and amending as appropriate. I don't see any conflicts there that immediately come to mind. Does that help?

**Client**
Yeah. Super helpful. Actually, before we move onto other scribing solutions, I'm curious, have you tried any clinical decision support technologies like Regard, or Glass Health, or anything like that?

**Expert**
I have not. No.

**Client**
Got it. Do you have any opinion on those kinds of solutions that just read your chart, and try to prompt you if you're missing anything in the patient, as you're writing down your notes with the patient?

**Expert**
Yeah. I think all of these things we're trying to strike a balance. We want to cover everything and be as thorough as possible, but we don't want to do that at the cost of really verbose, long notes. These are, ultimately, notes that people have to read. You can certainly have levels of that. There are certainly things that every doctor has in mind, depending on the specialty, that are things that are not to miss.

In our specialty, as a cardiologist, we don't want to miss heart attacks. We don't want to miss aneurysms. We don't want to miss pulmonary embolism. Those are some diagnoses that can have significant and immediate health consequences on people. Do I think that prompts for those could be appropriate? I suppose. Those are pretty rare that we're not thinking about those, but then there are more nuanced, less critical diagnoses, less critical questions that might, on occasion, prompt us. Doctors are human, they make mistakes and forget things.

I think that there certainly could be something that could prompt us to think about additional things. I guess, I would have to try it to really see if how much it's helping me versus is it already saying things that are in the medical world, maybe low-yield, or maybe not immediately important? We got to sift through that. I would have to try to really make a further opinion on it.

**Client**
That's totally fair. Thinking about these three solutions where you have your CDI coding, you have your scribing, and then clinical decision support, which you haven't tried, but have an idea of. As a doctor, what is most important to you? What saves you the most time? If you could only have one of these things, what would you prefer you have at the hospital?

**Expert**
Talking to me, it's probably the scribe. As doctors, the reality is we spend time with our patients, but I spend much more time looking at a computer every day and documenting. It's the medico-legal world that we live in. Documentation is, oftentimes, the bane of our existence. If you were to talk to maybe one of the hospital administrators, they may be saying maybe a CDI support tool to further capture all the billable dollars that doctors are missing due to whether it's button fatigue or what have you in terms of capturing all these diagnoses. I would probably say, clinical scribe as it stands right now, for me.

**Client**
Got it. Today, are you still using a clinical scribe today? I know you mentioned you tried Abridge, you tried Ambience, you tried a couple others. If you had a visit today, what scribe would you use, if any?

**Expert**
We most recently were using Ambience.

**Client**
Got it. Is that just like a trial, similar to how you're trying Abridge for a couple months, or are you planning to just use Ambience now?

**Expert**
It's a trial.

**Client**
Great. I think it'd be helpful to go over the other two scribing solutions that you tried now, Nabla and Corti, and then we can circle back, and talk about Ambience, and your scribe decision in more detail. If you could start with maybe Corti, that'd be super helpful.

**Expert**
We used Corti a few months ago. Actually and uniquely, we use this in the inpatient setting. It was a little bit different maybe from some of the other ones that we've used being predominantly outpatient. We use the coding and scribe system that they offer. We basically generate inpatient follow-up and consultation notes for patients that were hospitalized. I felt like it was fairly good, fairly accurate.

Sometimes, there are some prompts that I noticed with Corti where it was maybe asking some maybe obvious questions that I think were important, but were a little bit of a waste of time. These are trying to triage patients, like asking, "Is the patient breathing?" It's like, "Well, I wouldn't be using an AI scribe at the current time if the patient wasn't breathing." It needed some explicit input to derive the patient acuity, if that makes sense. There's a small detail. Sometimes, they're intelligent triage, I think they called it, were a little bit basic, I'll say.

**Client**
Super helpful. Corti, I think when they advertise online, that's their main differentiator, is the prompting. It is helpful to get any feedback around that. I'd be curious why you use Corti primarily in an inpatient setting, whereas, you don't use the others in the inpatient setting?

**Expert**
That's a great question. Between myself and my partners, that's how we decided to trial this. I think that there are significant differences. It would be nice to be able to test both, all of these on the inpatient and outpatient setting. I think the way that our system is set up and with my other colleagues, that's how we ultimately settled on it. I wish I could give you a better answer. It would be nice to more standardize this in terms of how we're using this, but that just is how it laid out for us.

Got it. Can SmarterDx review any codes from inpatient visits?

**Expert**
It can, yep.

**Client**
Helpful. As we think about whether or not SmarterDx will be taken over by the scribes, or the scribes are going to move down into SmarterDx's space. In the inpatient setting, it's not like you're always talking to the patient for all the codes that you're writing down, I assume. Are there things that something like Corti or Ambience is just going to miss in terms of coding that wouldn't be able to correct those? Would SmarterDx be necessary in the inpatient setting even if Ambience and Abridge got really, really good at ICD-10 coding?

**Expert**
I think that's a good question. In terms of some medical reimbursements and bundled payments, I think that that is probably more relevant to something like SmarterDx on the inpatient side than the outpatient side, because somebody admitted with a heart attack or a myocardial infarction is going to get a bundled payment versus if we capture additional ICD-10 codes or complications of that hospitalization, that can significantly increase reimbursement. I think that SmarterDx is, I'll say maybe overall, slightly more valuable on the inpatient side.

**Client**
Could you dig into that a little bit deeper, what these bundled payments are, and why SmarterDx is more valuable inpatient?

**Expert**
CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid, lots of times, now, somebody admitted to the hospital, there are groups of diagnoses. Not everybody is admitted with the same thing, but somebody admitted with pneumonia, the government has decided "Okay, if somebody has a bacterial pneumonia, we're going to pay a hospital $10,000 for that hospitalization." Just as a rough number.

As doctors and nurses and healthcare providers, I think rightly so, sometimes we order too many tests. That's the bane of sometimes the medical healthcare system. I think the attempts of CMS to do this are to say, "As the hospital, you're going to get paid $10,000. All the testing that you do is going to come out of that $10,000 in payment. We want you to provide appropriate care, but without going over the top."

Now, somebody with just bacterial pneumonia, say, it's complicated by them needing to be intubated, and put on a ventilator, and put in the ICU. That's going to increase that code. In our world, we can just call somebody who's low on oxygen, we can call it hypoxemic respiratory failure, but we have to say what it's secondary to. We have to give all of these reasons for why this patient is sicker than somebody who just has run-of-the-mill pneumonia.

I don't know if I'm explaining that well, but the point is that we have to try to be as specific as possible. Sometimes, we're trying to make the patient appropriately so complex to capture to say, "Hey, this person is very sick. We're using a lot of resources from our hospital to treat this patient." CMS looks at the medical record. Now, if I just say pneumonia, but the patient spent time in the ICU and they are on a ventilator, the hospital may only get a certain level of payment, whereas, the complexity of their hospital stay was much, much more complex than that.

**Client**
That is a super helpful explanation. I really appreciate it. In this case, SmarterDx is basically able to capture, I'm assuming, information from your EHRs, from your charts to get you the highest payment possible. Would it be safe to say that these ambient listening tools wouldn't be able to do the same? I mean, if someone comes in with pneumonia or they have a big issue, not everything that you say is going to be translating to the codes. It's more just what people are putting in the charts or what's already in the EHR?

**Expert**
Exactly.

**Client**
Super helpful. Just on that last point, I'm completely with you, and I think it's a critical point that the ambient scribes are not capturing everything that would be necessary to do coding right. That leaves this continued opportunity for the SmarterDxes of the world.

What is SmarterDx getting access to? What information do they have or connections to? What sort of data sources enable them to just be structurally better or more likely to outperform than scribe vendors? Is it just "Hey, that's where they're focusing and the scribe vendors are focusing on something else, so SmarterDx is just stronger at having built that muscle"? Is there any structural advantage that they have?

**Expert**
My guess is what SmarterDx is pulling for or pulling from is probably more of the medical record looking for example, again, we'll say pneumonia, pulling from the record to see word like the level of high flow oxygen, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, things like that. These are all things that us, as doctors, should we click on this patient has pneumonia? We're clicking on, again, these additional qualifiers to further specify what the patient's condition is. My presumption is, SmarterDx is drawing from all of those action words I'll say to appropriately capture the level of acuity of a patient.

**Client**
Understood. That makes a lot of sense on how they're doing it. My question on top of that is, is there anything that structurally puts SmarterDx at an advantage to do this versus the ambient listening tools? Meaning, my sense is on what you just said, that the ambient listening tools also have access to the electronic health record.

Okay. the same access to information upstream. Is there anything further downstream that could be advantageous to SmarterDx? Let's just take it at face value, unless you correct me that upstream, the data access to properly code, everyone is on the same page. Actually, you'd argue, potentially, that the scribe is in a better position in that they have all the information from the ambient scribe of which SmarterDx is going to capture some synopsis, or note, or portion of it that gets into the medical record. Everyone has a medical record.

Again, you'd argue the scribes, structurally, just in a better position from a data access standpoint. One argument could be for SmarterDx, is that they have better information downstream. Meaning, they're capturing the feedback loop on what claims are denied, how quickly claims are moving through, what the nuances around payout rates from the payers.

They're actually basically getting the result and the final answer. One, is that true? Two, are the passive scribes getting the closed loop answer as well? Meaning, the outcome of we put in this code, we actually got reimbursed, or didn't. That could be an advantage for SmarterDx, in that, they're getting information further downstream.

**Expert**
That's a great question. Off the top, I don't know. The thing I'll say is, that the insurance, I think that's a really good point you bring up in terms of how insurances derive these questions, and how they derive payments, and how they approve, and deny claims. That is an incredibly sloppy and heterogeneous space where we deal with dozens of different insurance companies, all with different nuances in terms of what medications, and what things are listed on their prescription list, and what things they cover, they don't, and what passes they have in terms of "We have to try this before this."

I think that's a great point. I suspect that SmarterDx may have some access to, you're right, downstream insurance decisions and precedents that allow them to revert back to saying, "Here's what we should call this. Here is going to be our greatest chance of success for whatever diagnosis-related group we're trying to capture, and whatever level of complexity, and reimbursement we're trying to capture." I suspect that

SmarterDx may have something on that.

**Client**
I don't know the answer. My sense is that they probably have that downstream structural advantage today. The question of whether or not that's durable, meaning can the Ambiences or Abridges of the world also get access to that information? I don't know, but if SmarterDx is getting access to it, then I don't know why not, why they wouldn't be willing to share with somebody else who's also providing similar value

**Expert**
Exactly. Here's what I'll say, is many times, especially in the outpatient setting, this is the kind of game we play. I know that a patient needs a medication and they have Blue Cross Blue Shield. Sometimes, you just have to look for what each of these companies are looking for. It's not like I'm fabricating things, but sometimes you have to play the game of what the note has to say. "Oh, we've been down this road before. Last time I tried it with this patient, it was declined for this reason. Let's articulate, use some acrobatics a little bit, and it'll get approved."

If a scribe system or a SmarterDx system could come to the table with that ability to do that, here's what I'll say is, these insurance companies also, they are moving targets too. I look at the GLP-one space right now, which are all these weight loss drugs. Everybody wants to be on them. I am a proponent of them. I think that they're generally a good thing for people who are incredibly overweight. I'm finding now that people who have been on these for several years now, now, the landscape of how the insurance companies are interpreting the need for these is changing. People are having them all declined.

**Client**
An AI tool to be able to anticipate "Okay, what are the new steps that these insurance companies are asking for prior to patients need to be approved of these?" A lot of these, they're frustrating, but they're appropriate. "Oh, the patient needs to be in a weight management plan for six months. They need to have dietary and nutrition assessments for six months." I think there are appropriate steps for the overall well-being of these patients. As a doctor, they're a pain in the ass. An AI tool that could anticipate and see how each of these companies are transitioning, these would be very helpful.

Interesting. Maybe just closing out this part of the thread. Who do you think is more structurally well-positioned to move horizontally across this full stack, all the way from ambient scribe, care decision-making, down into the depths of RCM? Everyone's going to try to expand outward over time and capture more surface area. Would you rather come at it from the position of the scribe starting point or from the SmarterDx starting point?

**Expert**
That's a good question. It's probably a technical question. I would say, based on what I know about these, that I would rather be in the space of the SmarterDx. I think that that probably has a lot more layers of integration that they've already captured. I'm not saying that the scribe certainly is trivial, but I think that the ability to do natural language processing and to process clinical notes, I see that as being, in this space, maybe one of the easier things that can be done.

Again, I'm not the technical side of this, but I think SmarterDx maybe captures a little bit more of the deeper layers of insurance integration, interpretation, precedent interpretation, previous case comparison that maybe some of these scribes haven't yet captured or haven't captured. They're capturing, as we said, what is taking place in a conversation between the doctor and the patient which, as you alluded to, much, much of what happens in terms of medical decision-making. A lot of that happens deeply beyond that conversation alone.

**Client**
Super helpful. I'm curious if you could give a breakdown of how much of this coding is happening in an inpatient setting where maybe Ambience or Abridge won't capture versus how much is happening outpatient, where Ambience is probably capturing 90% of it. Do you have a rough sense of what the spend

breakdown would be?

**Expert**
I don't, honestly. I don't even know if I could venture a guess. I think individually is what we're doing as doctors. The majority of my work, personally, is outpatient. I do probably 70% outpatient, 30% inpatient. Taking into account that it's a larger workload in the outpatient setting, it's really hard to say. I don't even know if I could guess.

**Client**
No worries at all. Another question on Max's earlier point, it sounds like for you, having tried all these solutions, would it be safe to say that they're relatively commoditized, they aren't super differentiated from each other on the scribing side?

**Expert**
Agreed. Yeah. I think they're pretty close.

**Client**
If your hospital or health system really wants to consolidate solutions and SmarterDx launched a scribe, and the scribe launched a version of SmarterDx, which one do you think you would be more likely to stick with?

**Expert**
Like I said, I would be inclined to probably go with more of SmarterDx. I think that these spaces, it depends on how rapidly they can evolve. Your guess is as good as mine. I mean, SmarterDx could launch a scribe and be pretty comprehensive, but each of these other solutions could catch up, could be more innovative. I think, as it stands right now, with the resources that they each have, probably SmarterDx.

**Client**
Got it. Going back to just comparing the scribes, I'm curious which way you're leaning. You've tried now Abridge, Ambience, Corti, and Nabla. Actually, we didn't go over Nabla. If you have any quick notes on that, if there's anything that differentiates Nabla from the other ones, that would be helpful.

**Expert**
Not really, honestly. I was just racking my brain thinking about that one. I don't have anything notable. I think it's good. I think it was accurate and timely. I think it would generate the notes very quickly. It, obviously, integrated very nicely into Epic, which is what we use. Nothing else super notable, to be honest.

**Client**
All good. Having tried all four of these, which way do you think your hospital is leaning for a scribing solution?

**Expert**
Probably Ambience, if I had to say. I mean, this is going to be a decision that's going to be based on a lot of those shareholders, a lot of the doctors involved, of my colleagues who I've spoken to. I think that's probably the one that we're leaning towards.

**Client**
Got it. Do you know why you're leaning towards Ambience versus something like Abridge?

**Expert**
That's a good question. Specifically within our field, within cardiology, it has been able to give some really, I think, good and accurate risk assessments. I think that something like our field, something like cardiology, which it's maybe a little bit more of a high-risk field than say something like urology or gastroenterology. I think that we've found that it's been good about capturing that risk assessment for us.

Here's what I'll say. If you make a mistake or you miss something as a gastroenterologist, in our field, it can be life and death. Missing something on an EKG, missing something on a stress test, or patient symptoms that maybe you didn't take as seriously as you should have. I think that cardiology, the stakes are higher. We've found that it's been good and appropriate about, I'll say, having a conservative level of risk capturing such that we're not letting a sick patient fall to the cracks.

**Client**
Got it. Just to clarify for us, could you explain the difference between this risk assessment versus just the standard charting that Abridge does, which you said was potentially more accurate than Ambience? I'm just trying to understand where Ambience is or what this risk assessment actually is.

**Expert**
There are lots of different tools for risk factor assessments. Lots of them have been clinically validated. I don't think Ambience has their own proprietary risk factor assessment. I think that Ambience is pulling from things like I can list a bunch of them. RCRI, NSQIP, there's a lot of different ones that we use, whether it's for, what is somebody's risk of having a heart attack tomorrow, within the next year, five years? What's the risk of somebody having a complication during surgery?

I was globally saying that it's good about capturing and assigning a level of risk to these patients that, as a cardiologist, oftentimes, we're being asked, what is this patient's risk of having something bad happen during a surgery they have next week? I think that Ambience has been particularly good about helping us capture that or appropriately labeling the risk of a patient. Does that make sense?

**Client**
I see. It processes through all the notes that you've taken, and then it gives you a risk assessment for the patient.

**Expert**
Exactly.

**Client**
Do all the scribes provide this risk assessment, or is this something that only Ambience does?

**Expert**
They do. They all give assessments. This is based globally. This is based on smoking history, previous heart history, EKGs, all the cardiac testing. They all do. Ambience, I'll say, it's been maybe a little bit different, maybe a little bit better anecdotally, on what my use of it so far.

**Client**
Super helpful. Just one more question. You mentioned that for the cardiac team, it seems like you're leading Ambience versus others. Do you think this is something that will standardize across the entire system, or do you think it'll fragment across specialties?

**Expert**
That's a great question. I think what that'll depend on is, as you look at each subspecialty in medicine, they all have their own governing bodies, their own guidelines, their own recommendations, their own expert opinions. It's going to matter in terms of, if you look at something like oncology, a lot of these spaces are moving so fast. It's really going to matter in terms of how quickly and efficiently these systems are keeping up with a lot of these changes.

That could be different. I think that it's entirely possible that some of these could emerge as "Oh, they're a strength in oncology, but they're less so in cardiology" and vice versa. Certainly, theoretically possible. Again, medicine is incredibly specialized, and subspecialized these days, and very heterogeneous in terms of different interests, and different guidelines, and recommended testing, and risk assessment. I think, to your

point, it's certainly possible it could fragment.

**Client**
I'm probably stating the obvious, but I'd assume more fragmentation at the scribe layer is better for SmarterDx, and that I'm imagining the billing, and the RCM side of your system is a lot more centralized and standardized?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
Got it. I'm curious how you thought about price for these scribing solutions as well. Were they all similar prices? Let's say Nabla offered you a significantly cheaper price than Ambience. Do you think that it's a good enough solution that you would go with that, or are you guys relatively price-intensive?

**Expert**
It's a good question. Obviously, I would like to say that price is, unfortunately, something we definitely have to think of. I think it's a really good question of, are some of these solutions good enough if the price is a lot cheaper? I would honestly probably say, at this point, yes. If one came in significantly lower for, say, some long-term commitment or, whatever, duration of period of time we commit to this. If one came in considerably lower, I think it would be, certainly, a compelling reason. I think these are all going to be very evolving and fluid.

I don't think that we would want to commit ourselves to something long term over the course of five, 10 years because I think this space is going to look very different even then. For a year, I think it is certainly something that we would think about, may not be the top one that we want, but if we got it cheaper, we might take it.

**Client**
Super helpful. I'd love to just touch on Epic. Epic is the 800-pound gorilla in the room. They have the opportunity to move into either scribing or SmarterDx space. Just as a doctor who's worked with Epic for a long time, what do you think the likelihood that they're able to create product there?

**Expert**
That's a great question. I think they're still a privately owned company. I think they certainly are the standard. That's a great question. I think, in terms of them having the access that they have in terms of the medical record, they've already been very good about linking all of our hospitals. I think that should they do that, and I don't know the legality of this, being able to limit other scribes or other systems from integrating with their system. I think that could be quite a power move if they were looking into that, which I wouldn't be surprised if they were.

**Client**
I'm not sure if this is true, I've heard that all doctors can see in the Epic portal they have some roadmap. Is that something that you've seen before? Roadmap to what, specifically? I've just heard that the Epic portal has a product roadmap in it sometimes. I'm just curious if that is anything you've ever seen before. It may not be accessible.

**Expert**
I'm not sure what that is.

**Client**
Got it. Is there anything that these scribes could do that would make them significantly stickier, significantly differentiated from each other, in your view?

**Expert**
The only other thing I'll say is, I think, as a doctor, the more you get experience as a doctor, the more you realize how much medicine is an art as much as a science. There are the textbook things that we should all do that if you look up a patient with this age, with these symptoms, with such and such symptoms and concerns, here's the test you should do.

There are lots of other psychosocial, mental health, family goals of care, decisional changes that need to be made that I'm not sure that these solutions clearly capture all that right now. That's where somewhat of this art of medicine comes into play. I'm not saying that it's unachievable. I don't think that those kind of decisions are there yet, but that's something that I wouldn't be surprised if it's much better capturing in five or 10 years.

**Client**
Super helpful. It's interesting, we've spoken to a few people. It seems like the consensus is there isn't a ton of differentiation between all of the scribing players and yet, Abridge is by far the most popular. I'm curious, why you think it is that Abridge has managed to dominate the market so far. If you think that's something that's going to continue to persist for a while, or if you think the market is going to fragment soon?

**Expert**
It's a good question. I think Abridge has been very good about their marketing, and I think that it certainly is one of the more well-known ones. I can't say that I've had a lot of discussions with colleagues in other spaces, in other hospital systems that have used, and trialed all these different ones. I think it's a testament to them getting their marketing out there.

It's a great question. Do I think that it's head and shoulders above all the others in terms of what I've seen so far? It's good. I don't know why they're leading the pack so far, to be honest, but I wouldn't say that it is, in my opinion, that much better than some of the other ones I've seen, from when it really boils down to the nuts and bolts of what these do.

**Client**
