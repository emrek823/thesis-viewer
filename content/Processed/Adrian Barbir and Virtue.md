### Adrian’s Background & Company Journey

- Co-founder at Doe (stealth mode startup)
- Previous experience building and selling company that reached $100k monthly revenue by month 4
- Former Brain Trust employee (infra/dev tools company)
- UCLA graduate, grew up in Houston
- Met co-founder through Zellows network, worked together for 2+ years

### Doe’s Market Focus & Thesis

- Targeting modern DSOs (Dental Service Organizations) with AI-powered operations platform
- Core problem: DSOs struggle with basic analytics due to fragmented systems
	- Example: Determining most profitable procedure takes 3-4 weeks of manual data matching
	- Multiple practice management systems create data silos
- Solution: LLM-powered data unification providing instant insights and actionable charts
- Considering expansion beyond dental as PE groups express interest for portfolio companies

### Current Traction & Metrics

- Started coding July 1, began selling at Daikuma conference (August 6)
- Live customer: 25-location DSO in pilot phase
- Signed contracts: 130-location DSO + 500-location DSO (rolling out in 2-3 weeks)
- Pipeline: ~$20M across 20+ prospects in 2nd-4th demo calls
- Current YC batch, Demo Day September 9th

### Market Insights & Challenges

- Surprising finding: Everyone wants AI but lacks clear implementation strategy
- Industry executives discuss AI strategy without actionable specifics
- Opportunity exists for thought leadership on AI best practices in dental
- Long sales cycles typical for dental industry

### Next Steps

- Adrian to send pitch deck and broader vision memo
- Virtue team will review materials and follow up
- Fundraising: $3M at $30M valuation, $1.2M raised so far, targeting completion by Demo Day
