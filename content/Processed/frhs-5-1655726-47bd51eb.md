**Background:** This study evaluates the effectiveness of AI-enhanced "One Body
Two Wings" pharmacovigilance models in China, focusing on improving
medication safety and risk management. As the pharmaceutical landscape
grows more complex, integrating AI into pharmacovigilance offers the
potential to enhance adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection and monitoring.
**Methods:** A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted from June 25 to
August 10, 2024, involving 1,000 participants from pharmacovigilance centers,
hospitals, corporations, and the general public. Participants were recruited
through stratified convenience sampling to ensure a broad geographical and
professional representation. Data were collected through a validated
questionnaire and analyzed using ANOVA, regression analysis, decision tree
models, and random forest algorithms. To ensure the validity of the predictive
models, resampling (SMOTE) and class weighting techniques were employed
to address significant class imbalance in the outcome variable.
**Results:** The survey revealed that 43% of participants were hospital staff and 46%
had more than 10 years of experience, with these expert groups expressing strong
support for AI's role. Path analysis indicated that AI's effectiveness in processing
ADR reports was strongly related to enhanced monitoring capabilities
(standardized path coefficient: 0.85). Furthermore, logistic regression identified
the perceived effectiveness of information systems as a significant predictor of
positive attitudes toward the model (odds ratio: 1.703). Crucially, a random
forest model, adjusted for class imbalance, confirmed that information systems
effectiveness was the most significant predictor of the model's success (mean
importance: 0.53 ± 0.05), achieving robust performance with a weighted
F1-score of 0.94 and an AUC-ROC of 0.89.

**Conclusion:** The findings confirm AI's potential to enhance pharmacovigilance,
especially in ADR monitoring. However, the study concludes that successful AI
integration is predicated on a robust information systems infrastructure, which
the data identified as the most critical foundational element. Therefore,
optimizing pharmacovigilance in China requires prioritized investment in both
this foundational IT and supportive organizational frameworks.

## 1 Introduction

Pharmacovigilance, the science and activities relating to the
detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse
effects or any other drug-related problems, is a cornerstone of
drug safety (1). As the pharmaceutical industry continues to
innovate with new drugs, the associated risks also grow,
necessitating robust pharmacovigilance systems. In response,
China has implemented several strategic initiatives to enhance its
pharmacovigilance capabilities. The introduction of the Marketing
Authorization Holder (MAH) system in 2015 was a significant
step towards aligning China's drug regulation with international
standards (2). This system places the responsibility for drug safety
squarely on the MAH, which includes pharmaceutical companies
and research institutions that have obtained drug registration
certificates (3). In 2020, the National Medical Products
Administration (NMPA) introduced the "One Body, Two Wings"
model to further strengthen China's pharmacovigilance
framework. This model positions pharmacovigilance institutions
as the central body, with marketing authorization holders and
healthcare institutions serving as the supporting wings. This
structure aims to enhance the monitoring and evaluation of
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) across the nation, ensuring a
systematic and collaborative approach to drug safety (4).

The importance of pharmacovigilance has been further
underscored by global trends, where the rapid introduction of
new drugs can outpace the capacity of existing monitoring
systems (5). For example, studies in Africa have highlighted
resource limitations as a major challenge, requiring innovative
solutions to ensure drug safety (6). In parallel, global
pharmacovigilance strategies increasingly emphasize the role of
data-driven approaches, from Europe's use of statistical
modeling for risk assessment to the international consensus on
the potential of AI to enhance safety reporting (7).

In China, this has led to a national push to integrate
pharmacovigilance practices more deeply into the healthcare

system. However, despite these efforts, significant challenges
remain. These include inadequate monitoring mechanisms,
insufficient communication between stakeholders, and delays in
responding to medication risks. These issues are particularly
pronounced at the regional level, where the implementation of
pharmacovigilance systems can be inconsistent (8). Recent
studies provide a snapshot of the current state of
pharmacovigilance in China, revealing both progress and
persistent challenges. For example, a survey of MAHs in
Guangzhou showed that while basic pharmacovigilance systems
have been established, there are still major deficiencies in
organizational structures, ADR reporting capabilities, and risk
management processes (9). Similarly, research in Hainan
indicates that a significant proportion of MAHs lack dedicated
pharmacovigilance departments and full-time staff, which are
critical for effective monitoring and management of drug safety
issues (10).

The global trend towards the integration of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) in pharmacovigilance has also begun to
influence practices in China. AI technologies offer the potential
to enhance the detection and reporting of ADRs by analyzing
vast datasets from electronic health records, social media, and
other sources (11). These tools can identify safety signals faster
and more accurately than traditional methods. However, the
implementation of AI in pharmacovigilance is still nascent, with
challenges such as data quality, regulatory hurdles, and the need
for specialized personnel slowing down adoption (12).
Moreover, a lack of comprehensive studies evaluating the
effectiveness of AI-driven pharmacovigilance systems on a
national scale persists (13).

Despite advancements in pharmacovigilance practices and the
integration of AI, significant research gaps remain. Most existing
studies are region-specific or focus on individual institutions,
leaving a gap in understanding the effectiveness of these systems
across different regions of China (14). Additionally, while AI
shows promise in enhancing pharmacovigilance, its integration
into the existing "One Body, Two Wings" pharmacovigilance
model has not been thoroughly explored. The potential for AI
to improve the speed and accuracy of ADR reporting and
thereby enhance medication safety and risk management
remains an under-researched area (15).

This study aims to bridge the knowledge gap by
comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness of AI-enhanced
"One Body, Two Wings" pharmacovigilance models across

China. We seek to understand the current issues in
pharmacovigilance management, assess the levels of familiarity
and perceived effectiveness of the "One Body, Two Wings"
model, and explore how AI can enhance these processes. Our
goal is to provide insights that will help tailor
pharmacovigilance strategies to the needs of various
stakeholders, including pharmacovigilance center managers,
hospital staff, corporate employees, and the general public. By
examining the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to
these models, this research will contribute to the evidence base
needed to refine pharmacovigilance policies and interventions,
ensuring they are not only well-conceived but also effectively
implemented across the healthcare system.

## 2 Methods

### 2.1 Study design and setting

This cross-sectional study, conducted across China from June
25 to August 10, 2024, evaluated the effectiveness of AI-enhanced
"One Body, Two Wings" pharmacovigilance models and explored
medication safety and risk management practices. The study
utilized a quantitative research design and employed the
"Questionnaire Star platform", a widely-used online tool in
China, for data collection. This approach aimed to capture the
perceptions and practices of stakeholders, including
pharmacovigilance center managers, hospital staff, corporate
employees, and the general public, regarding the
pharmacovigilance framework and AI's role in enhancing it. The
study began with a pilot phase involving 50 questionnaires
collected via convenience sampling to refine the survey design.
The main survey phase then gathered a diverse set of responses,
providing valuable insights into pharmacovigilance management,
familiarity with the "One Body, Two Wings" model, and the
perceived effectiveness of AI across different regions of China.
These findings contribute to understanding and improving the
national pharmacovigilance system.

### 2.2 Participants and data collection

This quantitative cross-sectional study targeted a diverse range
of stakeholders across China, including pharmacovigilance center
managers, hospital staff, corporate employees, and the public, all
aged 18 and older. The inclusion criteria were specifically
defined to capture perspectives from key professional groups
involved in pharmacovigilance, and the recruitment process was
an active selection strategy. Participants were selected from
various regions to ensure a representative sample reflecting
different perspectives on the "One Body, Two Wings"
pharmacovigilance model and AI's role in enhancing these
processes. Recruitment was conducted using a stratified
convenience and snowball sampling approach. Initial survey
links were distributed to a network of key contacts in different
professional groups and diverse geographical regions (e.g.,

Shanghai, Yunnan, Hebei, Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi)
who were then encouraged to share the survey within their
respective networks. This method facilitated a broad reach
across different provinces. The survey began with informed
consent, ensuring participants were fully aware of the study's
objectives. Distributed via the "Questionnaire Star platform", the
questionnaire included Likert scale and multiple-choice
questions to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding
pharmacovigilance, the "One Body, Two Wings" model, and AI
integration. While this online convenience sampling method
may be subject to selection bias (e.g., favoring more
technologically proficient participants), it was deemed the most
effective approach for achieving a broad, nationwide geographic
and multi-stakeholder reach for this exploratory study. The
focus of the analysis is on the relationships between variables
rather than estimating precise population prevalence. The
questionnaire, specifically developed for this study, was reviewed
and validated by experts in pharmacovigilance and survey
design. To further ensure reliability, a pilot study was conducted
on 50 participants, and the questionnaire's internal consistency
was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, which yielded a coefficient
of 0.82, indicating good reliability. The sample size was
calculated using the formula: z²xp × (1-p)/d², where "z" is the
z-score for a 95% confidence level (1.96), "p" is the estimated
proportion of an attribute in the population (set at 0.5), and "d"
is the margin of error (0.04). This resulted in an initial sample
size of 601. To ensure data integrity, criteria for valid responses
included unique submissions (verified by IP addresses), a
minimum completion time of 7 min, and correct answers to two
logical consistency questions. Out of 1,067 responses, 1,000 valid
responses were retained after excluding invalid entries. This final
sample size ensured statistical significance, providing a robust
dataset for analyzing the effectiveness and perceptions of the AI-
enhanced "One Body, Two Wings" pharmacovigilance model
across China.

### 2.3 Data analysis

Data preprocessing and analysis were performed using IBM
SPSS Statistics (version 22.0) and Python (version 3.10).
Descriptive statistics summarized participant demographics.
ANOVA and regression analysis identified significant patterns
and predictive relationships. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
uncovered underlying factor structures, and path analysis
modeled causal relationships. Advanced data mining techniques,
such as decision tree and random forest algorithms, were used
to predict key factors influencing the perceived effectiveness of
the management model. To address significant class imbalance
in the outcome variable, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE) and class weighting adjustments were
respectively applied to the training data for the tree-based
models. Performance was evaluated using balanced metrics,
including the weighted F1-score and AUC-ROC. All statistical
analyses used a two-tailed test with a p-value < 0.05 considered
statistically significant.

78% of the respondents. The survey's nationwide scope is evident
from its broad geographical representation, with participants from
all regions of China, including the east (Shanghai), west
(Yunnan), north (Hebei), south (Guangdong), and central regions
(Hunan and Jiangxi). This diverse geographical coverage
reinforces the national relevance of the survey results,
underscoring the engagement of a well-experienced professional
group in pharmacovigilance activities.

### 3.2 Analysis of AI capabilities in pharmacovigilance across different roles

This study examines the perceptions of AI's role in enhancing
pharmacovigilance across various professional groups, including
corporate employees, hospital staff, pharmacovigilance center
managers, and the general public. As shown in Figure 1, there are
notable differences in agreement levels regarding AI's effectiveness
in monitoring and warning systems. A significant proportion of
pharmacovigilance center managers (around 40%) strongly agree
that AI can enhance these systems, with most holding positive
views. Corporate employees also show strong support, with 147 out
of 372 agreeing with AI's potential. However, responses from
hospital staff are more mixed, with 126 out of 428 agreeing, but a
considerable number expressing skepticism. The general public's
opinions are divided as well, with 42 out of 127 agreeing and 11
disagreeing, reflecting varied familiarity with AI technologies.
Table 2 provides a detailed cross-tabulation of these responses,
highlighting the diversity in perceptions across different roles.

### 3.3 Group differences in AI attitudes in pharmacovigilance: an ANOVA analysis

A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to
examine whether there are significant differences in attitudes
towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) in pharmacovigilance among
different professional groups, including Corporate Employees,
Hospital Staff, Pharmacovigilance Center Managers, and the
General Public. The AI attitude was measured on a Likert scale
from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Table 3
revealed a statistically significant difference in AI attitudes across
these groups, with an F-statistic of 2.891 and a p-value of 0.034.
This indicates that at least one group's mean attitude towards AI
differs significantly from the others. While the analysis confirms
that role-based differences exist, it does not specify which
groups differ from each other; further post-hoc testing would be
necessary to pinpoint these differences.

### 3.4 Correlation analysis of pharmacovigilance management issues and monitoring system evaluation

management and the perceived effectiveness of the monitoring
system. The analysis highlights that inadequate monitoring and
warning mechanisms are moderately positively correlated with
unsatisfactory follow-up measures (r = 0.44), suggesting that
deficiencies in one area often coincide with issues in the other.
This indicates that improving monitoring mechanisms could
potentially enhance the follow-up procedures. Additionally,
there is a smaller positive correlation between poor
communication and inadequate monitoring mechanisms
(r=0.14), implying that communication challenges may
exacerbate monitoring inadequacies, which underscores the need
for better communication strategies to support monitoring
efforts. Interestingly, the belief in the monitoring system's
capability to detect potential medication risks shows a slight
negative correlation with identified issues such as poor

communication (r = -0.07), inadequate monitoring (r = -0.12),
and incomplete policies (r = -0.10). This suggests that
individuals who perceive significant issues in these areas tend to
have lower confidence in the monitoring system's effectiveness.
Figure 2 illustrates these correlations with a clear distinction
between positive and negative relationships.

considered key variables including the respondent's role
(categorized as Corporate Employee, Hospital Staff,
Pharmacovigilance Center Manager, and Public) and years of
work experience (grouped into 1-3 years, 4-7 years, 8-10
years, and more than 10 years). The dependent variable was
the AI attitude score, measured on a Likert scale from 1
(Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Figure 3 revealed
that Hospital Staff were significantly more likely to have a
positive attitude towards AI in pharmacovigilance compared
to the reference group, Corporate Employees, with a
coefficient of 0.164 (p = 0.023). Additionally, respondents with
more than 10 years of work experience showed a significant
positive attitude towards AI, with a coefficient of 0.177
(p=0.039), suggesting that greater professional experience
correlates with a more favorable view of AI's effectiveness.
The overall model was statistically significant (F-
statistic = 2.421, p = 0.0250), though it explained only a small
portion of the variance in attitudes (R-squared = 0.014),
indicating that other unmeasured factors likely play a role.

### 3.6 Influence of AI-related beliefs on perceived effectiveness of pharmacovigilance models: a logistic regression analysis

A logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the
association between specific beliefs regarding technology and the
perceived effectiveness of the pharmacovigilance management
model. The results are detailed in Table 4. The analysis
identified the belief in the effectiveness of information systems
as a statistically significant predictor; a higher rating on this
factor increased the odds of a respondent perceiving the overall
model as effective [OR = 1.703, 95% CI (1.482, 1.956), p < 0.001].
In contrast, neither the belief in AI's ability to enhance
monitoring [OR = 1.023, 95% CI (0.920, 1.138), p = 0.670] nor
its role in faster adverse drug reaction (ADR) processing
[OR = 1.011, 95% CI (0.903, 1.131), p = 0.850] showed a
statistically significant association with the outcome. These
findings suggest that a robust information system is the primary

factor associated with a positive perception of the management
model's effectiveness (Figure 4).

### 3.7 Interpretation of factor loadings in pharmacovigilance management

The factor loadings analysis reveals three key components of
effective pharmacovigilance management (Figure 5). The first
factor is closely linked to organizational structure and process
efficiency, with strong loadings on the importance of a city-level
organizational structure (loading = 0.75) and streamlined process
management (loading = 0.80). These findings highlight the value
placed on efficient organizational frameworks. The second factor
emphasizes technological integration, particularly artificial
intelligence (AI), with notable loadings on AI's capability to
enhance monitoring (loading = 0.80) and expedite adverse drug
reaction (ADR) report processing (loading = 0.83). This
underscores AI's transformative potential in pharmacovigilance.
The third factor highlights the essential role of information
systems in coordinated management, with a high loading on the
belief that these systems significantly improve effectiveness
(loading = 0.89). Overall, these results underscore the
importance of both organizational and technological

advancements, especially the integration of AI and information
systems, in optimizing pharmacovigilance management.

### 3.8 Exploratory factor analysis of AI and information systems in pharmacovigilance

This study conducted an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to
examine the underlying factor structure of survey items related to
the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and information
systems in pharmacovigilance. The analysis identified a single
factor that captured the common variance among three key
items. Specifically, the loading for the item "AI Enhances
Monitoring" was -0.916, while "AI Processes ADR Quickly"
had a loading of -0.930, and "Info Systems Enhance
Effectiveness" showed a loading of -0.678. These results suggest
that respondents strongly associate AI capabilities with the
overall effectiveness of pharmacovigilance practices, with
information systems also contributing significantly to this
perception. The high factor loadings indicate that these items
collectively measure a common underlying construct, likely
representing confidence in the use of AI and information
systems to improve pharmacovigilance. Figure 6 is a simplified
visualization of the EFA results. For clarity, it presents the

### 3.9 Impact of AI on pharmacovigilance: path analysis of monitoring, ADR processing, and information systems

The path analysis model (Figure 7 and Table 5) reveals the
intricate relationships between key variables in AI-enhanced
pharmacovigilance. It confirms that AI's effectiveness in
processing adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports (AI_P)
significantly influences both the perceived enhancement of
monitoring and warning capabilities (AI_E) and the overall
effectiveness of information systems (I_S). The standardized
path coefficient from AI_P to AI_E is 0.85, indicating a strong
positive relationship, while the path from AI_P to I_S has a
coefficient of 0.63, suggesting that effective AI in ADR
processing directly contributes to perceived information system
effectiveness. The model explains 27% of the variance in AI's
processing capabilities and 60% of the variance in information
system effectiveness, highlighting its robustness. These findings
emphasize AI's pivotal role in enhancing pharmacovigilance, not
only by improving specific tasks like ADR processing but also
by strengthening the broader information systems framework.
The significant path coefficients and high explained variance
validate the model, offering strong evidence that integrating AI
into pharmacovigilance enhances safety management systems.

identified the minority "Ineffective" class with a Recall of 0.65.
Analysis of the pruned tree (maximum depth = 5) revealed that
"Info Systems Effective" was the primary splitting feature,
indicating its central role in predicting management effectiveness,
with key classification rules detailed in Table 7.

### 3.11 Feature importance analysis of random forest model in predicting pharmacovigilance management effectiveness

The random forest model was used to predict the effectiveness
of the integrated One Body, Two Wings pharmacovigilance
management model. To account for significant class imbalance,
a class weighting strategy was implemented during model
training. The resulting model produced reliable performance
metrics, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.2%, a weighted
F1-score of 0.94, and an AUC-ROC of 0.89 (Table 8). This
balanced approach enabled the model to successfully classify the
"Not Effective" category (Recall = 0.68). Feature importance
analysis, stabilized via 10-fold cross-validation and calculated
using the mean decrease in Gini impurity, revealed that the
perceived effectiveness of information systems was the most
influential factor (mean importance: 0.53 ± 0.05), followed by
AI's role in enhancing monitoring (mean importance:

0.25 ± 0.03) and accelerating adverse drug reaction (ADR)
processing (mean importance: 0.22 ± 0.03). These robust
findings emphasize the critical role of information systems in
shaping perceptions of the model's effectiveness.

## 4 Discussion

### 4.1 Demographic and professional influences on AI perceptions

The study shows that demographic characteristics and
professional backgrounds significantly influence perceptions of
AI-enhanced pharmacovigilance models in China. Most
respondents were hospital staff and corporate employees, with a
strong representation of younger professionals, particularly those
aged 26-35. This skew toward younger participants likely
reflects a generational comfort with technology, contributing to
generally positive attitudes toward AI integration (16). The
significant participation of females (78%) suggests gender-
specific insights, though this imbalance may limit the
generalizability of the findings. Additionally, professional
experience plays a crucial role, with those having over 10 years
of experience more likely to view AI positively, recognizing its
potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of
pharmacovigilance, likely due to their familiarity with traditional
methods' limitations (17). This is consistent with the findings of
Ndagije et al., who identified that healthcare professionals with a
better understanding of the limitations of existing systems are
more receptive to new technological solutions like AI (18).

### 4.2 Professional role-based perceptions of AI capabilities in pharmacovigilance

The role of AI in pharmacovigilance primarily lies in its ability
to enhance monitoring and expedite adverse drug reaction (ADR)
processing. Pharmacovigilance center managers showed the
strongest support for AI, recognizing its potential to improve
efficiency and accuracy in detecting ADRs. In contrast, the varied
responses from hospital staff, including notable skepticism, may
stem from practical concerns about AI disrupting established
clinical workflows, increasing the burden of data entry, or a lack
of trust in "black box" algorithms for critical safety assessments
(19). This skepticism among hospital staff may be a result of
practical challenges in workflow integration and data reliability,
which aligns with existing literature on healthcare technology
adoption. Corporate employees generally supported AI, reflecting
their focus on operational efficiency, while the general public's
opinions were more mixed, indicating a need for broader public
education on AI's role in healthcare. Overall, while AI
demonstrates significant potential, its successful implementation
depends on addressing the specific concerns and gaining the
acceptance of all stakeholders (20).

### 4.3 Linking pharmacovigilance management challenges with monitoring systems effectiveness

The correlation analysis highlighted the significant link
between challenges in pharmacovigilance management, such as
inadequate monitoring mechanisms and poor communication,
indicating that deficiencies in one area often exacerbate issues in
another, reducing overall system effectiveness (21). This
interconnectedness underscores the need for a holistic approach
to system improvement, where enhancing communication
channels and refining monitoring protocols are addressed
simultaneously. Additionally, the analysis revealed a slight
negative correlation between confidence in the system's
capability and the presence of these issues, suggesting that
stakeholders who perceive gaps in communication and
monitoring are less confident in the system's ability to manage
drug safety effectively (22). Addressing these core deficiencies is
crucial not only for improving the technical aspects of
pharmacovigilance but also for restoring and boosting
stakeholder confidence. Prioritizing improvements in these areas
could lead to more sustainable enhancements in the
pharmacovigilance framework, fostering a more robust and
reliable system for managing medication safety (23).

### 4.4 Key factors shaping attitudes towards AI in pharmacovigilance

Regression analysis revealed that professional role and
experience are key determinants of attitudes toward AI in
pharmacovigilance. Hospital staff and individuals with over 10

years of experience showed a more favorable view of AI's
potential, likely due to their familiarity with the limitations of
traditional methods and exposure to technological advancements
(24). However, the analysis also suggested that other
unmeasured factors, such as individual exposure to AI
technologies, hands-on experience with AI tools, organizational
culture, and the perceived ease of AI integration, could
significantly influence perceptions (25). The complexity of these
influences highlights the need for further research to identify
these additional variables. Understanding how these factors
interact with professional roles and experience levels could
provide deeper insights into the barriers and facilitators of AI
adoption in pharmacovigilance, guiding the design of targeted
interventions to improve AI acceptance and integration across
various professional groups within the healthcare system (26).

### 4.5 The impact of AI and information systems on the effectiveness of pharmacovigilance

Logistic regression and path analysis highlighted the significant
impact of both AI and information systems on the effectiveness of
pharmacovigilance management. AI's ability to rapidly process
adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports was seen as valuable for
efficient monitoring, but the perceived effectiveness of
information systems played an even more crucial role in
evaluating the overall pharmacovigilance model (27). This
suggests that while AI enhances specific tasks, robust information
systems are essential for integrating AI-driven insights into an
effective management strategy (28). This finding corroborates
research by Liang et al. (29) who emphasize that AI tools must be
built upon a robust and structured data foundation provided by
effective information systems (29). These findings underscore the
need for a balanced approach that combines AI's capabilities with
strong, well-integrated information systems (30). Such systems are
vital for seamless data flow, improved information accessibility,
and coordinated responses to drug safety issues. By optimizing
the synergy between AI and information systems,
pharmacovigilance processes can be significantly enhanced,
leading to more reliable and effective medication safety
management on a national scale (31).

### 4.6 How AI and information systems empower the "One Body, Two Wings" framework

This research provides a clear model for how technology can
empower the "One Body, Two Wings" framework. AI's capacity
for rapid ADR processing and enhanced monitoring directly
strengthens the capabilities of the pharmacovigilance
institutions, which form the "Body" of the system (32).
However, our analysis decisively shows that the "Wings"-
healthcare institutions and marketing authorization holders-
can only function effectively in concert with the body if

supported by robust information systems (33). These systems act
as the essential connective tissue, ensuring that data flows
seamlessly and that AI-driven insights are translated into
coordinated action across the entire framework. Therefore, the
success of the model is not merely dependent on the intelligence
of the "Body" but on the strength and reliability of the
technological infrastructure that binds it to its "Wings" (34).

### 4.7 Insights from factor analysis on pharmacovigilance management perceptions

The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) provided statistical
validation for three underlying dimensions of pharmacovigilance
management perceptions, reinforcing the key themes discussed
previously. The first factor highlighted the importance of
organizational structure and process efficiency, with strong
loadings on city-level frameworks and streamlined management
processes, reflecting the value placed on a well-managed
pharmacovigilance infrastructure (35). The second factor
emphasized technology integration, particularly AI, showing
high loadings for its role in enhancing monitoring and
expediting adverse drug reaction (ADR) processing, aligning
with the broader trend of using AI to improve accuracy,
efficiency, and responsiveness in drug safety (36). The third
factor underscored the critical role of information systems in
coordinated management, with strong loadings indicating their
importance in data management, communication, and decision-
making. These findings suggest that the success of
pharmacovigilance initiatives relies heavily on robust
information systems that support AI applications and overall
system operations (37).

### 4.8 Implications of decision tree and random forest analyses

The machine learning analyses provide data-driven support
for the importance of technological infrastructure in
pharmacovigilance. After addressing the inherent class
imbalance in survey responses through robust methods (SMOTE
and class weighting), both the decision tree and random forest
models demonstrated that system effectiveness is a primary
predictor of positive outcomes (38). The feature importance
analysis from the random forest model is particularly revealing;
the high and stable importance score for "Information Systems
Effectiveness" (0.53±0.05) suggests that stakeholders perceive a
functional IT backbone as the most critical component for the
success of the "One Body, Two Wings" framework (39). While
AI capabilities in monitoring and ADR processing are
significant contributors, their value appears to be maximized
when they are integrated into an already effective information
system. This implies that policy and investment should prioritize
foundational IT infrastructure before or alongside the
implementation of advanced AI tools. The models' improved,

albeit imperfect, ability to predict "ineffective" cases suggests
that while technology is a key factor, organizational or human
factors not captured in the current feature set may also play a
role in instances of system failure (40).

### 4.9 Recommendations for practice and policy

To translate these findings into practice, a two-pronged
approach is essential. Firstly, "targeted education" must be
tailored to stakeholder needs: this includes hands-on workshops
for hospital staff focusing on AI's integration into clinical
workflows and data security, alongside public-facing campaigns
to build trust and awareness of AI's role in medication safety
(41). Secondly, 'sustained investment' should be directed
towards critical infrastructure: primarily, developing
standardized Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to
ensure seamless data exchange between hospital EHR systems
and national pharmacovigilance databases, and establishing a
national-level AI platform for advanced signal detection that
integrates multi-source data (42). These concrete steps are vital
for translating the potential of AI into tangible improvements in
the national pharmacovigilance system (43).

### 4.10 Limitations and future research directions

This study identified several areas where further research is
needed. The demographic skew towards younger, female
respondents, with females comprising 78% of the sample,
suggests a potential limitation in the generalizability of the
findings. This imbalance may reflect the gender distribution in
certain professional roles within healthcare, but it is a key
consideration for interpreting the results. Additionally, the
influence of unmeasured factors on AI perceptions indicates that
there is room for further exploration into what drives these
attitudes. Longitudinal studies could provide insights into how
perceptions of AI and information systems in pharmacovigilance
evolve over time, particularly as these technologies become more
integrated into daily practices.

## 5 Conclusion

This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of AI-
enhanced "One Body, Two Wings” pharmacovigilance models in
China, highlighting the crucial and synergistic roles of artificial
intelligence (AI) and robust information systems. The findings
show that while AI improves the efficiency and accuracy of
adverse drug reaction (ADR) monitoring, its success relies on a
foundational, well-structured information system. The perceived
effectiveness of these systems was a stronger and more stable
predictor of positive attitudes than AI factors alone,
underscoring AI's role as a powerful complement rather than a

standalone solution. The study also found that professional roles
and experience significantly influence AI acceptance, with
insights relevant to global pharmacovigilance strategies. The
research concludes that sustained investment in technological
infrastructure, particularly in strengthening core information
systems, is the key prerequisite for effectively leveraging AI to
enhance medication safety management in China and beyond.
