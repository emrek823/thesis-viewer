Hiring

Community

Control the chaos. Deeply understand the gamer / neurodivergent spectrum. Most engaged members can spiral

Moderation is non-trivial but known

Clinician hiring is bottle neck. Places to help with therapist recruiting. Other paths that don’t rely on therapist recruiting.

Market saturated so hiring is difficult?

Temporary blip?

Community

Experiments lined up on the community

More mental health advocates to moderate (rather than members)

Level up to have some clout within the community

Up to 10K in the discord

Opposite of typical game (pent up demand)

De-risk that

Community as group or entire discord

Subclinical vs. clinical

HJC Overview

What got me excited

Amount of time people were spending in the discord and the genuine interaction. Potential for global impact

How do you measure the health of the community and what does success look like for you on the community side over the next 12 months (total #, activity types, types of users, etc)?

Discord vs. journeyers

Cost (can’t even afford co-pay)

Journeyers paying by session

Safe space and closed wall in discord for $20-$30 / month

Community is difficult to scale

Tiered membership for journeyers to run sessions

How do you make sure members don’t fall in love with journey guides

Conversion from discord to community but also the other way (re-attribution and LTV)

Journeyers have another space to go

People leave for any reason

Screen out for folks in crisis

Pull them aside and do de-escalation and refer out

Very attractive for enterprises as well

Really scalable triage and referral patterns

Near term is to partner with groups that can take in new members

Subclinical with therapist

Showed the best signs of overall improvement

Beyond that

The discussion around the shrinking on the enterprise side on mental health a little bit

Shrinking on consumer and enterprise side

Skepticism of 1:1 teletherapy - folks are rejiggering the reimbursement amount and criteria

More risky b/c it’s competitive

Self-pay

Get answer for 6-9 months

Community roadmap

Community member

Teens likely get their own subsection that is ID verified

More education for onboarding - what to share / what not to shar e

How do we set expectations

More granules

Experiments we are running with the community

Subclinical vs. clinical

What’s prompting it now? Growing concern internally about what is therapy and what isn’t

Can we bring someone on to do licensing hours with us?

Insurance coverage for 1:1 therapy or IOP carve outs

PC network - 8 week to 6 months and impliations for product and where we can practicee

What do users want?

Want sessions to have psychoeducation

It’s purely subclinical

Claims of efficacy rather than the tools themselves

Speed and differentiation

Subclinical is much more effective here before people with licesnsed clinicians come in

Mental health

Iterated 9 companies and continue to crank out experiments

6-9 months will look so radically different from what’s out ther today

Continuing to go subclinical

Training and onboarding very focused on subclinical

Report and text / audio considerations

Squat thing that you do in minecraft

Legal

No PC network

Hiring therapists to provide coaching (not licensed)
