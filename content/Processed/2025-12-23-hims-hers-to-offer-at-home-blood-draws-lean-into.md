[Hims & Hers Health](/quotes/HIMS/) announced Wednesday it has acquired New Jersey-based at-home lab testing facility Trybe Labs.

The deal will allow the telehealth company [to offer at-home blood draws](https://www.hims.com/comprehensive-lab-testing) and more comprehensive pretreatment testing to its users.

"Access to richer data allows us to deepen the insights that providers can use on our platform to guide their clinical decisions for each individual patient," said Dr. Patrick Carroll, Hims & Hers chief medical officer.

"At-home lab testing is one more exciting step towards elevating the personal, comprehensive care customers in this country should expect," Dr. Carroll added.

Hims & Hers did not disclose terms of the deal, but said it funded it through cash on hand. The company told CNBC it will share pricing for the new testing options when the offering is made available to customers over the next year.

The acquisition by Hims & Hers will offer competition to blood-drawing services such as Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics.

The startup is expanding its services less than one year after it started offering [compounded GLP-1](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/20/hims-hers-compounded-glp-1-injections.html) weight loss drugs. As Hims & Hers casts itself as a cheaper alternative to established companies, it recently took aim at the pharmaceutical industry in a [Super Bowl ad](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/10/hims-hers-super-bowl-ad-sparks-controversy.html), saying the industry is "priced for profits, not patients."

"The health care that customers expect and deserve today is on-demand care with treatments designed specifically for them," said Dr. Carroll.

On Friday, the company separately announced it has acquired a U.S.-based peptide facility in California as part of its latest expansion of that domestic supply chain.

"A lot of peptide demand is future facing innovation," Andrew Dudum, Hims & Hers Health CEO told CNBC Friday following that announcement. "So many use cases have yet to be launched," he added.

The acquisition follows previous purchases of drug manufacturing facilities in Ohio and Arizona over the last six years.

While Hims did not disclosure the international exposure of its supply chain, Dudum did emphasize this deal comes at a time when the Trump administration is cracking down on the broader pharmaceutical industry's reliance on overseas production.

Peptide therapy has gained popularity in recent years, particularly within the fitness and wellness community. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vocalized support for the treatment as alternative medicine, saying it has been under "aggressive suppression" by the Food and Drug Administration like other alternatives like psychedelics, stem cells and raw milk.

However, the excitement surrounding peptide innovations have limited scientific evidence supporting their long-term benefits.

Dudum said the acquisition will allow his company to explore areas including recovery science, preventative health and rejuvenation.

"Peptide innovation is at the forefront of so many categories we're excited to start offering," said Dudum.

## Trybe acquisition

Hims & Hers' acquisition of Trybe Labs will add testing capabilities for LDL cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), cholesterol and apolipoprotein, the company said. It will also expand the company's ability to offer access to care and treatments across a range of conditions including low testosterone and perimenopausal and menopausal support.

Hims & Hers users will be given a [blood lancet](https://www.tassoinc.com/tasso-plus) provided by home diagnostic testing company [Tasso](https://www.tassoinc.com/). The lancet is a single-use device that collects whole liquid blood samples and is cleared for premarket use by the FDA.

Users attach the device to their upper arm and press a button that triggers the lancet to prick the skin and draw a small amount of blood collected in a microtube.

Providers on the platform will use the information collected as part of determining a treatment plan for patients.

Hims & Hers said it will use data from the blood work — with patient identities removed — to accelerate its development of artificial intelligence-powered health care.

*Clarification: This story was updated to reflect that the new testing services will aid the company's perimenopausal care.*
