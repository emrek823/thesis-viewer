### Company Updates and High-Level Vision

- 5 contrarian views driving the company
	- Neutrality is the moat - stronger conviction than expected
	- Fragmentation is opportunity, not barrier
	- Scale through intermediaries, not end customers (new realization)
	- Network effects matter more than proprietary tech
	- Identified data bigger market than de-identified data
- Most important: neutrality as superpower for counter-positioning against ChartSwap
- Partner mapping exercise with advisor David Dorans completed
	- Clear prioritization order established
	- Market size adjustments: Insurance now 15M requests/year (was 5M)

	- Salesforce integration underway

### Fundraising Strategy and Vision Refinement

- Fundraising timeline: January launch
- Three proof points for investors
	- Platform built ✓
	- Requesters attracted (on track by year-end)
	- Partners attracted ✓
- Need stronger “so what” narrative for bigger vision
	- Focus on identified vs de-identified data opportunity
	- Extrapolate 3-5 year market position potential
	- Frame around AI/ChatGPT data access challenges
- Health conference in Vegas upcoming - good timing for narrative refinement
