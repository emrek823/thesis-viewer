**Q:** Can you speak to the product's value proposition, positioning relative to competitors, pricing, and the product evaluation process / criteria? Please elaborate.
**A:** Yes.

**Tegus Client**
So we're doing some research into this space and wanted to get your view as a user of RillaVoice and understand naturally your background and how you use the product today.

And so before we dive into specific questions on the company and the product, I think it would be helpful for us just to get a sense of your background and your overview of your business and why you started looking for a solution like Rilla to use at your company?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Well, I can start there. My background is in sales. I started doing outside sales knocking on doors during my summers in college in 2005. So I spent nine years with a company called Southwestern Advantage. They're the oldest door-to-door company in the United States. I worked anywhere from three to four months per year knocking on doors 80 hours a week and managing teams of five to 40 doing the same thing. Did that for nine years, then transitioned to home security and home automation.

And with my brother, and now business partner, he and I worked in that industry for seven years. Same thing, this was my time was a little bit longer. It was closer to five to six months a year of full-time knocking and then leading teams -- our organization at one point was 150 people. So we were leading a pretty large organization, all primarily door knocking. And then in the fall of 2020, right amidst the pandemic, we decided to launch a solar company.

So we launched in 2020 and have had roughly 60 to 100 active sales reps the whole time. And we primarily knock on doors because I've done that my whole career, and training people to do that for almost 16 years. So that was our primary mode of business. When we started Genesis, we just thought we were going to do a setter/closer model. So we have door knockers is what we had in the beginning. We had guys knocking on doors booking appointments for our closers. And so we had two and in the spring of 2022, I was introduced to Rillavoice.

But five years before I found Rillavoice, I was like, man, if something like this existed, I would be a purchaser of it. And so when I found it in 2022, I was like, wait, wait. So this listens to my sales reps. It gives me an audio and it gives me a transcript and I can search for keywords and all of that, let's roll.

So we signed up -- I want to call it like a trial, a proof of concept. And after about 1.5 months, we realized that the app that we were using we were using SPOTIO, that's our canvassing app. Between SPOTIO and Rilla there were far too many clicks, like sales reps didn't like it because they had to click on the lead and then swipe over and then start Rilla and then swipe back and then complete the lead and swipe over and then close Rilla.

And even though that only sounds like two or three swipes, they didn't love it. So we pressed pause and the team spent two or three months getting it fully integrated with SPOTIO. I helped with that connection, and so they got that up and rolling, and now they're fully integrated to where when a rep starts the day, they can press start.

And at the end of the day, they can press stop, and then it parses all the information within a few hours afterwards, minutes, but a few hours to be safe to where every lead is tagged and then we actually have it upload the audio back into SPOTIO. So the closer can click on it and hear how the appointment was booked, so that's how we use it.

We also use it for our closers and then our management listens into it, but our goal was to get [ game film ] on every one of our reps. And if we're coaching a team in Florida, I can still jump on and give them coaching and give them real-time feedback and send it to everybody else in the organization to listen to. So, if there's

any part of that story you want more detail on, I'm happy to give it but that's -- there's my background and how we found Rilla.

**Tegus Client**
Thank you. So obviously at least based on my familiarity with Rilla, they're really focused on kind of just like the whole field service verticals. So everything from what you're doing with solar to windows, doors, HVAC, all that stuff.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
I'm assuming there's also more horizontally focused companies that do similar things out here or that do similar things to Rilla with regard to the sales process. So I'd love to hear a little bit more about like specifically, what are some of the features that really make it good for the kind of field service space and home services space versus just more of a horizontal platform like how are they really tailored?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Yes. You mean specifically like when you say horizontal platform are you talking about phone sales type things?

**Tegus Client**
Yes, it could be any type of phone sales or like a platform but has the same capabilities of Rilla where it looks at the sales rep transcript, but -- and analyze it and all that, but it's not necessarily focused on field services specifically. It could be for any type of sales, so I'm just curious like how Rilla actually tailors it for the field services space.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
I honestly -- I don't feel that it is specifically tailored for that. It's tailored for outside sales and whether that's in home services or I mean, man, you could use it if you're selling carwash subscription.

Like, you go to the car wash, the guy tries to upgrade you like every one of their reps could be using Rilla in that sense and you could use it nationwide. So I don't think it has a limitation just to door-to-door sales or home services. I think it's just -- the biggest, I think, hurdle for most companies is integration and simplicity. And so if you had a system where it was simple and easy, then I don't think it would be crazy at all.

If I ran a car wash, for example, like I'd have the carwash phone that sits there and every person who's working that hub has a little microphone on and I'd capture all of it. I'd figure out what are the best practices and who's not great. I know there's other companies that do that, but I if your question is, are they limited to inside or outside field sales, I don't think so.

**Tegus Client**
No, that's super helpful.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Or home services.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. No, that makes sense. And then I guess another question I have on Rilla as well is on their website it mentioned that they are partners with ServiceTitan. So I'm wondering if you guys use ServiceTitan at your firm? And if there's any sort of integration that you have with Rilla and kind of how they work together.

Yes, we don't. We're not using that feature, but we they are fully integrated with SPOTIO for us, which is a canvassing app.

**Tegus Client**
And we're less familiar with that company. Can you just expand on that and why that's important to your type of field sales to make sure we understand like why that was so critical for you guys?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Yes, absolutely. So any company that's doing outside sales -- I mean, when I started in 2005, I had a piece of notebook paper, and that's how I kept track of which doors I was going to knock on and where to go. But now there are a handful of apps that -- Google Maps, you've got to pin on every house and your -- it keeps track of wherever your reps are.

So it shows you where your reps are, you can move leads to different stages. You can have different visit results. So when our reps are knocking, their nose is inside of SPOTIO the entire time and they're saying, okay, that house looks like their home. They click on the little icon and the icon says, that's Employee A and Employee B. So they walk over there, they take all their notes inside of that lead. They do everything inside of that lead.

And the way their SPOTIO integration works with Rilla is at the beginning of the day before I start my day, I just press record on Rilla and then let it run in the background. And what it's doing then is it's tying all of its time stamps to the time stamps inside of the visit results in SPOTIO.

So every time one of our reps, they walk up to someone's door and they knock on the door. And then at the end of the conversation, they disposition that lead. SPOTIO's pulling or sorry, Rilla is taking that information, hey, X Person dispositioned this lead as a meaningful conversation.

That means it was a good amount of a conversation. So it's going to parse out the previous 20 minutes from when I marked it and then tag it to that house. It's going to do that for every door, every qualified decision maker. So if it's just a door where -- which is like a quick no, we don't record those ones, but anything that is a qualified decision maker, so an actual prospect, it's going to pull eight minutes of data. If it's a meaningful conversation, 20 minutes of data.

And so at the end of the night, as a manager, I can log on and I can say, "Hey, X Person had -- he met 20 prospects today, 20 qualified decision makers, and he had seven meaningful conversations." Well, let me listen to those and see why he didn't book those appointments or see what happened, what objections was he dealing with.

And so it allows you to be very what sort of, very targeted in your research into what your reps need help with. And so any door knocking asset that would have the capability of doing that. I think that's -- the biggest advantage of Rilla is if I'm knocking on doors and I have a recording software that is customized and built into my app, it's just -- then I don't even have to think about it. And that's been -- that was when it really took off for us.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. And so do your reps know that they're actually using Rilla for the recording?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Oh, yes. Yes, they have to press on and off. Yes. So.

**Tegus Client**
And that on/off button is built directly into the SPOTIO app or.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
No.

**Tegus Client**
They're doing that in the Rilla app, but then all of that data aggregation is tied together through the integration.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Correct. And I think there's definitely some kinks to work out. And our biggest like -- why isn't a rep using it? They just forgot to turn it on or they turned it on, and then they were trying to save batteries, so they killed all their apps and didn't realize that they killed it.

And when you kill it, it doesn't necessarily have a stop time. And so if it doesn't have a stop time, it just deletes the data for the whole day. So there's some kinks for sure. But what impressed me was their willingness and ability to get it 85% to 90% of the way there within a month to two months. And it's just every time I brought up a hey, here's a glitch, they've always been able to figure it out.

**Tegus Client**
And are there any other tools that are there any other tools that you integrated with besides SPOTIO that you use Rilla with?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
That we use Rilla with. Yes. I mean, we've got -- I mean, do you count Google Sheets? We have the first recording. Like we at one point, we were measuring everything. We were measuring the gaps between people's houses. We were actually using Rilla as a time stamp because it's possible that a guy gets in the field and doesn't log a visit for the first five to 10 minutes.

And so what we were counting for your work hours were when did you turn on your Rilla and when did you turn it off? And so we had -- I mean, I'm pretty sure that was custom just for us, but it's a it was a unique thing. I was like, guys, everybody has to use Rilla.

And we were paying hourly for like two months which was a big mistake. Don't pay door-to-door reps hourly. They will not work. But I was like, how do you track the hours? We tracked it with Rilla. That's what we did. We just said, "Hey, you count as working when your Rilla is on. When your Rilla is off, it doesn't count as working." And so we were quite literally paying people based off of how much Rilla recording they were doing for those two months.

**Tegus Client**
So after like, let's say, you recorded Rilla, and you want to go through the recordings or teach your sales reps. Is that whole thing manual or is there any like automated suggestions that Rilla also provides like can they do some of the coaching or is it all just you who's like going through with your sales reps manually?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
It -- as far as I know, it's all us. It does have some AI stuff, and I haven't been as active myself on it in the last two months since ChatGPT took over the world. So I mean it's possible that Rilla now has an animated gorilla that coaches people that I don't know about, but it's like it has all been manual.

And what we found, if you care about best practice, like I just log on from my computer, much easier to do it on a computer than it is to do it on a phone for a coach. For just an individual rep, the phone is great but if you're trying to coach a whole team, the computer is way better because I can log in, and I can search by a specific rep.

Just for today, by disposition and then I can just click through the 10 of those. And I had given them feedback that it would be nice to be able to click through them easier and also show you which ones were listened to and not listened to by you personally, and I know that's something that they're working on.

But our if you're asking about how we use it for coaching, you just manually look through it, you'd find the rep, and it's nice because when you click into it I can see just like on a memo on your iPhone, you can see where the talking happened, and it shows you who's talking, whether it's the customer or the rep. And so I

can fast forward very quickly find where the conversation started. I can take notes. I can tag the entire company. I can tag certain reps.

So if I know one rep is struggling with bookings like doing the -- finding a time with the customer, and I know another rep is really good at that. I go to the really good rep. I find a great example of it, and I tag Employee X. Like, hey, Employee X, listen right here. This is exactly what I'm talking about that you need help with.

If I hear a great one, I just tag the whole company. Hey, guys, everybody take a listen to this one. And right -- and it tags it at the minute that you're writing the note. So if I'm writing the note at three minutes into the thing, that's where the tag shows up, which is cool.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, that's super cool. I guess so that's a really cool feature. Are there any other like features that you use really frequently because obviously, we haven't done a demo. So any other features that you really like about Rilla that stand out?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Yes. We -- I mean, two simple ones like it's great to be able to see who's been listening to the most and how many hours of recording they've listened to. That's been really good. There was a we have one branch that is -- has been much more they've adopted Rilla more than anybody else.

And they require all of their reps between their orientation week and the week that they first start knocking full time. They require them to listen to 100 Rillas. So it was like click in and listen to 100 conversations over the course of the weekend.

And we want you to listen to the good, the bad, the ugly. Like listen to the 30 second one, listen to the 20-minute one, listen to all of them because it is a virtual sale -- bootcamp's the wrong word, but it's like a virtual sales gauntlet, like you get to experience a day in the field without having to have a day in the field, and that team has done really well.

**Tegus Client**
Are their sales better than the rest of the team? What's the ROI impact on.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
This is what's so interesting, and I'll just be like -- we've had three different phases of Rilla. Phase #1, use it if you want to use it. Phase #2, everyone is required to use it. Phase #3, whichever branches want it can have it but if you stop using it, we're going to cut it off.

And part of it has just been -- it's hard to teach old dogs new tricks. And when we started the company, we had a lot of more experienced reps. And then when we signed up with Rilla, we had some people that had been with us for a while, but the use case that is the most applicable is our younger team who have absolutely been killing it in sales with the tool.

And then there's the old guys who like, they are not using it, they're not really holding their team accountable to it, so I just shut it off. So it's like I'm not going to -- if you're not going to use it, it don't matter how cool the tool is, if you don't use it, we shouldn't pay for it, so that's been a very interesting development.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. No, that's super interesting because I mean it's great to have like this kind of A/B test where you know like you can clearly see if they've been more successful using Rilla. So I guess, going back before you decide to go with Rilla, I know you mentioned you kind of thought of the idea on your own separately. And just wondering if there are any other tools that you evaluated when you were looking for something like Rilla.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
We looked at Gong just because we had a friend that worked there, but that was almost entirely inside sales phone sales, so that -- it wasn't really applicable. We've used Voice Memos a lot. So kudos to Apple, but

hard to send those between Apple and Android and there's all those problems anyways.

Since we since using Rilla, we looked into Siro, which is probably their biggest competitor in our space. And Siro -- it's the same thing. It's just not as advanced, like I'm not trying to belittle what either company is doing, but like I did a whole demo with them and my thought the whole time is and how is this different?

And I kept asking them how is it different? And every answer was it's the same thing. It's just a little more gamified, but in what it gains in gamification, it lost in actual like added benefit. It just wasn't -- I wasn't blown away by it. It would have been a sidestep and it would have improved a few things from Rilla, but it would have been a step back as well, so it wasn't really a viable option for us.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. Can you maybe elaborate on like what was better about it and what was worse about it relative to Rilla?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Yes. I like their gamification. So just the way that their stat's read and kind of the layout and workflow -- the app, I like a little bit better. I don't know if I can give you specific like things, but the flow seemed a little bit better.

And then -- but as far as what it was tracking and how it was tracking, I think Rilla had the advantage there. So Siro was prettier, Rilla was better. Siro was Apple. Rilla is Android. Like I felt like I could customize Rilla a lot more than I could Siro, but it's -- I think Siro may be more of a cut and paste product and Rilla is more of a customized product. At least that was my two impressions.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. No, that makes a ton of sense. And then I guess, in terms of pricing as well, were they pretty comparable?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Yes. They were comparable. Yes, they're comparable. We got some grandfather pricing from being a very early adopter, but if we were buying brand new right now, they'd be the same.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And is it just a for Rilla, is it just like monthly subscription or how is it typically priced?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Yes. It's a monthly subscription, but once you get to a big enough size, then you'll pay quarterly or annually. Actually, I think even their single rep subscriptions might be annually now for a lot of them.

**Tegus Client**
That is helpful. And then any shortcomings that you've seen with Rilla or any areas where you'd like to see them improve upon?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
That's a good question. Yes, I think some of the workflow stuff in the app, I think just smoothing that out. But I think there's room for someone who has been knocking on doors for 10 to 20 years, and they probably have this person, but just room for them to get out in the field and use it or use it as a manager to go, if we could have it laid out like this, that will be a little bit better. I think there's room for that.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. That's helpful. Obviously, you mentioned you have it integrated with SPOTIO. How long did it take to roll out the product to the teams that wanted it and like get all the integration set up?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
I mean, once they had the SPOTIO integration, it was just turning it on. I mean, it was less than a week. I just met with one of their guys and I said, here's our sales script. Here's what we want tagged and they did 90% of the work and then showed me how to make edits and it's pretty simple.

**Tegus Client**
Two follow-up questions. Out of all the sales reps you have today, how many are using Rilla?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Really good question. Under 20%. So 10% to 20% are using it on a daily basis.

**Tegus Client**
Got it.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
At one point it was 100%. Yes.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And that was Phase two of your guys' experience with Rilla and now it sounds like you've reduced your contract with them because it's only 10% to 20%.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
We reduced our contract -- yes, and our contract reduction has nothing to do with the product. They had to do with the adoption. And so my like this is -- what's really -- if you want my opinion on things.

Here's what -- if I'm looking at Rilla as a software because I've had a couple of these conversations. And if I'm looking at it, the product is great. The area where we get stuck is, are people using it because it's not like a gym membership.

The goal is not to have a whole bunch of people paying for monthly subscriptions that they're not using because it's not cheap and there's supposed to be a massive return on the investment for getting it. And so if there's not a return, people are just going to shut it off.

So my thought is like you have to get it to people right away and they have to form the habit of using it because then they'll never want to be without it. And that's what happened with these guys. They just use it, use it, use it. Now they don't want to be without it.

And so that's like finding an organization that has -- I don't think the market for Rilla is a company that already has 1,000 employees. I think the market for Rilla is partnering with a company when it's tiny so that the manager can be in two places at once.

And as the manager is illustrating to his team, hey, I can be in two or three or four places at once, you can do the same thing as you grow your team. This is how we use it. And if the manager is active and if the manager is actively reporting and giving feedback, then his team is going to do the same thing as they grow up, so I think that's a really important distinction.

And then the other piece is, I think in Rilla, they could simplify what they're doing to just be recordings with measuring some of the success KPIs. And if they could do that fully partnered, fully wrapped in, fully hugged with an organization like right now, we pay SPOTIO and Rilla and the cost is X for SPOTIO and X for Rilla, but if it was yes, X for SPOTIO, X for Rilla so 2x.

But if we were paying 1.5x for SPOTIO, and it included Rilla, I think it would be our whole company would have. But you need the knocking app before you need the software. And so that's like in the hierarchy of needs in our industry, the knocking app is superior to the recording app, and you'll never have someone with the recording app without a knocking app.

So anybody like so it's like so getting them combined, like link together, combine together, shake hands, build -- I think that -- I think there's an opportunity for an investor who can grow the product, build the business and then find a partner to say, "Hey, you're going to be powered by Rilla." Or whatever it is. And doing that before that company has the decision to just make it itself, which most of them won't, but some will try.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense, and from a tech perspective to run your business, are there any other software apps that you guys use? It sounds like the main two largest are SPOTIO and Rilla but would love to understand if there's any other vendors that you guys also leverage in your business, just so we can understand how you stack rank those if there's more than those two.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
So we use SPOTIO and Rilla for door knocking. We use a lot of Zapier, you guys are familiar with them. That's how we tie all this stuff together. And we've got Zapier tied into monday.com and Google Sheets and Looker Studio and Calendly to run our entire sales force. So Calendly for scheduling SPOTIO for the CRM. Monday for the post-sale CRM. Looker Studio and Google Sheets for all of the sales stats reporting.

And one of the reasons we're we did that is because none of those solutions covered everything. And so we've got things held together in a lot of unique ways that I don't -- I think a lot of companies aren't doing. So with all that, like I could speak about monday.com, I could talk about Calendly and how they integrate and we talk about a lot of those things.

There's a new product, a company called Sunbase and Knockbase, and they are specifically a first knock to final inspection company that handles everything and will, in many ways, eliminate the need for us to have all five of the things I just mentioned.

Taking a while to build it out, but they are they have figured out how to integrate all of it into one system, and they're specific for home services. And so any home services, air commissionings, roofs, windows, siding, solar, all of that is inside of this program that can be custom built for any company.

And so we're going to move a lot of our tech stack to that. Hopefully, by Christmas, we've been working on it for like 1.5 months. So the goal is to bring that to the finish line in the next three weeks and potentially be off of our other software by the beginning of January.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. Thank you. And you guys would keep Rilla post this integration or are they also doing the off-line sales recording?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
So they don't have it. They don't have offline sales recording. I've told them they should build it. But like, I think you should build it because I think if it's integrated into your product, you can charge more for your product. And I don't think it costs as much to build as you could charge for it.

So I think you get an immediate ROI just building it in. I said, or you should partner with Rilla and integrate that. So I've already suggested what I suggested to you guys to them because I know we have people that will want recording software, like we will always -- I will never not think it's awesome. And I'll continue to pitch it to our reps and tell them how great it is. And maybe once they've knocked for 20 years, they'll figure out how great this tool is.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. That makes sense. And then I guess, just quickly going back to the Zapier comment. Are you using Zapier to integrate SPOTIO with Rilla today or is there a direct integration there?

The only -- it's a direct integration, and then -- but the -- we're using Zapier at the end of the integration, the end of the direct integration to drop the recording back into SPOTIO.

**Tegus Client**
Got it.

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
But I know that's something they want to be a direct integration, but that's the one little connection that they built on the back end for us.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And I guess with the Sunbase/Knockbase app, obviously, first of all will be nice to have everything kind of integrated, will it also be a lot cheaper just using the one app versus having all these different point solutions?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Versus having the tech stack, yes. Yes, it's not. I mean, it's actually more expensive than our current door-knocking app. But if you take the door knocking plus Calendly -- plus SPOTIO, plus Calendly, plus Monday, plus we use 500,000 Zaps a month. Just like if you take all of those things and put them in one place, it ends up being cheaper by 25% to 50% than what we're paying now, but it's actually more expensive than our current canvassing app.

**Tegus Client**
Is there anything that we haven't covered that you think we should know about the company and/or this industry just as we continue to learn more about the space?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Yes. I think there are I got this question a few months ago, but like what's the viability of outside sales, like especially in the world of AI in a world of pandemics and whatever we got going on.

A couple of case studies. We actually found COVID to be an increase in success like people who are sitting at home not talking to people, so they actually enjoy having people come to their door, which is that was surprising, but we saw a massive increase in sales during that period of time.

And then with AI and whatever -- my brother and I have been building this company for three years. The desire for people to get into door-to-door is high, and I think the viability of the industry long term is also high because I think a lot of people are desiring human contact.

Even though they don't expect it to come to their front door, there's actually a lot of people that appreciate having a conversation about products rather than just having to look everything up online. So we're still optimistic about the actual method that this helps with because if it -- because there's a lot of competitors who've been doing inside sales for a long time.

So Rilla is very specific to the outside sales in the field type selling. And I just -- I don't think that's going to go anywhere. I think it's actually going to increase because there are a lot of people that have figured out if I can go directly contact someone at their home, they know I'm real and they know at least -- they know that I'm a real person.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. That makes sense. I guess, actually, just one more question for me. As you think about like expansion opportunities for Rilla, is the most obvious one really just like going into like kind of the door-knocking space or so doing something similar to what SPOTIO is doing or is there something else that you think they should expand into first? Like how would you think about that if you're running the business?

**Co-Founder and President of Genesis Power Solutions**
Yes. Well, the riches are in the niches. So if I'm thinking, like is there going to be an AI they're already making -- Ray-Ban has this sunglasses have music come out of them and the Google Glass was a thing 10 years ago, but there's new versions of that coming out.

So I think at some point, there's an app that is listening to the conversation and telling you to speed up and slow down and you're just reading it through your glasses. Now, it depends on if someone wants to -- I think the cost of that type of software has to come down before it will get implemented in our space.

And so until then, I think a company that's willing to adapt, willing to grow. That's what I would look at is like, are you willing to adapt, let's say, two years from now, a recording software that tells you when you're talking too fast and tags it, that's just like it comes included with Apple.

It's like what happens when that -- when all of a sudden, that is -- it's easy for everybody. What are your next advancements? Where do you go into next? Are you willing to? Or is this the hill you're going to die on, is recording through a door knocking app because I mean we -- just in our business, we know that we can't be a single legged stool, like we've got to have door knocking, we've got to have referral business. We've got to have commercial, we've got to be able to do more than just solar, like we've got to diversify because otherwise, you're screwed.

And so what's the diverse -- if you're asking what's the diversification of Rilla, I'm not sure there's a diversification of the current product, but there will be a there will absolutely have to be an evolution of what the project -- product is to make sure that it stays -- I know they -- I mean, they were adding in live look-ins where you could actually live coach your reps, and I think it was through a chat function.

I don't think that's ready to go yet, but they're -- that's something that they're building because that's the way they're going. And I think between Siro and Rilla, Rilla was more the company that was like, "All right, what's the next thing that we can how can we make this better, more applicable and stay ahead of the curve." And as long as they continue to do that, I think they'll be great.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. Thanks so much for taking the time to chat - have a great rest of your day!
