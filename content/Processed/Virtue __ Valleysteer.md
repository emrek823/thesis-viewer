### Business Update & Financial Performance

- Not performing as well as desired, but better than last update
- Operations and technical progress on track
- Financially under plan, making changes for improvement
- Current performance metrics:
	- Belong Health: ~$30K MRR for August
	- Vituity: Legal review pending for 30-40K MRR (12 months), then doubling
	- Emblem: Tens of thousands MRR potential (close to signing)
	- Clover: Expanding existing relationship
- Target: 2-3M ARR by year end (did ~1M first 6 months)
- Astrana situation: Down from 70-80K to 30K MRR due to cost cutting
	- Still providing some support despite operational mess
	- Maintaining good relationships for references

### Product Evolution & Technical Infrastructure

- Shifted from broad AWV approach to deeper, specialized products
- Built structured + unstructured data processing with targeted actions
- Key differentiators: First-party reviewers, no offshore PHI access, CCD data review
- Two October launches:
	- Quality measure clinical finding engine (90% automated)
	- Real-time unit economics measurement system
- Margin analysis:
	- LLM projects: ~80% gross margin (excluding fixed costs)
	- Consulting projects: ~20% margin
	- Volume-dependent profitability due to onboarding complexity
- New system enables automated prompt management without engineering involvement

### Go-to-Market Strategy & Fundraising Plans

- Pivoting to Part D wedge strategy due to 9-12 month sales cycles
- Part D focus rationale:
	- Triple weighted measures
	- Claims-only audits (no clinical data needed)
	- Clear displacement opportunity vs. AdhereHealth
- Hiring subject matter experts as “sales engineers” for credibility
- Testing wedge with 2-3 health plans, targeting pipeline fill by year end
- Series A plans for Q1/Q2:
	- Seeking strategic investors (Multicare, Intermountain)
	- NEA/Floodgate as institutional anchors
	- Current runway: $2.8M cash, decreasing burn rate
