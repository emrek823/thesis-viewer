## Slide 2: THE GENDER HEALTH GAP PERSISTS

THE GENDER HEALTH GAP PERSISTS

Women weren't in clinical research until 1993.

Today, we are diagnosed 4 years later than men on average for 770+ diseases.

## Slide 3: MEET EVVY

MEET EVVY
We're taking the guesswork out of women's health by discovering and leveraging **new biomarkers** in the female body, starting with the vaginal microbiome.

## Slide 4: THE VAGINAL MICROBIOME

THE VAGINAL MICROBIOME
The unexplored key to female health issues.

Yet — women don't have access to this info about our own bodies, and the system doesn't use it to make better decisions.

(Visual: Overlapping bubbles representing conditions linked to the Vaginal Microbiome)
*   Bacterial Vaginosis
*   STI Acquisition
*   Yeast Infections
*   Endometriosis & PCOS
*   Pre-term Birth
*   Recurrent UTIs
*   Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
*   Cervical Cancer
*   IVF Success / Fertility

## Slide 5: Know what's up down there.

Text on box:
The female body shouldn't be a medical mystery¹
@EVVYBIO
¹Women weren't included in US clinical research until 1993. It takes us 4 years later than men to be diagnosed on average for 770+ diseases. Less than 4% of all healthcare funding goes towards women's health. We can only imagine what's possible when we give women the same quality of healthcare. (But we ran out of room on the box.)

Know what's up ↑down there.↓

The Evvy Vaginal Health Test demystifies what's up down there, why it matters to your health, and what you can do about it.

Simultaneously, we're generating the largest, longitudinal dataset on the vaginal microbiome, unlocking groundbreaking insights on how to detect and treat a variety of critical health conditions.

## Slide 6: OUR FIRST USERS

OUR FIRST USERS
Evvy provides answers for the millions of women dealing with vaginal infections.

| Condition               | Statistic                                                                                              |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **30%**                 | of women will get BV, 80% will recur within 3 months of treatment.                                     |
| **75%**                 | will get a yeast infection, 8.5% will become recurrent.                                                |
| **50%**                 | will get a UTI, 30% will become recurrent.                                                             |
| *Recurrent = getting an infection 3-4x+ per year* | (Note: This is a footnote for the statistics above)                                          |

## Slide 7: A VICIOUS CYCLE

A VICIOUS CYCLE
The journey to relief is excruciating.
Vaginal health issues interrupt joy — daily.

**DEBILITATING PHYSICAL / MENTAL TOLL**
Symptoms + anxiety

*Social Media Post 1*
I can't tell you how many nights I've cried over the strain these chronic yeast infections have caused my relationship. We can never get in the mood because we're always scared it might come back. We can never have sex because we're scared it will come back. I can't tell you how many nights I cried, "Why me? Why is my body like this?".
When will it end? I wish my body wasn't like this. I wish I didn't have to deal with it. But, it makes me feel better knowing that a lot of you are going through the same thing as me. I realize, I'm not as alone as I thought I was. Thank you.

Hi.. new to the group and honestly I'm a little embarrassed.... I couldn't believe I found a support group like this... I was diagnosed with BV about a month ago and I had a baby 18 months ago that's when it started after I had her. The smell is so strong that I am so embarrassed I can't even wear leggings. I recently stopped having sex with my husband because I literally gag and cry of the embarrassment the smell causes.... I have NO stds, hormones are balanced, and nothing else came up in my lab work.. what can I do?

I'm new to the group. I'm so stressed out. I've lost my fiance because he feels I have contracted a disease from being unfaithful. I haven't even talked to anyone because of feeling so insecure about what I'm going thru. I've been eating yogurt and taking pro/prebiotic gummies and taking apple cider vinegar with the mother gummies...ladies, please help!! Am I doing what's right or hurting myself. I HATE being wet like this and the itching and burning sensation is the WORST!!! I'M a truck driver who don't have much time to stop and go to the doctor but I've been 3 times since last month for the same thing and nothing has helped thus far. Please help!!

**INEFFECTIVE CARE**
Confusion + misdiagnoses

*Social Media Post 4*
I've been wanting to post about this... ladies If you've been dealing with BV and nothing has helped and your doctor has no answers please get tested for both ureaplasma and mycoplasmas. If your doctor refuses to test you for these find a OB that will. This could be the reason for your bv struggles! Some OB's don't test for this and I don't understand why but it's a real thing. I had BV for 4/5 YEARS!! I had no idea that I had Ureaplasma and that was the cause for my reoccurring bv. I don't think I'm fully healed from my ureaplasma yet but I'm going to get retested soon. Please get tested for this if you haven't already.

I get that pain... but my doctor seems to think I've been misdiagnosed with BV for two years...
Idk about anyone else, but sometimes I feel like I know more about this infection than the people treating it.

Tested negative for ureplasma but I honestly wanna be tested again. I was tested while on the first day of my period which could've messed with test results. Doctor dosnt wanna test again and won't give me meds. I'm literally going to order doxy online. Can all of you who have had it tell me what meds they were given and for how long and if it worked ?

*Social Media Post 6*
If I have yeast does that mean I don't have cytolytic vaginosis or too much lactobacilli? I'm taking doxy for urethra burning and ureaplasma but it causes yeast and i want to use kefir and probiotics but i'm also afraid to over do it .... any differences in the symptoms?

Hannah, meet your microbiome.

| Microbe               | Percentage | Category   |
| :-------------------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| Lactobacillus crispatus | 41.12%     | PROTECTIVE |
| Prevotella bivia      | 10.34%     | NEUTRAL    |
| Corynebacterium       | 9.11%      | NEUTRAL    |
| Gardnerella vaginalis  | 8.73%      | DISRUPTIVE |

**WHAT TO KNOW**
*   Research has shown that Gardnerella vaginalis may be associated with bacterial vaginosis. G. vaginalis can catalyze an inflammatory immune response and damage vaginal cells.
*   It can also develop biofilm (a sticky, strong layer of infection cells) leading to difficult-to-treat bacterial vaginosis. The biofilm created by G. vaginalis may help other disruptive bacteria grow such as Atopobium.
*   Symptoms of the presence of this bacteria include abnormal discharge such as grey color or watery texture.

**ASSOCIATIONS**
*   BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS (BV)
*   PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS
*   CAN IMPACT FERTILITY
*   YEAST INFECTION

Prevotella bivia 6.55% (Note: This percentage seems to be cut off or part of a scrolling list, so it's noted as seen.)

We're building a repeatable playbook.
The vaginal microbiome is just the beginning.

(Visual progression of different microbiomes/biomarkers)

**Vaginal Microbiome**
*   Finding microbial biomarkers with a single swab.

(Dotted line connecting the images)

**Saliva**
**Blood**
**Urine**
**Gut Microbion** (Text cut off, likely "Microbiome")
*   Building our unique dataset on female-specific biomarkers with a suite of at-home tests
