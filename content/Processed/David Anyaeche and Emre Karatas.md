### ADVEX Pivot and Synthetic Data Journey

- Advex pivot from synthetic data generation to vision systems
	- Original synthetic data product worked on ~50% of use cases but lacked consistency
	- White glove service model, not true software product with poor unit economics
	- Technical risk: VLMs not advanced enough for reliable synthetic data generation
	- Talent acquisition challenge - couldn’t compete with companies like NVIDIA for research talent
- NVIDIA’s competitive advantage emerging
	- Building COSMOS for synthetics with AI apparatus deployment
	- Hiring deployed engineers for core foundational models
	- Strong corporate relationships with manufacturing firms through Omniverse
- Current pivot to VLM-based vision systems
	- Moving away from classical computer vision rule-based systems
	- Targeting system integrators as go-to-market channel
	- Three customer segments: Vision system companies (Cognex, Keyence), Automotive (Tier 1s like Brembo, OEMs like Toyota/BMW), System integrators

### Healthcare Technology Opportunities

- Vertical focus reduces technical complexity compared to horizontal approach
	- Robotics companies successfully using COSMOS for synthetic task simulations
	- Medical device integration represents untapped market similar to manufacturing
- Benjamin Allen Ray Hill connection
	- Former founding engineer at Neo-backed company using diffusion models for architects
	- Interested in biomedicine/life sciences applications over administrative healthcare
	- Co-applied to YC with chart review concept
- Medical device ecosystem gaps identified
	- Manual workflows, poor software integration across medical equipment
	- Need for “Plaid for medical devices” - unified data ingestion/extraction platform
	- Opportunity from smartwatch data to industrial X-ray machines
	- AI-powered biomedical equipment management potential

### Investment Thesis and Market Dynamics

- Hardware-software interface companies showing strong ROI potential
	- Moving beyond exhausted back-office administrative solutions
	- Focus on interfacing with medical equipment systems and devices
- Healthcare margin compression dynamics
	- Provider margins could increase from 15% to 30% with admin cost reduction
	- Fixed government payment pool creates balloon-squeezing effect
	- Policy shifts create opportunities but less permissionless than private company sales
- Examples of successful vertical approaches
	- Standard Model Bio: Multimodal foundation models for biopharma
	- ZoomRx: Life science supply chain with AI-assisted API integrations
	- CDMO batch record review solving real-world paper-based workflows
