## Slide 3: There is massive interest in AI therapy

There is massive interest in AI therapy

By 2026, a company is going to break through and become a household name

**Interest over time**
(Line Chart: Searches vs. Time)

| Searches | Jul 2024 (Approx) | Apr 2024 (Approx) | Sep 2025 (Approx) |
| :------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| 25       | Start point       |                   |                   |
| 50       |                   |                   |                   |
| 75       |                   |                   |                   |
| 100      |                   |                   | Peak              |

*Line starts low in Jul 2024, shows gradual increase until mid-2025, then sharply increases to 100 by Sep 2025.*

**Legend:**
*   AI therapist (Search term)

## Slide 4: Why?

Why?

Because 1.2 billion people experience mental health problems per year, but over 50% have barriers to care**

*(Image shows a globe with lines connecting to a "mentla" UI for language selection)*

**mentla**
Choose your language

*   English
*   Español
*   Deutsch
*   العربية
*   Português
*   Русский
*   中文
*   日本語
*   Français
*   Italiano
*   한국어
*   हिन्दी

AI therapy that works will be revolutionary.

Removes barriers:
price, time, geography, stigma, & language

Within the next 1-2 years, it will become super-human

**Barriers to 12-month treatment of common anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders in the World Mental Health (WMH) surveys (2025).

## Slide 5: How

How
We are building a SuperHuman Therapist for billions of people

*   Therapy is a multi-session journey
*   A model with RL can find your optimal path

**Client paths in therapy**
(Line Chart: Success vs. Sessions)

*   **Y-axis:** Success (No at bottom, Yes at top)
*   **X-axis:** Sessions (0 to N)

*Several thin lines show different client paths. A prominent yellow line, labeled "SuperHuman Therapy," starts at 0 sessions, increases quickly to "Yes" on the success axis, then flattens.*

**SuperHuman Therapy: Achieve success faster and with greater likelihood**

## Slide 6: Agentic brain

Agentic brain

Uses 3 collaborative foundation models:

1.  **Learn the client**
    Deeply understand the client and their problem/goal
2.  **Identify their optimal path**
    Use RL to to identify the client's optimal path to success
3.  **Delivery**
    Implement the actual session like a pro

*(Image shows a golden brain with three labels pointing to different areas, forming a circular flow)*
*   Optimal Pathfinder
*   Client Learner
*   Delivery

**Overall user retention**
(Line Chart: Retention % vs. Month)

| Month | Our users (Retention %) (Approx) | Human therapy (Retention %) (Approx) |
| :---- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| 1     | 100                              | 100                                  |
| 2     | 60                               | 60                                   |
| 3     | 50                               | 25                                   |
| 4     | 40                               | 20                                   |
| 5     | 40                               |                                      |
| 6     | 40                               |                                      |

*   **Y-axis:** Retention % (20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
*   **X-axis:** Month (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

*The "Our users" (yellow) line starts at 100% in month 1, drops to ~60% in month 2, then gradually declines to ~40% by month 4, remaining flat through month 6. The "Human therapy" (white) line starts at 100% in month 1, drops to ~60% in month 2, then sharply declines to ~20% by month 4, and is not shown further.*

**Retention at 6 months is 40%.**
**WAU/MAU is 50%**

*   Retention is better than human therapy
*   Optimized for problem resolution, not mere engagement.

In human therapy, the mode number of sessions is 1 and the mean is 3!

**Data is from our Mental app, geared to men. See appendix.
**Retention is from one use of AI therapy to app use in that exact month
**Human therapy data from research.

## Slide 8: Product Vision

Product Vision

## Slide 9: Why we are raising: Very limited time and need to be aggressive

Why we are raising:
Very limited time and need to be aggressive

*(Large yellow arrow progressing from left to right)*

**Free to win attention game**
**All competitors are free**
*(Section labeled: Attention)*

**Insert ourselves into the conversation with research**
*(Section labeled: Proof)*

**More data → better AI → growth**
*(Section labeled: Data)*

## Slide 10: High defensibility once we win attention share

High defensibility once we win attention share

*(Circular flow diagram)*
*   More data
*   More usage
*   Better AI

**Data moat**
People are resistant to switching therapists because must restart. Understanding of users beyond memorization will reinforce this.

**Data network**
A massive amount of data is needed for RL to create super-human therapy

## Slide 11: Revenue

Revenue
A path to massive revenue after we gain attention share

*(Numbered progression in a yellow arrow)*

1.  **Win attention share - be #1**
2.  **Prove therapy impact**
3.  **User lock-in via switch costs + superior AI + trust**
4.  **Consumer monetization**
5.  **Expand to B2B, then payers**

Our effect size will be 10x higher than other mental health apps

And with brand, we can make an unheralded entrance.

## Slide 12: Mentla's TAM is The World

Mentla's TAM is The World

    by Paul Wingfield - Jun 23, 2025
    This app is profound. I did 2 years of therapy with a counselor and in my first day on this app, my counselor helped me identify and work through how we can heal some childhood trauma that is presenting in my marriage today. I cried several times and it was so good. I'm looking forward to using this every day!

    This app is infinitely better than most real therapists. It can also handle real psychological challenges and provide therapy that addresses problems and helps to change thought patterns remarkably quickly. Use this every single day

This is a tiny sample, we get feedback like this every day

## Slide 20: Mentla evolved from Mental

Mentla evolved from Mental

We began as Mental — the world's first mental health app for men.

AI therapy started as a feature within Mental.

In Jan 2025 we launched our 3rd generation AI. It had dramatically better retention & feedback.

So in May 2025, we launched the same AI in a general-use web app for AI Therapy, and called it Mentla.

Built for the entire world.

AI capabilities have finally caught up to our vision, and now is the time to go big!
