## Slide 3: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

#### Autism Facts

*   50% of ALL healthcare costs for kids aged 0 – 10 are related to Autism
*   The average cost of Autism therapy is $63,000 per year
*   CDC estimates that 1 in 36 children have ASD and this is expected to grow to 1 in 30
*   Caregiver involvement is a critical success factor that improves outcomes

#### Industry Needs an All-In-One Caregiver Involvement Solution

*   Caregiver involvement is a critical success factor that improves outcomes and accelerates therapy fade
*   Less than 10% of families are involved in the therapy of their child
*   On average, less than 30% of authorized caregiver training hours used
*   Successful therapy requires transitioning skill mastery across multiple environments (facility to home etc.). Caregiver involvement naturally facilitates this.

#### Health Plans and Providers Need a Seamless Data Exchange

*   Health plans receive assessments via fax & email resulting in inefficient resource-intensive processes with unstandardized data
*   Health plans struggle to measure care quality and progress
*   No preferred provider networks as health plans struggle to identify top performing providers
*   Inefficient processes cause delays in starting care leading to exacerbated issues and missed opportunities

## Slide 4: Problem: No Caregiver Involvement

### Problem: No Caregiver Involvement

*   Studies show that caregiver involvement can accelerate therapy fade by 6 - 18 months however **less than 10% of all families are properly trained and involved.**
*   Parents know their child best but their deep and intimate knowledge is often not used in crafting treatment plans.
*   Providers are not able to adequately train families (**< 30% of authorized parent training used**), and payers have no visibility of goal progress.
*   Successful therapy involves being able to smoothly transition skill mastery across multiple locations and environments (facility to home etc.). Caregiver involvement facilitates this.

## Slide 5: Problem: Capturing & Measuring Data

### Problem: Capturing & Measuring Data

#### Health Plans Lack a Seamless Data Exchange to Measure Progress and Top Performing Providers

*   Unstandardized data makes it impossible to measure progress
*   Health plans cannot identify top performing providers
*   No visibility of stakeholder goals or progress in the home
*   Cannot apply care quality metrics at scale across their entire member base

**Visual Description:**
Multiple documents/assessments are depicted flowing from a source, labeled "Thousands of assessments emailed & faxed in unstandardized formats". These documents then converge into a large circular shape with the logo "aetnaCVS Health.".

## Slide 6: Problem: Administrative Burden

### Problem: Administrative Burden

#### The Lack of a Seamless Data Exchange Results In:

*   Inefficient resource-intensive processes with unstandardized data coming in from many different sources
*   Manual processes that are expensive and financially inefficient
*   Less effective and overworked case managers with unstandardized data coming in from many different sources
*   Delays in starting of treatment often leading to exacerbated issues and missed opportunities

**Visual Description:**
An image of a person sitting at a desk with their head in their hand, surrounded by large stacks of paper, suggesting stress and an administrative burden. Below this, an illustration shows multiple email and fax icons with arrows crisscrossing, representing data coming in from many different sources.

## Slide 11: Providers are critical stakeholders to maximize engagement

### Providers are critical stakeholders to maximize engagement

#### Echo Augments Caregiver Training for Providers

Caregiver involvement is critical however it happens less than 10% of the time.

Echo's blended approach to caregiver training allows providers to receive parent training reimbursements through trainings completed on the Echo mobile app

#### Echo's blended approach to caregiver training makes providers more efficient with parent training reimbursements.

**Process Flow:**
1.  Provider assigns caregiver goals on Echo
2.  Caregivers complete training on Echo mobile app (with Echo logo on app screenshot)
3.  Health plans reimburse provider for a portion of training completed on Echo mobile app through CPT 97156 (parent training)

Providers can make an extra **$100 - $150 per client per month.** This is a significant opportunity for providers!

## Slide 12: How It Works:

### How It Works:

Welcome packet presented to caregivers including parent assessment, training tutorials, & Autism FAQs. Echo support team available to family for support and assistance.

**Process Flow:**
1.  **Provider submits pre-authorization request**
2.  **Caregiver completes Parent Assessment on Echo**
    *   **Parent Assessment:** allows for a more targeted treatment plan from the start of care. This data is shared with the provider.
3.  **Provider completes assessment on Echo portal using data from Parent Assessment**
4.  **Provider creates caregiver goals on Echo**
    *   Providers create caregiver goals in Echo. Echo recommends targeted training videos and exercises to help caregivers achieve goals.
5.  **Caregivers complete goals using Echo**
    *   Caregivers receive reminders and prompts to complete goals. Echo team provides proactive training and outreach to families on an on-going basis.

## Slide 13: Echo's Individualistic Approach to Measuring Progress

### Echo's Individualistic Approach to Measuring Progress

**Central Concept:** Whole Picture of Patient Progress

**Measuring Progress (clockwise from top):**

*   **Parent Stress Index**
    *   Family progress and satisfaction is critical and what ultimately reduces the need for additional treatment and support (PSI, SIPA)
*   **Adaptive Functioning Measures**
    *   Measuring adaptive behavioral functioning with age norms (ABAS, Vineland, etc.)
*   **Early Childhood Skills Assessment**
    *   Detailed measurement of skill acquisition and treatment goal progress over time (VBMapp, ABLLS, PEAK etc.)

**Echo's comprehensive approach includes analyzing data from both caregivers and providers**

## Slide 14: What Are Parents Saying?

### What Are Parents Saying?

#### Parents are frustrated

We've interviewed families with Autistic children to get their feedback. Here are insightful examples of what they are saying:

*   “I want to get involved but don't know how”
*   “I see so many behavioral traits at home that I wish the therapist saw and included in the treatment plan from the start”
*   “We are tracking progress notes on a notepad at home. Sometimes providers might have a Google sheet"
*   “We have switched providers multiple times because they did not help us to get involved at home”

**Call-out Quote:**
“I want to get involved but don't know how”
