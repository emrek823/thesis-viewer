## Slide 2: Executive Summary
# Executive Summary
**Why.** The app layer is becoming commoditized with LLMs - all that matters is data and distribution. Shared services across data (PurpleLab) and distribution (Virtue) can fund ~5 companies with <$5M each to target $200-$500M outcomes.

**What is it.** Incubating and launching software/AI businesses in healthcare and life sciences with goal to reach $20M-$50M in ARR on top of PurpleLab's data asset.

**How it works.** PurpleLab provides data for equity / revenue share. Venture partner pays for compute, storage, egress, and owns initial ideation for first design partner, and hiring for initial team - FDE, GM (mini-CEO), and AE.

**Benefit to Virtue.** Discounted access to data (value of $500K - $1M annually per company)

**Benefit to PurpleLab.** PL wants to become a first party data originator and get rights in Claims, structured EHR and unstructured documents and notes as a by-product of revenue generating activities, and capture additional upside for next phase of growth over next 2-3 years they can't build themselves.

## Slide 5: Hold Co / Op Co Structure
# Hold Co / Op Co Structure

**Diagram Description:**
The diagram illustrates the structural relationship between PurpleLab (PL), Oxygen (AI Hold Co), Virtue, and several Operating Companies (OpCos).

-   **PL:** Provides data and input on ideation.
-   **Oxygen (AI Hold Co w/ $500K annual spend):**
    -   Common tech infrastructure (Foundry)
    -   Talent (Sage/Samir type + CTO)
    -   Spun out with $1M after Oxygen secures first customer.
-   **virtue.:** Provides capital, talent, access to customers + input on ideation.

Oxygen acts as a central holding company for multiple operating companies (OpCos).
-   **OpCo #1:**
    -   HoldCo: 60%
    -   PL: 10%
    -   GM: 25%
    -   ESOP: 5%
    -   *Note:* Strong initial momentum and path to $10M ARR; no additional capital.
-   **OpCo #2:**
    -   HoldCo: 40%
    -   PL: 10%
    -   GM: 50%
    -   ESOP: 10%
    -   *Note:* Strong initial momentum and path to $10M ARR; Raises additional $2-$3M.
-   **#3, #4, #5, YY:** Placeholder boxes for additional OpCos.

**Key Points on Dynamics:**
The dynamics of the hold co / op co structure will evolve (structure not bottleneck) but key points are:
-   Cost to maintain, launch, and get to scale is stagegated and capital efficient
-   Where talent sits
-   Relative % ownership reflective of work done (and upside opportunity)

## Slide 6: Next steps
# Next steps
*   WriteWise can use this data today - is it valuable? Y/N (suspect strong Y)
*   Sage wants this data - does the PL / Virtue structure work or is it too complicated?
*   Is the vision for multiple companies realistic (based off 1 and 2)?
