Sarah Teichmann, PhD

Sarah did her PhD at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK and was a Beit Memorial Fellow at University College London. She started her group at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 2001, where they described conserved pathways of protein complex assembly, and a “periodic table of protein complexes”, using biophysics and data science. After starting work on single cell genomics of T cells, in 2013, she moved to the Wellcome Genome Campus where she was the first and to date only faculty member appointed across both the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Sanger Institute. There, she was a founding member of the Sanger-EBI Single Cell Genomics Centre.  In 2016, Sarah was appointed as Head of the Cellular Genetics programme at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and co-founded the international Human Cell Atlas consortium. This initiative creates reference maps for cells across all human tissues, and has grown to include over three thousand members across the world. She also co-directs the CIFAR MacMillan Multiscale Human research programme.

From April 2024, Sarah has taken up the chair in Stem Cell Medicine at the University of Cambridge, Department of Medicine/Cambridge Stem Cell Institute. She now also spends part of her time at GlaxoSmithKline, and the startup company she co-founded, EnsoCell Therapeutics.

While maintaining a molecular and biophysics perspective, Sarah’s laboratory has developed and applied experimental and computational approaches for cell atlas technologies to decipher human cells, tissues and organs. A particular focus of hers is how cellular diversity is generated in the immune system and through development. Notable achievements include the first comprehensive reconstruction of the cell interactions in the human placenta in early pregnancy, and the first 3D map of the developing and mature thymus at cellular resolution and full molecular depth. Her work has been recognised by numerous awards, including the EMBO Gold Medal, Genetics Society Mary Lyons Award, Biochemical Society GlaxoSmithKline Award, the FEBS|EMBO Women in Science Award, Raman Chair of the Indian Academy of Sciences among others. She is an EMBO Member, ISCB Fellow, International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences and Royal Society.

Andrea Califano, PhD

Andrea Califano is the Clyde and Helen Wu Professor of Chemical and Systems Biology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and also holds appointments in the Departments of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, Biomedical Informatics, and Medicine. He just stepped down from his positions as Founding Chair of the Department of Systems Biology and Director of the Columbia Genome Center, to take a new role as the President of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub New York.  
  
In 1986, after completing a doctoral thesis in physics at the University of Florence, Italy, Dr. Califano joined the IBM TJ Watson Research Center, where, in 1997, he became program director of the IBM Computational Biology Center. In 2000, he co-founded First Genetic Trust Inc. to pursue translational genomics research. Finally, he joined Columbia in 2003.

Dr. Califano is an internationally recognized pioneer in the reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks and in their analysis to systematically and efficiently identify key tumor checkpoint modules, whose aberrant activity is necessary for tumor viability. This has resulted in several clinical trials, including a very innovative N-of-1 study where patients affected by 14 untreatable, lethal cancers are analyzed on an individual basis to prioritize optimal therapeutic strategies, including both single drugs and drug combinations.  
  
Dr. Califano is very active nationally, serving on numerous editorial and scientific advisory boards, including the Board of Scientific Advisors of the National Cancer Institute, St. Jude Children’s Hospital, The MIT Koch Cancer Center, Cancer Genetics Inc., and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., among others. He has served as Chair or Co-chair of many international conferences and meetings, including the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR); the RECOMB-ISCB Conference
