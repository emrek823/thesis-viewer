# RUPA, INC. Series FF Stock Purchase Agreement

This Series FF Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made as of January 28, 2019 by and between Rupa, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) and Tara Viswanathan (the “Purchaser”). In consideration of the mutual covenants and representations set forth below, the Company and the Purchaser agree as follows:

## 1. Sale of Stock.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties or on such other date as the Company and Purchaser shall agree (the "Purchase Date”), the Company will issue and sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company, 500,000 shares of the Company's Series FF Preferred Stock (the “Shares”) at a purchase price of $.0001 per share (“Per Share Price”), which aggregates to a total purchase price of $50.00 (the "Aggregate Purchase Price”).

## 2. Closing.
In consideration for the purchase of the Shares hereunder, on the Purchase Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the Company an executed copy of this Agreement and a check in an amount equal to the Aggregate Purchase Price, and the Company will enter the Shares in Purchaser's name in the books and records of the Company or, if applicable, with a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company. The Company will deliver to Purchaser, upon request, a notice of issuance of the Shares as soon as practicable following the Purchase Date. The term “Shares" refers to all of the Shares purchased hereunder, all securities received in connection with the Shares pursuant to stock dividends or splits, all securities received in replacement of the Shares in a recapitalization, merger, reorganization, exchange or the like, and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property to which Purchaser is entitled by reason of Purchaser's ownership of the Shares.

## 3. Restrictions on Transfer

### A. Acknowledgement.
The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Shares are subject to certain restrictions on transfer, such as (i) the terms and conditions set forth in the Company's Bylaws concerning Company capital stock that may be in effect at the time of a proposed transfer, including (without limitation) the current Section 8.9 thereof, (the “Bylaw Provisions”), (ii) the lock-up period set forth in Section 3.E below, and (iv) applicable securities laws and regulations.

### B. Legend Requirements.
The Purchaser understands and agrees that the Company shall cause the legends set forth below, or substantially equivalent legends, to be placed upon any certificate(s) evidencing ownership of the Shares, together with any other legends that may be required by the Company or by applicable state or federal securities laws:

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE “ACT”) AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR, IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES, SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE ACT.

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AS SET FORTH IN THE SECTION 8.9 OF THE COMPANY'S BYLAWS, A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL, AND A LOCK-UP PERIOD IN THE EVENT OF A PUBLIC OFFERING, EACH AS SET FORTH IN BYLAWS OF THE CORPORATION AND/OR THE SERIES FF STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE ORIGINAL HOLDER OF THESE SHARES, A COPY OF EACH MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE ISSUER. SUCH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL, LOCK-UP PERIOD ARE BINDING ON TRANSFEREES OF THESE SHARES.

### C. Stop-Transfer Notices.
The Purchaser agrees that the Company may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent, if any, to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein; and, if the Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own records.

### D. Refusal to Transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any Shares that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) to treat as owner of such Shares or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such Shares shall have been so transferred.

### E. Lock-Up Period.
If so requested by the Company or the underwriters in connection with the initial public offering of the Company's securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Purchaser or a subsequent transferee shall not directly or indirectly sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any securities of the Company however or whenever acquired (except for those being registered) without the prior written consent of the Company or such underwriters, as the case may be, for 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement, plus such additional period, to the extent required by FINRA rules, up to a maximum of 216 days from the effective date of the registration statement, and Purchaser shall execute an agreement reflecting the foregoing as may be requested by the underwriters at the time of such offering. This Section 3.E shall apply and be binding upon any new, substituted or additional securities of the Company that are distributed to the Purchaser without the payment of consideration and as a result of Purchaser's ownership of the Shares (such a distribution occurring as a result of a declaration of a stock dividend, a spin-off, a stock split, an adjustment in conversion ratio, a recapitalization or other similar transaction). This Section 3.E shall apply and be binding to transferees of the Purchaser.

### F. Transfer Compliance.
No Shares purchased under this Agreement, nor any beneficial interest in such Shares, shall be sold, transferred, encumbered or otherwise disposed of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by the Purchaser or any subsequent transferee, other than in compliance with the Bylaw Provisions and the Company's right of first refusal set forth below.

## 4. Company's Right of First Refusal.
Before any Shares acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (or any beneficial interest in such Shares) may be sold, transferred, encumbered or otherwise disposed of in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by the Purchaser or any subsequent transferee (each a “Holder”), such Holder must first offer such Shares or beneficial interest to the Company and/or its assignee(s) as follows:

### A. Notice of Proposed Transfer.
The Holder shall deliver to the Company a written notice stating: (i) the Holder's bona fide intention to sell or otherwise transfer the Shares; (ii) the name of each proposed transferee; (iii) the number of Shares to be transferred to each proposed transferee; (iv) the bona fide cash price or other consideration for which the Holder proposes to transfer the Shares; and (v) that by delivering the notice, the Holder offers all such Shares to the Company and/or its assignee(s) pursuant to this Section 4 and on the same terms described in the notice.

### B. Exercise of Right of First Refusal.
At any time within 30 days after receipt of the Holder's notice, the Company and/or its assignee(s) may, by giving written notice to the Holder, elect to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Shares proposed to be transferred to any one or more of the proposed transferees, at the purchase price listed in the Holder's notice. If the price listed in the Holder's notice includes consideration other than cash, the cash equivalent value of the non-cash consideration shall be determined by the Board of the Company in its sole discretion. Payment of the purchase price shall be made, at the option of the Company and/or its assignee(s), in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding indebtedness of the Holder to the Company and/or its assignee(s), or by any combination thereof within 30 days after receipt by the Company of the Holder's notice (or at such later date as is called for by such notice).

### C. Holder's Right to Transfer.
If all of the Shares proposed in the notice to be transferred to a proposed transferee are not purchased by the Company and/or its assignee(s) as provided in this Section 4, then the Holder may sell or otherwise transfer such Shares to that proposed transferee; provided that: (i) the transfer is made only on the terms provided for in the notice (except that the purchase price may be higher than as stated in the notice); (ii) such transfer is consummated within 60 days of the date the notice was delivered to the Company (“Notice Date”); (iii) the transfer is effected in accordance with any applicable securities laws, and if requested by the Company, the Holder shall have delivered an attorney's opinion acceptable to the Company to that effect; and (iv) the proposed transferee agrees in writing that the Shares will be subject to all provisions of this Agreement, including the terms of this Section 4. If a proposed transfer of Shares is not consummated within 60 days of the Notice Date, then before any transfer of Shares, a new notice shall be delivered to the Company and/or its assignees, and they shall again be offered the right of first refusal described in this Section 4.

### D. Exception for Certain Family Transfers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4, the transfer of any or all of the Shares during Holder's lifetime or on Holder's death by will or intestacy to Holder's Immediate Family or a trust for the benefit of Holder or Holder's Immediate Family shall be exempt from the provisions of this Section 4; provided, however, that the transfer restrictions of the Bylaw Provisions and this Agreement shall continue to apply to the Shares after such a transfer. For the purpose of this Agreement, “Immediate Family” shall mean any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law and shall include adoptive relationships.

### E. Termination of Right of First Refusal.
The right of first refusal contained in this Section 4 shall terminate as to all Shares upon the earlier of: (i) the closing date of the first sale of Common Stock of the Company to the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), and (ii) the closing date of a Change of Control pursuant to which the holders of the outstanding voting securities of the Company receive securities of a class registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

## 5. Investment Representations

### A. Purchaser is aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the Shares.
Purchaser is purchasing the Shares for investment for Purchaser's own account only and not with any intent for resale in connection with any “distribution” thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act or under any applicable provision of state law. Purchaser does not have any present intention to transfer the Shares to any other person or entity.

### B. Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of Purchaser's investment intent as expressed herein.

### C. Purchaser will offer, sell, pledge or otherwise transfer the Purchased Shares only pursuant to registration under the Securities Act or an available exemption and in accordance with all applicable state and foreign securities laws.

### D. Purchaser consents to the Company making a notation on its records or giving instructions to any transfer agent of the Company in order to implement the restrictions on transfer of the Securities set forth in this Agreement.

### E. Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the securities must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available.
Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the securities.

### F. Purchaser is familiar with the provisions of Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, which, permits limited public resale of “restricted securities” acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer of the securities (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
Purchaser understands that the Company provides no assurances as to whether Purchaser will be able to resell any or all of the Shares pursuant to Rule 144, which rule requires, among other things, that the Company be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, that resales of securities take place only after the holder of the Shares has held the Shares for certain specified time periods, and under certain circumstances, that resales of securities be limited in volume and take place only pursuant to brokered transactions. Notwithstanding this Section 5.F, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees to the restrictions set forth in Section 5.G below.

### G. Purchaser further understands that in the event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.

### H. Purchaser represents that Purchaser is not subject to any of the "Bad Actor” disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the Securities Act.
Purchaser also agrees to notify the Company if Purchaser becomes subject to such disqualifications after the date hereof.

### I. Purchaser understands that Purchaser may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of Purchaser's purchase and disposition of the Shares.
Purchaser represents that Purchaser has consulted any tax consultants Purchaser deems advisable in connection with the purchase or disposition of the Shares and that Purchaser is not relying on the Company for any tax advice.

## 6. General Provisions

For all purposes under this Agreement, the term “Company” shall include any successor to the Company's business and/or assets which executes and delivers an assumption agreement described in this Section or becomes bound by the terms of this Agreement by operation of law. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon the Purchaser and his or her heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

### F. Waiver.
Either party's failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any such provision, nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing any other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted both parties hereunder are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of either party's right to assert any other legal remedy available to it.

### G. Purchaser Investment Representations and Further Documents.
The Purchaser agrees upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or reasonably desirable in the view of the Company to carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement, including (but not limited to) the applicable exhibits and attachments to this Agreement.

Upon such transfer, the Purchaser shall have no further rights as a holder of the Shares so purchased except (in the case of a transfer to the Company) the right to receive payment for the Shares so purchased in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the Purchaser shall forthwith cause the certificate(s) evidencing the Shares so purchased to be surrendered to the Company for transfer or cancellation.

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY THE AAA RULES AND THIS AGREEMENT, ARBITRATION SHALL BE THE SOLE, EXCLUSIVE AND FINAL REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PURCHASER AND THE COMPANY. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, THE PARTIES WILL BE ENTITLED TO APPLY FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF IN THE COURTS. BOTH PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ANY BREACH OR THREATENED BREACH OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE INJURY FOR WHICH MONEY DAMAGES WILL NOT PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE REMEDY, AND BOTH PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN INJUNCTION. IF EITHER PARTY SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, THE PREVAILING PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER REASONABLE COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT PURCHASER IS EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT ANY DURESS OR UNDUE INFLUENCE BY THE COMPANY OR ANYONE ELSE.

As a condition to beginning or continuing my employment relationship (“Employment Relationship") with Rupa, Inc., a Delaware corporation (including all of its directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns, the “Company”), and in consideration of my employment with the Company, my receipt of compensation now and hereafter paid to me by the Company, my receipt of Company capital stock issued to me, if any, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, I hereby agree to the following terms and conditions of this Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement (the “Agreement”):

## 1. RELATIONSHIP.
I understand and acknowledge that my Employment Relationship is “at-will", meaning that there is no promise of employment for a specific period of time and that my Employment Relationship may be terminated by the Company at any time with or without notice, for any lawful reason, with or without cause. I acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement modifies my at-will employment status.

## 2. CONFIDENTIALITY.

### B. USE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
At all times during my Employment Relationship and for a period of 2 years thereafter, I agree, unless I obtain prior express written consent from the Company, to hold in strictest confidence, and not use or disclose to any party, except for the benefit of Company and to the extent necessary to perform my obligations to Company, any Company Confidential Information. Furthermore, I will not copy, reproduce, decompile, deconstruct, reverse engineer or make derivative works of Company Confidential Information in an attempt to circumvent the intent of this Agreement.

### C. Former Employer Information.
At all times during my Employment Relationship, I will not improperly use or disclose any Confidential Information of any former employer, entity, person, or other third party to which I am bound to an obligation of confidentiality; furthermore, I will not bring any such Confidential Information onto the other premises of Company.

### D. Prior Period.
If, prior to the Effective Date (the “Prior Period”), I provided services to or for the benefit of the Company in anticipation of my Employment Relationship, which services would have been within the scope of my duties if performed under this Agreement, then I hereby agree to treat any information that the Company disclosed to me during the Prior Period that would have qualified as “Company Confidential Information” if such information were governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as if it were Company Confidential Information governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

## 3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

### A. Definitions.
For the purposes of this Agreement:

i. “Invention” means any computer code, software or other programs, discovery, development, concept, method, design, plan, process, technique, idea, know how, improvement, invention, trade secret and/or original work of authorship, new product, machine, article of manufacture, biological material, procedure, use, equipment, device, apparatus, system, compound, formulation, composition of matter, drawing, diagram or configuration of any kind, or any improvement thereon, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable;

ii. “Company Invention” means any and all Inventions that I, solely or jointly with others, author, discover, develop, conceive, or reduce to practice during the Employment Relationship; provided, however, that a Company Invention is not an invention which qualifies fully for exclusion under the provisions of applicable law (if any);

iii. “Intellectual Property Rights” means any rights associated with an Invention, including, without limitation, any (a) patent and patent rights, (b) trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and corporate names (in each case, whether registered or unregistered), including all goodwill associated therewith, (c) copyrights (registered or unregistered) and works of authorship, (d) computer software, data, databases and documentation thereof, (e) trade secrets, (f) “moral rights,” “artist's rights,” “droit moral,” “mask work rights", or other common law rights and (g) all rights, remedies against infringements and rights to protect such interests; and

iv. “Prior Invention” means any Invention, excluding Company Inventions, that (a) I developed prior to the Employment Relationship, (b) was not developed for, in consideration of, or in relation to the Company, and (c) in which I have a right, title or interest.

### B. Invention Assignment.
I hereby assign and agree to assign to the Company all of my right, title and interest in and to any and all Company Inventions, including any Intellectual Property Rights arising therefrom. Furthermore, I agree to promptly make full written disclosure to Company of any Company Invention, which I agree hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of Company. To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, I agree and acknowledge that any Company Invention that I make, solely or jointly with others, during the Employment Relationship are “works made for hire” in exchange for the consideration provided hereunder. I understand and agree that the decision whether or not to commercialize or market any Company Invention is within the Company's sole discretion and for the Company's sole benefit and that no royalty or other consideration will be due to me as a result of the Company's efforts to commercialize or market any such Inventions. I understand and acknowledge that to the extent that any Inventions created under this Agreement would qualify for exclusion from assignment under applicable state law (such as Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, which is attached hereto as Exhibit A), such Inventions shall be excluded from assignment hereunder. In order to assist in the determination of which inventions qualify for such exclusion, I will advise Company promptly in writing of all Inventions solely or jointly conceived or developed or reduced to practice by me during the Employment Relationship.

### C. Prior Invention License.
I have attached hereto as Exhibit B, a list describing all Prior Inventions, which are excluded from assignment under this Agreement; or, if no such list is attached, I represent and warrant that there are no such Prior Inventions. Furthermore, I represent and warrant that the inclusion of any Prior Inventions listed on Exhibit B of this Agreement will not materially affect my ability to perform all obligations under this Agreement. If I use or incorporate any Prior Invention into any Company Invention, I will promptly inform Company in writing; regardless of whether or not I provide such notice to Company, I hereby irrevocably grant to Company a nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, assumable, perpetual, worldwide license, with right to transfer and to sublicense, to practice and exploit any Company Invention that incorporates a Prior Invention and to make, copy, modify, make derivative works of, use, sell, import, and otherwise distribute such Company Invention under all applicable intellectual property laws without restriction of any kind.

I will document all such records in a commercially reasonable format, and will make such records available to the Company at all times.

Upon termination of the Employment Relationship, I agree to promptly deliver all such records and copies thereof to the Company.

If I am unable to execute or file any such Applications, I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney-in-fact to execute and file any such Applications, and to do all other lawfully permitted acts reasonably necessary or desirable to protect Company's rights to and interests in any Company Inventions; I further acknowledge that this power of attorney is coupled with an interest.

### F. Incorporation of Software Code.
I agree that I will not incorporate into any Company Inventions or otherwise deliver to Company any software code licensed under the GNU General Public License or Lesser General Public License or any similar license that, by its terms, requires or conditions the use or distribution of such code on the disclosure, licensing or distribution of any source code owned or licensed by Company except in compliance with Company's policies regarding use of such software.

## 4. RETURN OF MATERIALS.
Upon termination of the Employment Relationship, I will promptly deliver to the Company all originals and any copies of all documents, materials, property, and Confidential Information in my control, custody and possession.

## 5. NON-SOLICITATION.
During my Employment Relationship and for twelve months thereafter, I will not without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or in combination or association with any other person or entity, whether as a partner, member, officer, director, employee, creditor, shareholder, or otherwise (A) solicit for hire or engagement, any Company employee or consultant with whom I had contact with during the last six months of my Employment Relationship, or (B) solicit any Company employee or consultant with whom I had contact with during the last six months of my Employment Relationship to terminate its relationship with the Company. During my Employment Relationship, I will not, directly or indirectly, influence any party with whom the Company does business (each, a “Business Partner”) from purchasing products or services offered by the Company (“Company Goods”); nor will I influence, directly or indirectly, any Business Partner to purchase products and/or services competitive with Company Goods from any person or entity in competition with the business of the Company.

## 6. SERVICE PROVIDER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS.
I hereby represent and warrant to Company that (A) my execution of this Agreement does not and will not conflict with or result in any breach or default under any other agreement to which I am subject; (B) I will not enter into any agreement or understanding that will conflict with this Agreement; and (C) I will perform my obligations under this Agreement in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Furthermore, I agree that during my Employment Relationship with the Company, I will not, without Company's express written consent, directly or indirectly engage in any employment or business activity which is directly or indirectly competitive with, or would otherwise conflict with, my Employment Relationship with the Company.

## 7. REASONABLENESS OF RESTRICTION.
I acknowledge that the restrictive covenants in this Agreement (A) do not constitute a total restraint on my ability to earn a living, (B) are necessary to preserve the legitimate business interests of the Company, (C) are essential elements of this Agreement, and (D) are fair and reasonable notwithstanding expense or hardship they may impose on me.

## 8. EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
I acknowledge that my breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable damage to Company and hereby agree that Company will be entitled to seek injunctive relief or any other equitable relief available to it under this Agreement, as well as such further relief as may be granted by an arbitrator, if any, or a court of competent jurisdiction.

## 9. TERMINATION CERTIFICATION.
Upon termination of my Employment Relationship for any reason, I agree to immediately sign and deliver to the Company the “Termination Certification” attached hereto as Exhibit C. Following such termination, I also agree to keep the Company advised of my home and business address for a period of six (6) months so that the Company can contact me in regards to any matters concerning the enforcement of this Agreement.

## 10. ARBITRATION.
I AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM ARISING UNDER OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EMPLOYMENT ARBITRATION RULES AND MEDIATION PROCEDURES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) BEFORE AN ARBITRATOR MUTUALLY AGREED UPON BY ME AND THE COMPANY. IF THE COMPANY AND I CANNOT AGREE UPON AN ARBITRATOR, THE AAA WILL APPOINT A SINGLE ARBITRATOR. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY THE AAA RULES AND THIS AGREEMENT, ARBITRATION SHALL BE THE SOLE, EXCLUSIVE AND FINAL REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN ME AND THE COMPANY. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, THE COMPANY OR I WILL BE ENTITLED TO APPLY FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF IN THE COURTS. I UNDERSTAND THAT ANY BREACH OR THREATENED BREACH OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE INJURY FOR WHICH MONEY DAMAGES WILL NOT PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE REMEDY, AND I HEREBY CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN INJUNCTION. BOTH THE COMPANY AND I AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PREVAILING PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER REASONABLE COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT I AM EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT ANY DURESS OR UNDUE INFLUENCE BY THE COMPANY OR ANYONE ELSE. I REPRESENT THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THE TERMS, CONSEQUENCES AND BINDING EFFECT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THAT I AM WAIVING MY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. FINALLY, I AGREE THAT I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF AN ATTORNEY BEFORE SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT.

## 11. U.S. DEFEND TRADE SECRETS ACT OF 2016.
Company acknowledges that notwithstanding any other term or provision hereof, the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (“DTSA”) provides that I shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made (A) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (C) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and that if I file a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law, I may disclose the trade secret to my attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, so long as I (i) file any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (ii) do not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

## 12. MISCELLANEOUS.

### A. No Employment Right.
I agree and acknowledge that nothing in this Agreement, nor the Employment Relationship itself, shall confer any right to me with respect to the continuation of the Employment Relationship by the Company. Furthermore, I agree and acknowledge that the Employment Relationship is at-will, which means that I or the Company may terminate the Employment Relationship at any time, for any reason or no reason at all, with or without advance notice and with or without cause.

### B. Assignment.
I will not assign or delegate any of my rights or responsibilities, in whole or in part, arising under this Agreement without the written consent of Company.

### C. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.
I agree that any disputes and actions arising from this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. I hereby (i) submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state of California concerning any dispute arising directly or indirectly from this Agreement that is not subject to the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 10 hereof; and (ii) agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in the state and federal courts located in California.

### D. Waiver of Trial by Jury.
I hereby waive my right to a jury trial to the extent that any dispute arising under this Agreement is to be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction.

### E. Survival.
I agree and acknowledge that upon termination of the Employment Relationship, Sections 2 through 5, Sections 7 through 12, and all other provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination or expiration, shall survive.

### F. Severability.
I agree and acknowledge that if any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, then such provision shall be modified by the court or arbitrator, if any, to be enforceable under the maximum extent allowed by law, and if such provision is found to be unenforceable to any extent, then such provision shall be completely excluded from this Agreement, and the remainder of the Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

### G. Entire Agreement.
I agree and acknowledge that this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, understandings and agreements relating to the subject matter hereof. I agree and acknowledge that this Agreement may only be amended or modified by written agreement between me and the Company. I agree and acknowledge that Company's waiver of any breach by me of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any other breach I commit of the same or of another provision of this Agreement; no such waiver shall be effective unless agreed to in writing by Company.

### H. Opportunity to Seek Counsel.
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

# EXHIBIT A
## CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION 2870

Section 2870 of the California Labor Code is as follows:

(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:
(1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer's business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or
(2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.

(b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.

## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ASSETS ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

THIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ASSETS ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into effective as of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 2019 (this “Effective Date”), by and between Rupa, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and Tara Lakshana LLC (the "Assignor").

WHEREAS, prior to the Effective Date, the Assignor had obtained certain technology and intellectual property, and has developed or acquired other tangible personal property, as further described below, which relates to the Company's actual and proposed business; and

WHEREAS, the Assignor desires that such technology and intellectual property and other tangible personal property be assigned to and owned by the Company to the extent the Company does not already own the same.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows:

## 1. Certain Definitions.
As used herein, the following capitalized terms will have the meanings set forth below:

(a) “Assigned Assets” means the Business Assets and any Intellectual Property Rights arising from or related to the Business Assets.

(b) “Business Assets” means, collectively, the (i) initial Company branding and designs created by Ronik Design, (ii) Company-based prototypes created by RugerTek, and (iii) research for or related to the Company, including any and all derivatives and embodiments arising from the foregoing.

## 2. Assignment.

(a) In exchange for the payment by the Company of one hundred dollars ($100.00) herewith the execution of this Agreement, along with other good and valuable consideration, the Assignor hereby sells, transfers, assigns and conveys, to the Company, and its successors and assigns, the Assignor's entire right, title and interest in and to the Assigned Assets and all rights of action, power and benefit belonging to or accruing from the Assigned Assets; including the right to undertake proceedings, to recover past and future damages, and to claim all other relief in respect of any acts of infringement thereof whether such acts shall have been committed before or after the date of this assignment, the same to be held and enjoyed by said Company, for its own use and benefit and the use and benefit of its successors, legal representatives and assigns, as fully and entirely as the same would have been held and enjoyed by the Assignor, had this assignment not been made.

(b) The Assignor hereby appoints the Company as the attorney-in-fact of the Assignor, with full power of substitution on behalf of the Assignor to demand and receive any of the Assigned Assets and to give receipts and releases for the same, to institute and prosecute in the name of the Assignor, but for the benefit of the Company, any legal or equitable proceedings the Company deems proper in order to enforce any rights in the Assigned Assets and to defend or compromise any legal or equitable proceedings relating to the Assigned Assets as the Company shall deem advisable. The Assignor hereby declares that the appointment made and powers granted hereby are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable by the Assignor.

(c) The Assignor hereby agrees that the Assignor and the Assignor's successors and assigns will do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or will cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered such further acts, documents, or instruments confirming the conveyance of any of the Assigned Assets to the Company as the Company shall reasonably deem necessary, provided that the Company shall provide all necessary documentation to the Assignor.

## 3. Assignor Representations and Warranties.
The Assignor represents and warrants to the Company that the Assignor is the owner, inventor and/or author of, and can grant exclusive right, title and interest in and to, each of the Assigned Assets transferred by the Assignor hereunder and that none of the Assigned Assets are subject to any dispute, claim, prior license or other agreement, assignment, lien or rights of any third party, or any other rights that might interfere with the Company's use, or exercise of ownership of, any of the Assigned Assets. The Assignor further represents and warrants to the Company that the Assigned Assets are free of any claim of any prior employer or third-party client of the Assignor or any school, university or other institution the Assignor attended, and that there are no claims by any third party to any rights of any kind in or to any of the Assigned Assets. The Assignor agrees to immediately notify the Company upon becoming aware of any such claims.

## 4. Miscellaneous.

### (a) Governing Law.
The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.

### (c) Amendments and Waivers.
No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the parties to this Agreement.

### (d) Successors and Assigns.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives. The Company may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement. No other party to this Agreement may assign, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Company.

### (e) Notices.
Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such party's address as set forth on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice, or if no address is specified on the signature page, at the most recent address set forth in the Company's books and records.

### (f) Severability.
If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable law, the parties agree to renegotiate such provision in good faith. In the event that the parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision, then (i) such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement, (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were so excluded and (iii) the balance of the Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

### (g) Construction.
This Agreement is the result of negotiations between and has been reviewed by each of the parties hereto and their respective counsel, if any; accordingly, this Agreement shall be deemed to be the product of all of the parties hereto, and no ambiguity shall be construed in favor of or against any one of the parties hereto.

### (h) Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
