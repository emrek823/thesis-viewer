### Financing Discussion - Series A Round Progress

- $5.2M closing before EOY with clear visibility into $14M for next year
	- Some already in contracting phase
- Signal Fire offered best terms at $120M valuation but caused operational issues
	- Rookie moves: calling customers directly, pressuring team on term sheet
	- Tried to align with GV which spooked GV - created unnecessary friction
	- Chris Farmer wanted board involvement but couldn’t accommodate without leading
- Bessemer showed interest in co-leading with good GV and McKesson relationships
	- Minimum $8M check requirement with McKesson unwilling to go below $12M
	- No room for additional partners at those levels
	- Requested lower valuation plus other terms - declined
- GV experiencing internal changes
	- Anthony (primary partner) incubating startup to become CEO
	- Board seat assignment unclear - Crystal lacks pharma/biotech expertise
	- May consider board observer seat instead
- Current strategy: two-close structure
	- First close: $15M with McKesson leading
	- Second close (next 60 days): targeting Polaris, Norwest, or F Prime
	- Virtue VC committing $300K in first close

### Product Development and Customer Traction

- Platform expansion with new modules
	- Competitive intelligence: customers actively onboarding
	- China market landscape: Vertex, Atellus, CSL requesting activation
	- Full deal flow visibility through different stages (launching January)
- Sales cycle dramatically improved to 3-4 meetings to contracting
	- Started McKesson diligence early October, added Eli Lilly and Takeda already in contracting
	- Scientific Advisory Board driving acceleration - Takeda BD&M&A head placed by SAB member
	- Customer validation of investor names (McKesson) boosting confidence
- Pipeline metrics
	- $22M total pipeline for next year from current inbound
	- 90% conversion rate for pharma/biotech, 50% for VCs
	- GSK converted as outbound prospect
