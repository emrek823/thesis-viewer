Early interviews with 7 market participants highlight Mural as a strong challenger in a growing space with potential to markedly improve patient satisfaction and retention outcomes

**Why we are excited by Mural Health:**
*   **Absence of modern offerings in clinical trial participant engagement:** Incumbents like Greenphire and Clincierge are viewed as largely legacy, with inflexible and complex software to implement and use.
*   **Strong market tailwinds:** Increased competition for participants, higher stakes to retain patients, and entry of mid-sized pharma / biotech have pushed stakeholders in clinical trials to prioritize patient engagement and satisfaction.
*   **The evolving clinical trial landscape creates new customer demands:** Growing therapeutic and resulting trial complexity drives higher volumes of patient needs and engagements, with more responsibility falling to the increasingly distributed trial sites
*   **Mural Health offers a next-gen product:** Mural differentiates itself by providing digital payments, seamless integrations to rideshare apps, and patient-to-site communication on a single, intuitive platform.
*   **Mural Health's team is best-in-class with a unique perspective on the market:** Deeply experienced founding team from the clinical trial space, leveraging a wealth of learnings from Greenphire experiences.

**Insight is an experienced software investor, with a proven track record of supporting high growth companies as they scale up.**
*   Insight closed Fund XII ($20B), its largest fund to date, to continue to support high growth investments worldwide.
*   Insight has significant experience in clinical trial management and analytics platforms through investments such as Medidata, Florence Healthcare, and TrialJectory.
*   Insight has supported many companies at a similar stage to Mural Health on a path to scale, with deep experience providing ongoing support from the earliest stages, through IPO, and beyond
*   Dedicated team of experienced software operators within the Onsite group and Centers of Excellence for support and partnership along the growth journey.
*   There are several key growth and development opportunities for Mural Health that we believe Insight could uniquely support (slide 6).

**Pharma / Sponsor perspective**
Pharmas run clinical trials in parallel, in many cases outsourcing to CROs or running trials via internal teams

**Each stakeholder group plays a role in clinical SW procurement...**

| Stakeholder | Overview                                  | Role in procurement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 Sponsor** | Pharma / biotech bankrolling the clinical trial | *   Typically engage in vendor evaluation software for central software managed within the Sponsor (e.g., CTMS, EDC) <br/> *   Will generally defer to sites on which site-level solutions they prefer to use (e.g., eISF, eConsent, site payments, etc.)                                                                                                   |
| **2 CRO**     | Research services org hired by sponsor to operate trial in some cases           | *   Recommend specific software packages to Sponsor clients <br/> *   Sometimes try to upsell own software / tech-enabled services to Sponsor, but defer to the Sponsor's / Sites' preferences (see above / below)                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **3 Site**    | Paid by sponsor to recruit patients, administer treatments, and track results | *   Typically control which site-level SW they use, regardless of which eReg vendor the sponsor is procuring centrally, generally bill back SW costs to Sponsor <br/> *   The influence of sites is increasing                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **4 Patients** | Participate in trials at sites                | *   Not formally part of procurement process, but are key end-users of patient-facing clinical SW <br/> *   Patient satisfaction increasingly important consideration for all stakeholders                                                                                                                                                   |

Pharmas and biotechs are ramping their R&D spend; the market is seeing rapid entry of new players and more complex therapeutics

Experts indicate that improving patient and site experience is a high priority in the space

*   "All of big pharma cares a ton about the patient experience – it's a big focus of their time and attention now. There are few ways to do it, and one is paying people on time in a very seamless way."
*   "It's all about bringing ease to the patient, getting them reimbursed in a timely manner, making sure it's super simple. The evolution of convenience for the patient is where this space has to go."
*   "We want sites to use this so patients can upfront get payments right away. We are trying to experiment with different vendors where hopefully, the process is simpler and much easier for the site and participants."

*   Increasing pharma R&D spend and new market entry drive the volume of drugs advancing to the clinical trial stage and competition for participants
*   Startup biotechs – which are generally less well-suited for large enterprise platforms like Veeva / Medidata, are more price-sensitive, and value streamlined offerings – make up the bulk of new entry
*   Patient recruitment / retention is also harder in complex therapeutic areas, making patient experience and site effectiveness critical value levers for sponsors and CROs

| **Strategic focus**     | Patient payment and travel coordination are core areas of focus          | Patient payment is natural expansion but greater focus on core clinical software offerings | Motivated to provide all-in-one service, but not necessary to build patient payments in-house          |

**Company:** medidata
*Series B in 2004, IPO 2009*

**Sales approach:**
*   **Top-down GTM primarily targeting pharma / CROs with broader e-regulatory platform**
    *   Large, recurring contracts
    *   Perceived as only going after largest sites

**Pros & Cons:**
*   **Pros:**
    *   Upsell of more comprehensive e-regulatory platform
    *   More predictable recurring revenue base with enterprise contracts
    *   Faster implementation of point solutions due to OTS integration with core products
*   **Cons:**
    *   Expensive / lengthy sales cycle and implementations
    *   Lack of pricing / product flexibility to target long tail of mid- and downmarket sites

---

**Company:** Florence Healthcare
*Series C in 2021*

**Sales approach:**
*   **Bottoms-up site-first approach**
    *   Two-sided variable pricing model where both sponsors and sites pay on a per-trial basis
    *   Agnostic of site size
    *   Also collaborate with academic medical centers (AMCs) to support investigator-initiated (i.e., 'sponsorless') trials, which receive inbound demand from sponsors looking to incorporate real-world evidence into trials and potentially source new sponsored trials

**Pros & Cons:**
*   **Pros:**
    *   Shorter direct sales cycles (est. ~50 new sites / year)
    *   Flexibility to serve academic medical centers on site-initiated trials (i.e., no sponsor) and maintain contract as AMCs get inbound demand from sponsors to escalate to sponsored trials
    *   PLG flywheel as sponsors recognize value of solution and push out to site networks (est. ~200 new sites / year)
    *   Able to sell to mid / small sites and scale ACV as they scale and add more trials
*   **Cons:**
    *   Difficulty building larger-scale enterprise relationships among pharma to upsell future offerings

Insight's understanding of the complexity behind clinical trial software sales can support Mural in formulating and executing an effective go-to-market approach
