### Business Development Pipeline

- Pharma partnerships
	- Sanofi meeting in 2 weeks - critical timing
		- Target: $500K-$1M commitment by end of year
		- Potential deal size: $3-$8M total
	- BMS showing strong interest in PTRS leveraging foundation models
		- Internal vendor discussions underway
		- Collateral under leadership review for biostats and trial design
		- Rejected Tempus ($10M price point too high) due to cash constraints
	- AZ relationship warming significantly
		- Invited to give stakeholder talks
		- Collaborating on paper using internal data
		- Supporting Tempus foundation model initiatives within AZ
		- Note: Tempus/Pathos organizational confusion - unclear leadership structure
- Health system partnerships
	- Active projects: MD Anderson (3 projects), UCSD, Yale
	- Slower progress: Cedars-Sinai (committed to nference), Kaiser
	- International: UKBB partnership

### Financing Strategy

- Funding round details
	- Target: $20M raise starting January
	- Strategic data purchase commitment for imaging models
	- Story positioning: Moving from adjacent applications to core focus
	- Differentiation from Convoke (more agentic AI approach)
	- Note: Arc Institute comparison (non-profit status difference)
- Revenue validation requirements
	- Need $1M+ contracts for credibility with pharma
	- Press release strategy: 2 logos minimum (Sanofi/AZ target)
	- Pharma judges companies by contract scale
	- Real dollars from Sanofi would significantly strengthen position

### Data and Technology Development

- Medical imaging foundation model
	- SOTA model target: $1M investment
	- Focus areas: Tissue level H&E, pathology space, whole organ, longitudinal analysis
	- Competitive landscape: HOPPR (61 people, minimal output), Radium
	- Market gap: Existing models trained on limited data
- Data licensing
	- Gradient partnership: 2-year licensing commitment
	- Alternative to building imaging models from scratch
	- Cost-effective approach compared to competitors

### Market Positioning

- Competitive advantages
	- Tempus pricing creates market opportunity
	- Cash-strapped pharma companies seeking alternatives
	- Foundation model expertise with health system validation
	- AMC (Academic Medical Center) relationships as proof points
