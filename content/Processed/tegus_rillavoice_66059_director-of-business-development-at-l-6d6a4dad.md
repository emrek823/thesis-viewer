# tegus RillaVoice - Director of Business Development at Long Home Products

**Interview conducted on August 03, 2023**

**Topics**
Rilla, Home Service Sector, Lead Generation, Sales Process, Sales Training, Sales Software Tools, Competition

**Summary**
Long Home Products, a family-owned home improvement company, uses Rilla as a coaching tool for their sales process. The company generates leads through aggregators and traditional marketing sources, and the leads go through a funnel process in the call center to convert them into appointments with salespeople. The Director of Business Development explains that the challenge lies in getting people to adopt Rilla as a helpful tool rather than a punishment. Some sales managers resist using Rilla because it requires more work and is different from what they're used to. The Director mentions that Rilla is a stand-alone software and not integrated with Salesforce, which is the backbone of their company. They discuss the usage reports generated by Rilla and its analytics capabilities, as well as the ability to listen to live phone calls. The Director mentions that Rilla doesn't have any competitors in the space and that their product is being adopted widely with high retention. They mention that Rilla is the only player in the space and that people in the industry are aware of the product. The Director rates their satisfaction with Rilla as a seven out of ten.

**Expert Details**
Director of Business Development at Long Home Products, a customer of RillaVoice.

Director of Business Development at Long Home Products. Reporting to the Chief Operating Officer, the expert is responsible for vendor procurement and the evaluation of technology. The expert primarily focuses on recruiting and real estate for the company. The expert can speak to sales enablement and outreach tools as well as real estate technology.

**Q:** Can you speak to your decision-making when adopting companies such as Rilla?
**A:** Yes, coming up on 1-year renewal, the proposal is in front of us right now to expand our user count. We are looking at the ROI as we speak for the renewal.

**Tegus Client**
Thanks for talking about the home service space. We're looking to get a bit smarter on Rilla. I understand that you're a current customer. So we just have some questions we'll run through to better understand your experience with the product, how you're using it, et cetera. But maybe to start, could you just tell us a little bit about your background, your current role at your company and what your company does?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
So I am the business development director. Our company is a fourth-generation, family-owned home improvement company. So we sell roof, windows, bath and doors across 10 states. We're in the home service sector. And we're a lead generation company.

So we go out and buy leads or generate leads through traditional marketing sources like Facebook and Google, or media. And then we have a call center that sets up the lead and then the salesperson goes out, and then we have to close the lead inside the person's home. And yes, we're using Rilla as a coaching tool for that.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. So your customers are residential homeowner?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Well, doesn't have to be residential. It could be a condo, anybody that owns something that has either a bathroom or a roof or windows that need to be replaced.

**Tegus Client**
And then typically, what's the average cost of a project or something, how much does an average customer pay you?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
The industry usually uses between $15,000 and $20,000 as an average ticket, is what they've determined.

**Tegus Client**
Could you say a little bit more about the sales process, what you were just sharing before? Most of your top of funnel comes from digital advertising. Is that right? Or could you just walk us through how the sales process works? And then if you hire a new sales person what do they actually do on day one?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
There's an industry term called a one-call close, which means the conversation inside the home needs to be sold in one visit. If it's not, we don't call them again or go back. So usually, a visit's two hours. And there's a 10-step selling program that's scripted, and then they'll use the script to get a customer to feel that it's not a pressure sale and feel at ease to buy a product through a set of steps.

It's pretty proven that if you follow the 10-step selling program, you have about a 40% to 50% chance of getting someone to buy something the first time you meet them. So you can start to see why Rilla is important.

**Tegus Client**
You said it's proven that if you follow the 10-step program, did you provide a specific percentage?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Yes. Like 40% probably chance that you're going to sell it. But that's really good. People are trying to get like 30%.

**Tegus Client**
And could you just describe where are you getting all your most top of funnel leads from? And then how do you gradually filter that down?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
So leads are purchased through either aggregators. Those are, call it, like an Angie's List is a good analogy. There's a lot of other ones in the space that you wouldn't even know if I said they were called blue grasshopper, would it make a difference to you.

There's a lot of companies in our space that sell third-party leads that are creating forms all over the Internet for people to fill out. And then after those forms are filled, we call them within the hour to get an appointment on the calendar for ideally the next day. Now some leads come from TV, print, radio, all sorts of things.

**Tegus Client**
And then, say, you have 100 leads from these aggregators in social media. What do you do with them?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
There's a funnel. The funnel starts in the call center. So the call center agent has to take what we call a raw lead and turn it into an issued lead. So they take a raw lead that was given to us, and they try to call that homeowner a certain number of times that you're legally allowed to call them.

And then you're trying to convert that call into a set appointment where the homeowner confirms they're free on that date and time to have be visited by a salesperson. So there's an attrition rate there and there's an attrition rate in the home, a percentage of closing, and then there's an attrition rate on retention of whether or not they cancel after the call or get rejected by finance. So that's what a funnel looks like in our world.

**Tegus Client**
So the touch points are you start with a cold lead, then there's a phone call, then there's an in-person visit, and then hopefully, the deal is closed after that one visit. And then presumably, you come back and actually do the repair, or whatever.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Well, it's not a repair. It's a replacement. We replace a roof, replace a window, replace a bath, replace a door, replace siding. Our company doesn't do repairs, other companies do.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then how big is your sales team?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
We have about 120 people.

**Tegus Client**
Like regionally or all across the U.S.?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
In our markets, we're in 10 states.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And when a new salesperson starts at your company, what do you do with them? How do you train them? And how do they kind of get up and ramp?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
There's a three-week training program where they're in a classroom, and they have to pass a test to prove that they understand the selling system. And if they do that, then they graduate to the field.

And then there's a system to help them stay afloat, like they go out with their managers, part of it's listening to Rilla calls. They have to fit in on different seminars. But most of it's like the three weeks and then we let them loose and then grill them in if they're not closing a certain percentage.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And you said 125 people?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
And does that include managers and sales reps?

Page 3 of 13

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
How many field sales reps would you say there are?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Maybe 100.

**Tegus Client**
Have you ever sold software, digital stuff before?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
I have. I sold software for 10 years and I've managed a team of people that sold software.

**Tegus Client**
Great. Could you just explain what makes field sales different, easier, harder versus software sales? And you probably heard of Gong and Qualified. There's a whole bunch of software sales tools specifically. Do they apply?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
You're saying two different things. Gong is a very similar product in the software space that Rilla is into the service space. So that's a different analogy. But Gong as a software versus selling inside the home are two different things. Software sales is more cultivating a relationship over time, finding a need, building a story, creating a solution, showing the customer a software. And finding the champion, the influencer, the decision-maker.

In our business, everything is done within two hours because the homeowner is the decision maker. And we're trying to find a pain point and a story and a solution all inside the home via an iPad and the 10 steps that we go through.

So no one's prospecting. A salesperson is more just like a person who's giving a commercial through a 10-step selling program, where a software salesperson is trying to develop the relationship, manage the account, onboard the account, figure out who the decision makers are. That could take a month.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. What was your process before Rilla and what was the reason you tried it out?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
So before Rilla, the form of Rilla was done through ride-alongs and managers. And the managers would go out with the sales reps and physically be inside the home with them to provide coaching and feedback. Now the managers can sit back and listen on calls during weekly one-on-ones, or and have the sales reps who have licenses log on and listen and comment to other people's calls to get coaching.

So we have a program called Rilla 90, where within the first 90 days of somebody being onboarded onto long, they will have a license. And we will have them use it as a tool to gain more experience and knowledge and hearing good calls and bad calls and be able to get critiqued by their managers.

**Tegus Client**
How did you first hear about Rilla and what made you interested?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Rilla was at a conference that we attended, like one of those trade shows where vendors set a booth. They

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
were different than anything that we had seen before at conferences, and we're very intrigued. And they let us pilot the software at a low barrier of entry without a contract. So again, we've never seen technology like this in our space.

If you're in software sales, you know about this kind of stuff. But most people aren't coming from software sales in the space. I am. So I immediately said, hey, look, this is just like Gong. It's worth exploring. And with the low barrier of entry, we saw no reason not to give it a try. Plus the CEO, is pretty cool.

**Tegus Client**
And how long ago was this when you first came across Rilla and started using it?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
We're coming up just about on a year.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then just to be clear, before you were using Rilla, you would have a manager go out, actually go to the house with a sales rep and then provide feedback, right?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
It's not like before Rilla. This is how it's been done for 60 years. That's the only way a manager could see how their rep does who go in the home with them.

**Tegus Client**
And then what was the exact workflow? Does Rilla impact the frequency at which the manager is able to give feedback? Like before, you physically go and then what is a typical workflow?

Do they deliver the feedback on the spot right after the house visit? Or you mentioned like weekly one-on-ones with Rilla now. So how is that workflow different versus now that you're using Rilla?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
I think what I'm hearing is, has the technology give the manager an ability to provide more coaching or listen to more calls or virtually ride along? Of course, I mean, if the manager doesn't have to drive their car to someone's house and can listen to calls at the end of the day, absolutely, they can get more feedback from the comfort of their desk. And that's one of the big selling points of Rilla.

**Tegus Client**
I guess with Rilla now, is there a certain structure to which feedback is delivered at your firm? Is there a more formalized system or cadence? Or is it still more ad hoc like, hey, when the manager has time, I'll look through x, y, z sales rep through Rilla and then deliver feedback ad hoc. What does that system look like?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
The biggest challenge is how do we get the software adopted and not be seen as a punishment. Like, oh, Rilla is a punishment. We have to listen to your calls versus this is a tool to help you. And that's been a challenge. We have to get people that want to use the tool and we have to get people to learn.

But there is correlation with people who use the tool are doing better. It's clear. So that has been in our favor. Otherwise, you wouldn't even consider renewing. But like I said, ideally, a new rep coming in has to listen to a certain number of calls in their first 90 days. Now one of the thoughts we had was tying bonus compensation to Rilla usage for managers and that's something we're looking at going into next year.

**Tegus Client**
It feels like it makes sales managers life so much easier. Why are some sales managers not using Rilla?

Page 5 of 13

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Because it's more work and it's different and it's not the same as they're used to doing. And these are like blue-collared people.

**Tegus Client**
I don't understand the more work, though. Like if you have to drive to less houses, why is that more work?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Because the ride-along is like you got to go out into the field. That's work also. But they're not going to not do ride-alongs because we have Rilla. It's like they're going to do ride-alongs and Rilla.

**Tegus Client**
My interpretation before this response was that I think they no longer had to go on all of these ride-alongs.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Absolutely not. It's in addition.

**Tegus Client**
And then I guess in terms of your internal tech stack that you're using, can you walk us through what different tools or solutions Rilla's integrated with or connected to in your day-to-day workflow, if at all? And in terms of your core workflow of managing these field calls or meetings, notes, are you using anything in conjunction with Rilla? Or is it just primarily Rilla, like end-to-end?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
What do you mean? Like Rilla has a user interface that has analytics to show aggregate reports of our usage by wrapper, people that close versus don't close, or by team. But when you say other products in conjunction.

**Tegus Client**
Do you have a CRM, for example?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
We do have Salesforce, but it's not integrated with Salesforce.

**Tegus Client**
We'd like to understand like you have a CRM, you might have a prospecting tool, just what other tools you're using in the sales team.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
We have a measurement tool where you can take pictures of houses and it gives you a measurement of the size of the roof. We have a pricing tool that gives the salesperson a price in the home so they don't have to figure it out in a spreadsheet, automatic, it plugs in the measurement and then it gives you a price. Those are the two main tools.

There's a popular product called CompanyCam right now. So there's a lot of tools like that. There's marketing softwares we use to help organize the leads. If you go to any home service conference, you'll see the same vendors at every single place.

**Tegus Client**
Would you call the source of truth for your data? I guess for Salesforce, but all your notes, all of the conversations from these customers, well, first of all, do they matter? Do you need them a year from now? And two, where are they all actually stored? We're trying to understand which tools are really kind of the

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
backbone of your company.

Salesforce 1,000% is the backbone of our company. I mean, we're buying more Salesforce left and right. We cannot stop investing in them and third-party developers. It's the only way for us to grow our business. Rilla is not like that at all. It's a stand-alone software, there's no API, it doesn't integrate with it. And we use it as a coaching tool and those conversations stay in their platform and that's it.

**Tegus Client**
That's helpful to know. And I would have guessed that like you, whatever, you're talking to John Smith, a customer, whoever records that conversation. And then that would get fed into like the John Smith entry into CRM. That seems to me that would be helpful for you too. But does that not matter?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
I guess it could be helpful historically, but we're not doing that. I think what you just brought up is a really good point, could we store that data piece inside of our Salesforce system to keep in the future, I guess, if there's a lawsuit or something. But we're not doing that.

**Tegus Client**
And is that because we're generally just going to a customer and you're going to a customer once, like if they say yes, great. If they said no, you're not retargeting.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Right. We're not going to talk to them again. We might try to upsell them a year later, but that's kind of it.

**Tegus Client**
From your earlier response, it sounds like maybe some friction in terms of getting adoption. Is that more so on the manager side or also on actual sales? Like anecdotally, just feedback, like on how sales rep, managers have responded to Rilla as a product would be helpful.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Look, any time you bring in something new to old people, it's always going to be resistance. But as new people get hired, they don't know the difference anyway. So they're just going to like listen to whatever you say because they're going to think it's like a company standard.

So we have reports every Thursday that come out by the person who handles the Rilla account and he's showing some markets, that used it in some markets that don't. But because it's not connected or mandated to anything, there's not really much we can do to manage it.

**Tegus Client**
Do you mind elaborating on the last point? You're saying you have reports every Thursday generated by Rilla that shows usage.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
There's somebody in our company who actually builds our spreadsheet and just shows how many teams have left comments on call. Like we're trying to set a goal to show adoption and usage. It's really a usage thing.

Because we have to divide it by our teams, Rilla is just dividing it by people. Rilla invests all their text in like the ChatGPT token for AI reader to have better ability to capture voice. They're not doing much on the analytics dashboard on the desktop.

**Tegus Client**

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
That was going to be one of my follow-up questions, they do have analytics function in app versus the platform, whatever you want to call it. How advanced is that? Who use that? What do you use that for?

It's pretty amateur. If I'm being honest. I mean, it's fine. The real text and the ability to have it regurgitate information and then play it against the script and get percentages and monuments where you hit certain parts of our 10-step selling program.

It's basically trying to match it off of, did they do what they're supposed to do based on what our selling program is. So you can say, okay, they hit step two, they hit step four, they missed step three. Or people who are in the home for more than three hours have a better chance of selling than people in the phone in the room for less than two hours. So you can make inferences. It's just data.

**Tegus Client**
And that's customized to your sales process, right?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Correct.

**Tegus Client**
If I were a different company and I have a six-step sales process, could I customize that in Rilla?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Correct. It's just like open, like you program it, how you see fit.

**Tegus Client**
And what other analytics do they actually show you today?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Just like talk time. You can go into each individual call and look at did the person say this particular sentence that we know is a good thing to say at certain points in the call, stuff like that.

**Tegus Client**
Do you read Rilla transcripts like yourself?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
I have read some.

**Tegus Client**
How do you use it? Do you read the entire transcript or does Rilla highlights certain parts that you should immediately look at?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Both. You can pull out highlights, it gives you a summary or you can read through the individual transcript itself.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. what level of automation is there? Like, for example, if I could give you a human scribe that goes with you to every single sales meeting and just literally just hand writes 100% of the entire conversation and gives you that. That would be the same output as Rilla, right? Like it's just a transcript of the call. But how much more does Rilla do on top of that? Is it a lot today?

Page 8 of 13

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
It does. I mean, first of all, live phone call is way better than a written transcript. It's like reading a book versus seeing a movie or an audio book, I guess. But I would not want a transcript. You want to be able to fast forward and backwards through a call, that's a way better value, in my opinion, than reading a transcript. No manager is going to sit there and read a two-hour novel.

**Tegus Client**
I gave the wrong example. Like if I just brought along a recorder in my pocket to every single sales meeting, I just recorded it. Does Rilla really do anything pull out on top of that?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Yes. I don't think that's a fair comparison. I think Rilla does a lot more than that. I think they aggregate the data and proves that the person follows the script or didn't follow the script. That's the big selling piece because it's a script-based selling program.

**Tegus Client**
That's helpful because as you know, a lot of these AI tools, they are just doing what basic level stuff like text to speech transcription and it just seems like anyone could do that. But it seems like there's something on top that does that's helpful for you.

On that note, I guess what we are trying to get at is the defensibility of Rilla's product. If you could speak to that, like in your own words, in what ways do you think the product does differentiated, defensible? And if not, that's fine too, just it would be helpful to get your thoughts there.

In terms of do they have a superior attack that is really hard to replicate from a competitor? And I know from your perspective, that might be hard to answer, but from you as a customer, user of the product, is there anything about the tech, the user interface or maybe it's the team?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
I might be underselling the product, but they don't have any competitors in the space. I mean, they're raising their prices on a lot of people. Their product is getting adopted all across the space and I believe they have a pretty high retention.

So we're not going to cancel them. The only way we would cancel is if our people stop using a product. If we can figure out a way to mandate it, I don't think we're going to get it cancel from Rilla. So I mean it gives our people ability to be at many places without having to physically be there. I mean that's pretty valuable. And for us to be able to say you're not using the script correctly, I know I keep repeating myself, but it's very powerful stuff.

**Tegus Client**
If Gong or some other sales software tool decided tomorrow, hey, we want to go into field sales, do you think they could do this?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
I do. I don't take the notes that big.

**Tegus Client**
That's what we're trying to get at.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Yes. Or just be more clear then.

**Tegus Client**
So would you become a Gong customer if they came into your place?

Page 9 of 13

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
I mean, right now, Gong, I think, is only software-based like a Zoom call. I mean if they had a product in the field, I think we would consider trying them so long as their tech output was the same as Rilla's and it would easily obtainable. But other than that, we would 100% try them because we'd want to try to find someone as an alternative price.

**Tegus Client**
And on that note, what would you say are your top three and ranked in order of importance? Like your key evaluation criteria and that could be things like pricing, performance, however you want to define performance in the context of this product, ease of use and things like that.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
My top three priorities or my top three things that you think Rilla does?

**Tegus Client**
Top three evaluation criteria, like when we talked about in the context of Rilla versus Gong or something else. What is important to you?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Being able to measure ROI, being able to have easy adoption and clear measurability.

**Tegus Client**
Do you mind elaborating on how point one, on being able to measure ROI and point three, on clear measurability are different? Do you mind explaining what you mean by those points?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Clear ROI is the ability to better dashboards and reporting to be able to have clear differentiating factors. Like right now, their data is very like storytelling. So you'd see like you're looking at these 300 calls, there's a 10% dispersity that people who do this have a better chance of closing because these ones sold and these ones didn't.

And it's like, well, it's good, but it's not like, oh this is amazing. So I think that's where that discrepancy comes in. Because there's the value of keeping the recording of the call in the home, against a script is huge. So then after that, is it a nice to have or is it like a need to have? And I think that's we're constantly challenging Rilla to keep getting better at delivering that to us.

**Tegus Client**
That's helpful. And then on point number two, you're saying being able to have easy adoption. Do you just mean it's like easy to use for your sales reps, your managers?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Yes, I think so. I think if Rilla had automatic reporting, where we didn't have to go in and figure it out ourselves. I think that would be good. It would like share a report weekly with the manager on their team. Right now, it's just like, here's the hodgepodge of licenses, but it doesn't really say this is the ABC's team's reporting. It is something built out.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then your last point, what do you mean by clear measurability?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
I think you're probably right. Probably a spillover into point one.

**Tegus Client**

Page 10 of 13

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
That's helpful. And then you said you had 125 people on your sales team. So they all have a license and access to Rilla?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
They don't all have a license.

**Tegus Client**
How does that work within your team?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
It's difficult. We had to figure out who needs the license and who doesn't and we're trying to see if we're going to expand right now. And everything that you're asking me, how are you going to know if you're going to expand? Well, we're asking them to crunch more on the ROI and make sure we can see the measurability before we get more likelihood.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And as you looked into the next, call it, six, 12 plus months, do you anticipate spend increasing, decreasing? But based on your previous response, it sounds like you're still in the process of figuring that out.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
We have another 60, 90 days into our renewal. My gut tells me is we're not going to cancel at all, and it's a 50-50 chance that we're going to increase the license. I don't think we're going to cancel. I think definitely we'll use them for another year.

I really don't think we're going to cancel. But are we going to get way more licenses? I don't know because it's creeping up to be more expensive than our CRM stuff and our CRM is way more important. And it's like, well, Rilla may be a good tech product and there are all that kind of stuff, but they're not better than Salesforce, if we had to pick one.

**Tegus Client**
Have you given Rilla today to your worst or your best reps?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Mixed. You have to do it mix. Otherwise, you can't benchmark.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. We talked to another customer, they do like solar panel stuff different from you.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Yes, same thing.

**Tegus Client**
And then as we're talking about potential expansion you're considering whether or not to get additional licenses on your team. Do you feel like, let's say, cost aside, you do wish everyone on the team had a license?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Yes, 100%. Cost aside, we wishes everybody had a license. 100% wouldn't even be a question because that's what's on the table right now. That's the renewal on the table to get everybody a license.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Got it. And then so is it fair to say I today, it sounds like you're benchmarking, testing with particular people within your broader sales teams. Are you just in the stage of proving out ROI in order to make that decision on whether or not more people or everyone on your team needs a license?

Like you only have a subset of people within your broader sales team today with licenses on Rilla. So to date, has it been more so for the last year or so. Have you been in the phase of figuring out whether or not there's enough ROI for you to consider additional, like, I know cost probably being the main consideration.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Cost is a huge consideration. And I can tell you, we have a better deal than most people out there.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then how would you explain ROI? Like could you tie it to improved ramp time or higher quota attainment or something?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
We definitely have seen higher close rates because of it.

**Tegus Client**
And then within costs, it sounds like all of your recorded conversations notes of our system more in Rilla say it's not connected to your CRM. But how do you foresee like how difficult it would be or respected would it be, like hypothetically, you have to switch to another vendor, would you be fine with that?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Yes, it's not that sticky. Like we could just cancel tomorrow, and it would be fine.

**Tegus Client**
Your historical call transcripts don't matter as much like you don't care about the transpiration from a year ago. It's all refreshing anyway.

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Yes. I don't think so. I mean the industry has never had it before. So I don't think we would be extremely upset if that would happen.

**Tegus Client**
And then you mentioned a year ago when you first heard about Rilla at the conference like you've never seen tech like this in the industry before. And then you also told later in the call that Rilla don't have any competitors.

And I'm just curious like recent months or times, have you heard of any other emerging names pop up that is doing something similar or competitive? Or is Rilla still the only player in the space to your knowledge?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Rilla is the only one. There's multiple vendors in other sectors, but like automatic dialers and things like that, but not with Rilla. It's a good product. They just have limitations. I mean they're a start-up.

**Tegus Client**
And then I guess what I'm trying to get at here is just general awareness within your industry, it doesn't have to be home services specifically. But speaking to various colleagues in the industry, do you feel like people are aware of Rilla or that a technology like this exists?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
I think if you're a big enough firm, you know Rilla. We all talk. We all like on calls and we all know each

other. Everybody knows about it.

**Tegus Client**
And how do you define like "big enough" firm in your industry?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Probably $10 million plus annual revenues.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then if you have to rate your satisfaction with Rilla on a scale of one to 10, what will that number be?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Seven.

**Tegus Client**
And then just so we have point of comparison thinking about some of the other tools you mentioned, like a Salesforce, what would you rate that?

**Director of Business Development at Long Home Products**
Well, they're awful because they make you do all the development outside of them. Like nothing is out of the box. You have to build everything yourself. But if you invest, it's an amazing product. So I'd probably give them a nine out of 10.

**Tegus Client**
That's very helpful. I really appreciate the time. Enjoy the rest of your day.
