## Summary
The FDA is providing clear guidance on how real-world data can be used to generate real-world evidence for medical device regulatory decisions. This guidance updates and expands previous recommendations, creating a more standardized framework for using real-world data in device approvals.

## Startup Angle
A startup could build a real-world data aggregation and analytics platform specifically designed to meet FDA's new standards for medical device evidence generation. Companies like Real-Time Insights or HealthData Dynamics that create robust, FDA-compliant RWD collection and analysis tools would be well-positioned. Existing startups like Flatiron Health (now part of Roche) that already work in RWD could expand their medical device offerings. Potential beneficiaries include digital health monitoring startups that can now more easily use their collected user data for regulatory submissions.
