### Sutter Health Strategic Direction & AI Initiatives

- Define what to chase after next year - fully loaded trying to close things before year-end
- Epic roadmap uncertainty creating hesitation for new partnerships
	- Existing Abridge contracts shortened from 3 years to 1-2 years due to Epic competition concerns
	- Internal teams giving too much credence to Epic roadmap concerns
- New Chief AI Officer setting plans and strategies
- Looking for horizontal platforms across clinical and admin workflows
	- Want to avoid overlap with existing Abridge and ADOC (imaging) partnerships
	- Home health identified as white space opportunity
	- Interest in nursing-oriented AI copilots

### Current AI/Digital Health Landscape Assessment

- Abridge vs Ambience competitive dynamics
	- Ambience wins 97% of bake-offs when included
	- Abridge loses primarily due to brand recognition advantages
	- Dragon (Epic’s solution) creating pricing pressure across space
- 60,000 person organization challenges
	- Unlike lean investment teams, requires internal back-channeling before pursuing new partnerships
	- Leadership wants to move quicker and leverage SF/Silicon Valley position
	- Overwhelmed by similar-claiming companies, hard to differentiate on demos alone
- Academic medical center partnerships (Mayo) don’t always translate to traditional health systems
- Interest in being early health system customer for proven solutions

### 340B Program Changes & Opportunities

- Starting January 1st: HRSA 340B rebate model pilot
	- Select drugs (Eliquis, Imbruvica, Jardiance) moving from upfront discount to pay-and-rebate model
	- Creates new administrative burden: auditing, claim deduplication, rebate processing
	- 340B critical as major health system profit center
	- Pharmacy leakage and alternative site infusion ongoing challenges
