The World Model of Biology is on the horizon.

We believe the solutions to the world’s toughest diseases exist and are hidden in plain sight – locked in silos and obscured by the noise of biological data.   
  
M-Optimus, built on billions of data points, enables users to mine, interrogate and model experimental outcomes *in silico*, guiding them to new targets, signatures and precision solutions. More than an innovation, M-Optimus is the first step in leading an AI revolution in healthcare, where simple routine bedside tests can drive treatment decisions. Unlocking not only access to potentially lifesaving therapies for patients, but also greater access to qualified patients for clinical trials.

M‑Optimus is trained on a large, proprietary corpus spanning billions of data points, from millions of patients and hundreds of institutions. It unifies routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) slides with multi‑omics profiles, in both spatially and non-spatially resolved tissues, with longitudinal clinical outcomes.

For clinical development, this breadth and diversity matter: they help the model learn stable, cross‑scale biology, without introducing trial or cohort‑specific artifacts.  

For researchers, M-Optimus allows you to quickly develop AI embeddings of your specific patients of interest and to refine and tune the model for more complete insights.  

For target hunters, LLM or AI agents can be deployed to "deep mine" the composite model for novel insights, new targets and for the development of data-driven combination strategies.

M-Optimus shifts the paradigm from hypothesis-driven high-risk investments to data driven high-confidence decision making.  M-Optimus will deliver the power to de-risk pipelines, accelerate time-to-market, and may unlock new markets with new therapeutic indications. Opening possibilities to repurpose failed drugs, identify new candidate patients and accelerate timelines across the drug development timeline, generating savings and revenue potential in the billions.

### Built to facilitate novel insights and better decision‑making

M-Optimus is the ultimate backbone for encoding and decoding biology. It leverages a cutting-edge neural network architecture that maps different data modalities into a unified representation.  
The M-Optimus backbone thus acts as a powerful foundation for specialized prediction models in a plug-and-play fashion. This allows teams to reuse and repurpose M-Optimus for different tasks, typically with few available samples, without the need to train their own models from scratch.

### Built by the team behindbenchmark‑leading pathology models.

Trusted by almost 1 Million professionals

M‑Optimus is developed by a team of veterans from frontier AI and biology labs that created the [H‑Optimus histopathology foundation models](https://www.bioptimus.com/h-optimus-1), with nearly 1 Million downloads and consistent state‑of‑the‑art results in global benchmarks. The same scientific rigor and validation practices are present in M‑Optimus. For clinical leaders, this translates into a platform you can evaluate with the same standards you use for any critical decision‑support technology, rather than experimental models that are hard to trust at scale.

“M-Optimus has the incredible potential to democratize treatment decisions for patients worldwide, by using inexpensive routine tests like H&E biopsies to gain complex molecular and phenotypic information, stratifying patients at the bedside, predicting their actionable biomarkers, and enabling physicians to make treatment decisions regarding which patients to give targeted therapies, and which patients to send home without aggressive treatments.  
  
Building upon the capabilities of H-Optimus-1, the potential predictive power of M-Optimus is very exciting indeed.”
