## Summary
The Tegus Client engaged in a detailed discussion with an expert from Elevance Health regarding the prior authorization processes of senior decision-makers at large payors. The conversation covered the challenges faced, including incomplete data and the need for automation, as well as the role of various EMRs and vendors like Epic, Allscripts, Waystar, and Anterior AI in supporting the process. Additionally, the expert highlighted the capabilities of companies like Anterior AI, Change Healthcare, Cohere Health, and Apixio in automation, interoperability, care collaboration, and AI utilization for risk adjustment. The importance of reducing manual processes and making informed decisions in complex medical cases was also emphasized, along with the impact of risk adjustment on health scores and pricing policies in the healthcare industry.

## Expert Details
Senior Director - Product, GTM, and Growth Strategy at Elevance Health Inc. The expert is responsible for leading end-to-end monetization strategy including product pricing and financial analyses for Digital Product Marketplace and Digital Health Products Platform targeting multiple customer segments and generating multiple revenue streams over the next five years.

Prior to Elevance Health, the expert was Senior Manager - Product, GTM, and Growth Strategy at CVS Health Corp, leaving December 2021. The expert was responsible for leading end-to-end product strategy for the launch and commercialization of transformative health products across PBM, market impacting millions of members across 10,000+ stores across 50 US states in a multi-million dollar opportunity.

## Client
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about how senior decision-makers at large payors approach and manage prior authorization processes, especially across multiple plans. I saw your background and I thought you'd be a great fit. If you don't mind, could you maybe start by walking me through your background and your current role at Elevance?

## Expert
Thanks for the opportunity. Spent the last number of years building products and commercializing products across health plans and PBMs and retail pharmacies. In my current role at Elevance Health, I oversee a whole slew of product solutions, including both member centric solutions and product provider centric solutions. These include things like prior authorization, payment integrity, risk adjustment, on the payer provider side. On the member side, behavioral health, condition management and disease specific management like diabetes, cardiac, heart health.

I also do a bunch of commercialization around different alternative health that are in the market. My role is pretty diverse and pretty widespread, my tentacles everywhere. It's definitely a strategic role. I come across a ton of either new third-party vendor solutions or partner solutions that are across the market or across different capabilities I just outlined for both member- and payer-provider-focused products. Happy to talk to you about the PA landscape today and the different vendors.

## Client
Thanks so much. That background is really useful. To confirm, do you work across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial? I know Elevance offers several plans.

## Expert
That is a great question. It's only commercial. My current role is commercial.

## Client
Thanks for that background. Maybe we can talk a little bit about how Elevance thinks about prior authorization. I'm curious how prior auth is currently managed across Elevance's different commercial plans.

## Expert
Can you repeat the question from just a broader perspective as opposed to health-specific perspective?

## Client
Yes. Across your experience at, let's say, Elevance and CVS, thinking about a health plan perspective, how have you seen prior authorization be managed?

## Expert
Absolutely. It's a very key component because it allows plans to review and then effectively approve or deny a provider request on a specific clinical process. It involves a very end-to-end, I would say, process then and product connectivity between the payers and providers. It all starts with the provider essentially ordering a specific test or a medical procedure that the health plan presumably needs to cover for a commercial population. The order comes in, there is a request that goes through. Now, on the provider side and the payer side, there's some connectivity platform.

There's Epic, has payer provider platform and there's a bunch of different vendors out there that do that interface management. That's where provider personal request goes through the, I would say, vendor or through the flow that connects the provider to the payer. It goes through that, the payer-provider platform, let's just say. It goes through the platform and then on the payer side or the health plan side, they have prior authorization process enabled pretty early on. Request comes in, at that point, it sets the decision tree around prioritization and the prior authorization vendor, the capability kicks in.

There's EMR integration, once that capability or the prior auth system is activated, there's data extraction, data normalization then happens. Going through that phase, there's prior authorization required or not that decision is made. Yes, in this case, because it is a need for prior auth. Now, that is the system that checks whether the existing authorization is there on the site or not. If yes, then it goes on to approval or denial. If not, then authorization initiation and referral request is initiated.

It is asking, at this point, for a lot of clinical data, which includes member medical history, some additional medical information that health plan would need to make that decision if it's not evident from the claim file and the member data that has been sent out through that payer provider platform from the provider to the payer. Once they have that data, that data is analyzed, processed, intelligently managed and then the authorization decision is made in a yes or no.

A lot of this process is automated and a chunk of it is also manual. That's where the vendors kick in and there's a lot of distinction that happens across the landscape. There's a lot of pain points too that as we unpack this process will find out. That, essentially, is how any health plan, be it Elevance or otherwise, think about it, the prior auth. When to implement it, when to kick it in, when to trigger that prior authorization process and what helps them decide whether it's a yes or no based on what they get from the provider or the need for the member.

## Client
Right. You mentioned there are a lot of pain points. I'd be excited to dig into what are on the top of your head.

## Expert
Yeah. I think some of the biggest pain points are around, first of all, the intake. What's the provider EMR maturity at this point? Believe it or not, there are still a lot of providers that are not on any electronic medical records system and the majority of their paperwork is still on paper. That's a pain point that exists right there at the start of it. If it's just paper that the provider manages and they don't have any EMR, even to this day and age, then they will fax over that request or send it through in a mail format. Now, that's the first pain point. Second pain point is around understanding whether there is a prior auth existing or not.

That process requires a lot of data extraction or normalization. Now, different providers have different EMR systems and that creates different levels of challenge. Different EMRs capture different levels of data. Most of them are very in depth, but maybe some are not. Even when the EMR itself is very in depth, not every provider is very in depth in their documentation.

If a member is at a health system or with a provider group that just has not been in a good practice to write very detailed SOAP notes, the challenge becomes, the entire medical history of that particular member is going to be, I would say, scanty in terms of information that would be required and mandated to make the best decision from a prior authorization perspective. That's the second pain point. The completeness, that requires the systems to do a very thorough, complete scan. That process is time-consuming and can be prone to error. That's the second pain point.

Third pain point is, once you have all of that information, you scan all of that, but then still, did you make the right decision or did you make the wrong decision as far as saying yes or no? You had everything, but you still basically said yes to a procedure that was not medically necessary or clinically required at that particular time. That led to a health plan being responsible to pay for a $6,000 PET scan, which could have been really avoided, because all you needed was an X-ray. Those are some of the biggest pain points that exist in the market that help clients think about tackling as they think about or implement prior auth.

## Client
That's super useful. On that second page point, the completeness of data. Would you mind giving me a couple examples of data used to support a prior authorization branching out from just a patient's history with that condition?

## Expert
Absolutely. A lot of it is around, let's say, the examples of data would be around relevant clinical data. If a member has, let's say, an MRI that is required for them, relevant clinical data would include the entire medical history with the orthopedic and neurology notes, because those are the primary reasons why an MRI would be required. That would be the first and foremost. Within that, how detailed is the data and the charting process? Is that available or not? That would be the first thing when you look at the scanning capability. A lot of this is around paperwork. As I mentioned, there's a lot of providers that are still simply on paper.

There's no electronic medical records. If that's the case, that creates volumes and volumes of paper that needed to be scanned and read. When you scan volumes of paper of medical records and then you try to glean from it, it's a very painful process. It's really, really difficult to do this accurately in a manual fashion. That creates a big need for automation. In order to automate, there's different capabilities that vendors need to have in order to successfully scan that data without any errors. That's what I meant by complete. There's some scanning, documentation beyond just the member data.

## Client
That makes sense. You touched on this just a second ago, but in the first pain point around this large variety of EMRs, sometimes no EMRs, are there some EMRs, like non Epic, that you have found are especially scant in data or quite diverse?

## Expert
Epic is definitely, in my mind, the best EMR from a capability standpoint and thoroughness standpoint and connectivity perspective. That is just, in my mind, the number one. It comes to, are there other EMRs that

are good? There are. The problem becomes they're not a one-stop shop. For example, Allscripts is a good EMR, Cerner, also a good EMR, but essentially, they don't have, I would say, the scheduling capability that Epic has. It's integrated directly into the Epic clinical system. The scheduling system is directly integrated. That capability doesn't exist like Allscripts.

## Client
What was the respective EMRs that you listed, Allscripts and the second one?

## Expert
Cerner. Athena is another one too. I would think that they're actually good as well. There's a bunch of others, including McKesson and all of that.

## Client
Perfect. Considering from a systems and vendor perspective, what systems and vendors have you seen used across your positions to support this PA process?

## Expert
Yeah. There are a bunch of solutions, but there are some that I've closely looked at. I know there's more that exist. I could list out the ones that I have heard of or have come across, but then I can go into the details of some of them that I have looked at even more closely. At a high level, there are different vendors like Waystar, Experian, Change Healthcare, Cohere Health, Rhyme Health.

You have Anterior AI, which is one of the newer one, it's a good one. Cohere we talked about. Apixio and then Change Healthcare, which is the biggest of all. There's these other ones that I think generally have a good market perception and they do come across different health plans' day-to-day work. Essentially, from a capability standpoint, I look closely at Change versus Apixio or Datavant versus Cohere versus Anterior AI.

## Client
That's perfect. Considering those four, Change, Datavant, Cohere and Anterior, I'd be curious to talk about areas of differentiation that you've noticed.

## Expert
Absolutely. Where would you like to start?

## Client
Maybe we can start with the PA process, but also how these different companies differ across the specialties that they work for.

## Expert
Absolutely. Starting at the PA specific capabilities for these, I would say, Anterior AI, I think, is, the biggest use case that that company has is around PA. That particular company, I would say, is mostly around PA. If you look at Anterior AI, the differentiator, essentially there is artificial intelligence. It is essentially leveraging immense amount of AI to streamline the overall and the prior auth process to make it simple, emphasizing the manual interventions that are required to improve prior auth decision making.

In my mind, automation for things like intake process, where we talked about a bunch of paperwork that still goes there, handwritten notes and fax, medical records, those things, to automate a lot of that because that's where the biggest, I think, chunk of time is lost. That is a huge win. It also manages and intakes that process, the data, more digitally and in an automated fashion. I talked about thoroughness of scanning.

Anterior is good about picking up any missing documentation in real time and sending that to the provider. I think, in my mind, that's a big standout because that real-time feedback to the provider on missing data could be an enormous time saver. In my mind, those things are just the value proposition or differentiators for Anterior. It does have some of the case studies I've seen from them. Again, this is not specific to

Elevance, so I'm not commenting on them at all in any way, shape or form, just in general, from some of the data that I've seen on them.

They can increase your approval process or decision process. They can reduce the manual processes by over 70%, 75%. If you reduce the manual operations by 75%, you can ultimately lead to at least double of the time. You can sweeten that time in terms of the decision-making. Instead of four days, you would take two days. Instead of 10 days, you take five days. That, in my mind, is a highlight for Cohere Health. Let me pause here before we switch to the next one.

## Client
This was perfect. Very clear explanation of how it's able to automate reviewing the documentation that's submitted to find errors. My question for you, this, that's perfect for health plans that have an EMR. These health plans that don't have any EMR and are literally faxing you paper, is Anterior also useful for that? How does it approach that input?

## Expert
It does. They have the capability that takes in that manual data. It structures the data the right way. If you have a detail around, let's say, members, family history on one page in one document and then on the second document, that the family history is on page nine, it's going to streamline, create one file for the member. When it streamlines information, it's going to take everything from the first document out of the family history, everything from the second document of the family history.

Even though they are in different pages in the manual format, it takes all of that, it consolidates and combines all of that into one section around, say, a family history. This is just an example, it does the same data cleaning and scanning across the entire patient chart, for all dimensions. That is an example of Anterior AI at work in saving a lot of time on the health plan side to ingest, structure and understand manually written and submitted data.

It also automatically creates a case number. Prior auth is not to be looked at in silo. I gave you an end-to-end process of prior auth earlier, but just remember, the prior auth systems are connected to other systems, like care management, risk adjustment, utilization, all of that. It's connected to that. The system should talk to each other. How the systems would talk to each other, the the first step is to create that ingested data into one file with a case number. It automatically does that also. From there, it can flow on to the next system for that workflow.

## Client
That makes sense. We've covered thoroughly these two pain points around efficiency. A second ago you mentioned this third pain point around actually making the right decision. I'm wondering, is Anterior useful for that?

## Expert
Anterior, to some extent, yes. It does have clinical reasoning capability. It does have capability to intelligently understand those complex medical cases with complicated guidelines. It does have that capability that does that. There are still cases that do require manual intervention and I don't think any vendor does that 100%. I think, from a capability on from that particular aspect, I would say, maybe I'd give you an objective number. I would say like an eight.

## Client
Out of 10?

## Expert
Yeah.

## Client
That makes sense. It sounds like there's some room for growth across all vendors in terms of not requiring

manual intervention.

## Expert
Yep.

## Client
Can you characterize, I'm just curious, what cases are really quite complex and require manual intervention?

## Expert
A bunch of them would be around your, let's say, site of care options or medical tests. Let's say, somebody ordered an MRI. For a health plan to approve or deny an MRI request, it has to be able to understand the data has to show the medical severity or the complexity, the longevity of the case, how long has the patient or the member been suffering from this condition? How complex this is, how many doctors have they seen, what other conservative management have they done? Have they been to a PT, OT? Things like that. Those would be the elements.

An example why I'm saying, of elements that will be looked at, so musculoskeletal would be one. I would say fertility would be another one. That's another big area where prior auth is potentially used. The fertility, like maternal health, things like that, for somebody who needs, ley's say, in vitro and would need surrogacy and things like that that happen. Even for people who have high risk pregnancies, there's a lot of tests that happen.

That'd be another area of high utilization for prior auth. Another case would be, let's say, specialty pharmacy or infusion pharmacy, rather. Somebody has, let's say, end stage kidney disease and they are on some an infusion or a liver transplant and it's a case of infusion post liver transplant, so things like that. Those would be examples. Obviously, cancer, that would be another area for highly position for PA. Does that help?

## Client
That's perfect. These medical tests and fertility, that makes sense. I think I understand Anterior's use cases and also areas for growth. Would you mind giving me a similar synthesis for maybe Change Healthcare or Cohere, wherever you feel like you have the most insight?

## Expert
Yeah. I can talk about both. From a scanning perspective, it does have the capability to scan and ingest intelligently some of that data, I'm talking about Change right now, and make that determination. What I see is, Change, I see a lot behind the scenes, they were going on business rules or clinical policy management. With the AI capability, Anterior, I see a more of a AI usage and not a higher dependency. Everybody has to lean on the medical policy and American rules, there's always going to be dependency on that, for sure. I'm just saying that maybe the level of intelligent automation and AI is, I would say, a bit higher in Anterior, in my humble opinion.

This is my own perspective, so to speak. Change, again, the way, in my mind, it differentiates is, it speaks to pretty much every EMR system. It's able to work with a bunch of different providers because it has connectivity to pretty much most of the EMRs. From an interoperability standpoint, it is pretty good, again, because it's been around for a while, it's an established player. Those would be some of the reasons for that. That would be around Change Health. Cohere, I would say Cohere is more automation than AI. It does have some AI capability. At this point, everybody's saying AI. There's not a vendor that doesn't have AI. Everyone is saying AI.

In my mind, I feel like they are more of an automation company as opposed to an AI company. A lot of their strength is around automating the intake process, automating their review process on queue management and generating that letter and automating things like whether this is a prior authorization exists on it or not, things like that. I think that's where the capability around Cohere is.

I think it's also able to include a care collaboration as a part of the process, which makes it a little bit better. It has that utilization management capability also, which makes it a little bit downstream, applicable also.

That's where it's different from Anterior. It's weaker than Anterior from AI perspective, but it's stronger than Anterior in terms of just how many more offerings they have. I think that's how a little bit more different when it comes to that. That's what I would say.

## Client
Can you give me a couple more sentences around that care collaboration piece? Maybe that's care management, but I'm still struggling.

## Expert
When you look at the care collaboration a little bit, it is around the care management. It's not totally different as you say. You have the decision or you're looking at that prioritization. How do you improve using that? How do you improve member outcomes? Do you connect them to some specialty programs or not? I won't say this is a specific market differentiator or the game changer that nobody else is doing, but I was just only comparing to, let's say, Anterior in that case because that's a very intelligent prior auth solution. Cohere is also, I think, 90% of them is prior auth. Only about that 10% would be around the other care coordination piece I talked about.

## Client
Perfect. We've talked about Anterior, Change, Cohere. Is there one more that you'd like to talk about or are those three probably your greatest insight?

## Expert
I can talk, to some extent, about Apixio. Apixio also has a good product out there. It does have good capability around utilizing AI to automate and generally make right decisions around prior authorization. Perhaps the level of manual volume reduction is not the best-in-class. Some other vendors can get you up to like a 70% reduction in manual process. This, I would say, Maybe like a 40% reduction in manual process. I think it's lagging a little bit there.

I think it's a part of Datavant now, so it probably has other capabilities as I understand. That changes the story a little bit because Datavant is a bigger company. It has, I would say, a bunch of different capabilities that it does own. That makes it a little bit different. Apixio also does that risk adjustment piece. I think that has that extra capability that it not only does prior auth, it also does risk adjustment.

## Client
When you say risk adjustment, for someone who's not an expert in the field, is that identifying differences in potential patient costs?

## Expert
No. Risk adjustment is a very nuanced, but very important piece of the puzzle. Let's say, you are a patient and I am a patient. You have your own, both of us have, let's say, insurance from the same health plan. Based on that, you and I will have a different health score. Why is that? Because your risk score is based on your medical history, your clinical history, on your overall health, how your health has been.

Your medical history determines your risk score. Your utilization of services determines your risk score and the same goes for me. If I have knee pain and I go to the ER and then you have knee pain and you go to a primary care. From ER, I'm sent to have an MRI and then from the primary care, you are sent to get a physical therapy for knee pain.

Now, both of us have knee pain, but in your case, your risk score will be higher because you went to the ER and then you had an MRI. You drove up the cost of care really high for that health plan. They will code you as a high risk score member because your claims are more expensive. Based on that, they will adjust and price your policy separately. Subsequent, they would approach your employer differently in terms of how they package and sell a plan. Does that help?

This is super useful for me. Just to bring that home, in this example, let's say, I'm covered by my employer and you're covered by the same employer. I'm not going to get kicked off the commercial plan or anything. Is percentage of high risk scores used for negotiations with covering that employer in the future or where do those numbers matter?

## Expert
Yeah. It does matter in terms of, how much you would price your product to the employer? How much would you charge if you were charging a low price, but you saw that he had a lot of claims and it was a really high cost last year to provide insurance to him and there's 10 of you with that employer? A health plan would go and say, "Hey, listen, your risk score is very high. Your claim spend is really, really high. We need to charge you more because we are not able to cover our expenses."

## Client
This would only be for plans that are not self-funded?

## Expert
No. Risk score is for both self-funded and non-self-funded, fully insured and self-insured. It's an aggregate score about a member. The pricing is different, self-insured and fully insured. You think about those when you talk about pricing and packaging. Risk score has nothing to do with it. Risk score is just one member score.

## Client
Got it. Switching gears a little bit. I think I understand the risk score piece, thank you. More broadly, when you consider all of these vendors that you have seen, what do you think are some of the biggest inefficiencies or pain points with a PA process? I'm thinking of, for example, high rates of PA approvals I know are expensive, but I could also imagine that denials that then are forced to be turned into approvals after pushback would also be expensive.

## Expert
Yeah. We talked about some of the pain points earlier around data scanning and paper and things like that. Are you talking about pain points from a cost perspective?

## Client
I'm wondering, as you think of changes, what do you think is the biggest victory? Would it be increasing denials or is it actually just having the same denial-approval rate, but just doing that same decision more quickly? What do you think is the biggest marginal improvement, is my question.

## Expert
Yeah. I don't think it's the right way to think is to just increase the denial. Other people you talk to may have a different opinion on it. I personally think that's not the right approach because you may deny it. You probably heard of this phrase, a Penny-wise, pound-foolish. You deny somebody an MRI, ultimately, it turns out, because of that denial, they ended up getting through surgery.

That now is going to cost you like $40,000, as opposed to $4,000. I don't think that's the right way to look at it, just to deny. The right way to look at, in my mind, would be to essentially just think about, how do we make the right decisions? What's the accuracy level? Accuracy level would be the right way to make the best improvement in prioritization process.

## Client
Right. When you say accuracy level, you mean making a decision that is correct based on the data that would have been maybe approved?

Absolutely. Did you approve when you should have approved? Did you deny when you should have denied? That accuracy is important. I think that would be really good. I think that would be a good way to improve it. I think the next step for PA vendors.

## Client
Totally makes sense. Can I ask, when you see these vendors being integrated in a health plan, is it for a specific geography or specific specialty or more? How does that work?

## Expert
You mean for prior auth?

## Client
Yeah.

## Expert
No. Those are, essentially, it's agnostic. It's not specifically for commercial or whatnot. Usually, it applies to all lines of business. Everybody needs prior auth.

## Client
That makes sense. Do you think that these companies would ever consider developing something in-house compared to a vendor or everyone wants to outsource?

## Expert
No. It's possible that companies might want to do this in-house, absolutely, especially the bigger ones.

## Client
Right. It seems like there are several good options to

Yeah. There's good vendors out there. Health plans are generally right. You want to look at what's next and disruptive. Where do you put your best minds at work? What's the next game changer in healthcare? Prior auth, personally, it's just been around, just an operations type. It's an operation improvement. It's not the game changer, every payer needs prior auth. For me, this is just the table stakes.

As far as health plans choosing to invest the most products, energy and resources, your best minds are not going to be working on something like this. Your best minds would be working on building a lot of next solutions that we talked about. What's the next behavioral health solution? What's the next cure solution we built for diabetes? Some of the other things I talked about, I think that's more top of mind.

## Client
Right. That begs the question for me. If you had to pick one game changer, whether it be behavioral health, some digital health solution for diabetes, do you have one in mind?

## Expert
There's a few actually. I think, given where we are right now, behavioral health and, let's say, maternity health, those would be the game changers.

## Client
Got it. That makes sense based on some trends I've seen. I know we're coming up on time. To close us out and zoom back into prior auth, we talked about these three big pain points. If you could fix one of them or could fix one facet of the prior auth process, where would you start?

If I could fix, I would want to fix the paper. The process to remove the paperwork. That is where I think the biggest challenge is. We'll get to the other two pain points. We already made significant improvements on intelligent and thorough scanning and then making the right decision, accuracy of decision-making. We have made significant improvement there. What remains to be improved is a lot around what you may call the paperwork removal. It's not entirely at the hands of these vendors or at the hands of the health plans. It really relies on the different providers, do they embrace it or not?

I think they're definitely going to be happening for sure. It's just a matter of time and a generation piece. We still have baby boomers, we still have older people who are just not very comfortable with technology and are just not going to adopt, and that's okay. Those other people who are using the paper records. The younger generation adapters or providers, rather, they have already embraced EMR. Ultimately, as baby boomers retire, more and more of them go out of medical practice. We're going to be left with the generation that has already embraced technology.

## Client
Totally makes sense, that this transition really does rely on the providers as well.

## Expert
Correct, 100%.
