it represents?

### Expert
Sure. It has more than 10,000 beds, more than 30 locations and expanding through the Northeast. The revenue is more than $1 billion reported and around 30,000 full-time employees at the institute.

### Client
Got it. How many doctors out of the 30,000 employees?

### Expert
I believe around 30,000 would be the medical staff. In terms of actual MDs, do you know? Just the actual MD, I believe it would be around somewhere around 10,000, but honestly, please don't quote me on it. The influx coming in, going in, the opening of departments, that's a hard number for me to give.

### Client
Got it. You are in charge of information systems, is that correct?

### Expert
Yes.

### Client
Thank you so much. Can you walk me through what led you to adopt AI scribing systems? Why you decided to look for one and what was the driver or what were the drivers?

### Expert
I think major drivers were A) more efficiency in the clinic. One of the reasons we needed these systems in place was the medical staff was spending more time in note taking compared to interacting actively with patients. That's where the need arose. When the system was presented to us, everybody wanted to get on board with it, but our reservations were like, "How would it sync with our EMR systems?" the accuracy of the system, the medical terminology, and all. Those were our major concerns when we adapted it in the first place. That was also, again, the first concern was just that.

We realized as the more we used it, the better it got. With the pilot studies, we realized it just improved the efficiency of the system as well as the integration was good. Also it gave more time to the physicians to see more patients, which meant more ROI and revenue for the hospital systems at large.

### Client
Was RCM a concern either lowering denials or improving coding accuracy? Was that part of the goals?

### Expert
With Abridge, not necessarily, but overarchingly, yes, it was because everything just boils down to the denials, the claims, how many can be submit, that's where the revenue is coming from and what scripts are being ordered, so definitely that's why we needed the accuracy also of the system. To answer your question, overarching, it was.

### Client
Very helpful. First of all, what EMR do you use? Is it Epic?

### Expert
We use Epic.

### Client

Okay. Can you describe the process you put in place to evaluate the provider you ultimately chose? How many did you look at and how many did you cut with, if any?

### Expert
Sure. It was an RFP process. We invited RFPs. That was one of the main things we went with. We allowed them to showcase what value to bring, the features. We had very pointed questions based off of that. Once we shortlisted, I believe we shortlisted apart from Abridge, in the end, we also shortlisted Ambience system, and then it was mostly doing the pilot studies.

We did pilot studies over two quarters and that's the standard, just to get enough data over time, specifically with the AI integrated. After having received the feedback, that's when the pricing and negotiation sets in. Once those negotiations were set in place, how would we pay them? Based off of that, that's when we had the start date and everything fixed, when the implementation would take place. Those are happening side by side, but then it just kicks into the gear. Once we had that integration and implementation date in place, also we needed a certain amount of training with the team. Those were scheduled and that's when things were onboarded.

### Client
Sorry, just to be clear, did you pilot both Abridge and Ambience in parallel?

### Expert
Yes.

### Client
Okay. For how long and with how many clinicians?

### Expert
For two quarters as I mentioned? Both of them were for the same time, otherwise it's just comparing apples to oranges, so both of them were for two quarters but different teams.

### Client
How many users?

### Expert
We started off with 500 users on each. We chose a few department specialties. I believe we chose gastroenterology and neurology for Ambience, and then I believe it was urology and one more, so those two divisions, and then we just staggered out the data that way so that we could compare accordingly.

### Client
Got it. What drove the decision to go with Abridge?

### Expert
A) The integration as well as the robustness because the integration is also fine, but it has to integrate in real time with Epic. That was our main driving factors, and that's where our CM angle came to be, the accuracy as well as the robustness. That we felt was more with Abridge, and also the care team like the user-friendly interface, more of Abridge as compared to Ambience. It's not that the Ambience was not liked, it's just that Abridge was more preferred, usability-wise. From our end, for integration and all, it was just more robust as well.

### Client
Got it. When did the pilot end and when did you start implementing it in earnest?

### Expert

We finished implementation in November 2024. The pilot studies lasted and analysis and everything, all the decisions are now made by, I believe, early September of 2024.

### Client
Okay. Since November, you've been fully rolled out. How many clinicians did you roll it out to?

### Expert
It's system-wide. All our clinicians are using it right now.

### Client
When you say all clinicians, do you mean just the outpatient or also inpatient?

### Expert
Both.

### Client
Interesting. How many active users do you have?

### Expert
We have around 5,000 active users because it's not just the doctors we have on board. Certain MAs and BAs have also been granted access to it.

### Client
That's interesting. It's very unusual. You might be one of the only ones I've spoken to who does also inpatient. How is the inpatient side working out?

### Expert
We did later, actually. We implemented that in the third phase. It's still too early to tell when it comes to inpatient, but the outpatient has been a huge success as of now.

### Client
Okay, tell me more. What did it move the needle on?

### Expert
It was good feedback that we received for outpatient services and also the inpatient. Certain providers, we were hearing them, it would help streamline their workflows better. Our concern was again, the accuracy. We knew it's robust enough to handle us. We knew it integrates well with the system. Our concern was like, "How would that factor in?" Once we received positive feedback from the outpatient and we then did a few test studies, it was on pilot studies, just a few physicians tested it along with the peers in the outpatient department, and that's when we decided to roll it out.

### Client
I see. If you had to rate Abridge from 1-10, one being lowest and 10 being highest, what grade would you give them?

### Expert
I believe I would give them a good nine.

### Client
Okay. My understanding is that they have the scribing product, and then they also have a coding automation product and a nursing line product now. Do you just use scribing or do you use multiple products?

### Expert
No, we use them specifically for scribing right now. Would we entertain the other products? We've told them we'll have a conversation with them in the next budgeting session because with the budget constraints and all, we are also trying to be cost cognizant in the current scenario. To answer your question, we only use the scribing function.

### Client
Okay. Do you use their, I think it's not a fully-fledged coding product, but more like a coding suggestions? Do you use that as well?

### Expert
We have used them for that, specifically for coding. In RCM, we have a separate provider. Again, that provider syncs seemingly well with our Epic system and it's very, very robust. We have not had any reasons to revisit the contract with them yet. To answer your question, the answer would be no, not yet.

### Client
Okay. As you think about renewal with them, do you perform an ROI calculation? If you do, how you calculate it?

### Expert
Absolutely we do. Most of the renewals are ROI-based in Mount Sinai and it varies by factors. For instance, with RCM, it's going to be like the rate of denial, how soon was the revenue realized, the reimbursement rates, everything. With the Abridge system, it's also like how many patients have seen the difference we see because we just implemented it, the time saved, and how many patients served because of that, and then how much was the revenue realized. For the features, the parameters vary for the scribing function compared to the RCM or to the coding. Those are variables that we expect.

### Client
Prescribing, it's mostly on time saved and thus additional revenue opportunities.

### Expert
Mostly that because that was the need we were looking for, and accuracy all factors into that, time saved, how quickly the revenue was, did we have to go in and look back at everything manually, or was it seamless? That's another thing. Basically the time spent, seeing the patients is what we look at.

### Client
Got it. Do you take into account clinician satisfaction or turnover or things like that?

### Expert
Not necessarily clinician turnover because that has no bearing on this particular function, but definitely clinician satisfaction is factored in.

### Client
Got it. If you had to project three years out, do you think you spend more or less or the same with Abridge?

### Expert
We would like to spend the same. Less is not possible but we see us as spending a little bit more.

### Client
Got it. Hopefully with the good ROI still.

Absolutely.

### Client
How have they been to deal with in terms of customer support? How are the people at Abridge in your experience?

### Expert
We've only had positive feedback when it comes to dealing with the customer team, the tech support team, or even with the sales reps that we have. To answer that question, any concerns we have are addressed immediately. There's not a significant time lapse that we have seen. The integration was smooth because the two IT teams had to work really well together as well as with the Epic team. The experience has been great I would say that. We're happy with it that we made the choice.

### Client
Got it. If we take a step back and think about other uses of AI inside of your health system, you mentioned coding and RCM, do you work there with SmarterDx, or do you have another provider you work with?

### Expert
We work with R1 RCM.

### Client
I see. What are other big areas of AI usage inside of your system?

### Expert
I'll start off with Mount Sinai, among the top 10 smartest hospitals in the world, so we embrace AI in every sense of the word. That being said, we do a lot of vetting just because of the nature of the business we are in, like HIPAA compliance, regulations. Accuracy is utmost important to us.

To answer your question, we recognize the importance to the point because we are finding ourselves embracing it in every step of the way, be it revenue, like RCM, revenue generation, looking at the scheduling, even the patient scheduling, so all the parameters, to the point that, and this is public information, if you go online, you'll be able to see that, we actually have opened our own artificial intelligence division at Mount Sinai, at Icahn School of Medicine, just to address those needs. Not just research-wise, but also patient care-wise to be able to do that better. To answer your question, in every field. We are doing the same and we're adapting.

### Client
Got it. Are nursing lines a place where you have adopted something?

### Expert
I'll have to take a step back. Nursing, when it comes to education and continued education or even screening and billing and all, yes, we would, but just with the nature of it because nursing is a very unionized function at the hospital system. Not every function is AI-generated. We have to talk a lot to the unions to work with that. When it comes to the performance of AI, when it comes to recruitment, when it comes to training purposes, yes, we are looking into it and we have implemented quite a few.

### Client
Got it. Do nurses have access to Abridge already?

### Expert
Yes, they do. Not all, the head nurses for now.

Got it. Have you looked at potentially launching one of these AI-powered bots to replace the phone lines, the nurse lines?

### Expert
We have. To answer your question, our experience has not been the best at it. It's not that we are very happy with the call lines as well, but with the bot lines, specifically when it's a senior citizen, they realized. Interacting with the bot lines, we have not received the best feedback yet. Will that change in the future? Only future knows better, but we have looked into it.

### Client
Got it. What about on the clinical side? An AI that suggests, either reviews the chart and suggests diagnoses or pushes relevant medical literature, a clinical copilot, is something that you've looked at?

### Expert
Yes, we have. We've looked at it not only for the diagnosis but also for continued education for physicians as well for our MDs, the staff, our residents in training. We have looked into those as well. That being said, when it comes to diagnosis, we still don't rely 100% just on AI. I'll explain why. The way we use it, say for instance a rheumatologist suggests a particular test, let's say it's an uncap test just for argument's sake, looking at the patterns and looking at the algorithm and all, so the AI does give us suggested results, "We suggested result as patient has, for instance, a." or whatnot.

That being said, we still need the physician to sign off on it and the medical director to sign off on it because while we appreciate getting those AI suggested results, it makes the job of the clinician much easier, we still want them to use due diligence before signing off and giving the results to the patients and going ahead with treatment. Using the diagnosis for treatment we have not yet implemented. I don't see that happening anytime soon. Yes, suggested results, we do get them all the time with the AI-enabled features that we have in our diagnostic labs. We do do that.

### Client
Got it. Which providers have you used for that?

### Expert
Quite a few. In rheumatology now we use instrumentation that's already AI-enabled, one of them is EUROIMMUN. I can recall from the top of my head, it's a German company and I think right now it's Revvity. They're already built into the systems, actually. When we purchase those systems, they're already AI-enabled, sometimes they're already AI-enabled. R1 for revenue generation is AI-enabled, and at the same time, diagnostics is also AI-enabled with the systems as such.

### Client
Got it. It's more specialty dependent then?

### Expert
Yeah, it is all special. Diagnosis is always specialty dependent. It is not one umbrella that fits at all, not yet.

### Client
Got it. Have you looked at Regard by any chance?

### Expert
We have considered them, but I can't recollect the specifics to be honest with you. Maybe think about it to answer those questions.

### Client
Out of curiosity, do you use the models themselves? Do you use OpenAI and Anthropic, for example, out of

the box versus Abridge that has an applied side to it?

### Expert
Yeah, we use them all the time. I'm pretty sure if you walk into any of the admin offices, you'll find them using it. To answer your question, yes, we do.

### Client
Got it. If OpenAI or Anthropic were to develop their own scribing product, do you see yourself switching, for example, to one of those? Do you like that Abridge is specifically integrated with Epic, etc. and would prefer to stay with a healthcare focused one?

### Expert
If Abridge ups their game and offers similar features that they would offer the two combined, we see no reason why not to stick with Abridge because it works for us, and with technology, they're constant enhancements. However, if there are any glitches in the system or if it cannot keep up with our demand or cannot stay as robust as it is right now, or faculty and staff ask for more features and it cannot offer those but are being offered by OpenAI, then I don't see why they won't switch.

### Client
Got it. What about Epic? Have they signaled to you that they would develop their own products, and would you be interested in their scribing products if they sold one?

### Expert
Actually they are developing the scribing products. That is what I know what I have heard from the reps. We haven't tried it on, but once it's ready, we would love to try because then it is just one solution answers all our questions. Honestly speaking, it's Epic right now in its field, seamless, almost negligible errors, great service. Everything they implement, every software they implement, we look for its integration with Epic as of now. If it offers its own product, unless it is not on quality or not on par, we don't see why not to stick with them. The thing is with Epic, it raises the bar higher. You would expect it to be better, if not at the same level as Abridge. It comes with that extra load on it.
