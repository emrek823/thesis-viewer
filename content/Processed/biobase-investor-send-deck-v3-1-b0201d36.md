# Biobase Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: biobase

**Agentic Operating System for Clinical Data**

Medical innovation needs data now more than ever.

Our agentic platform structures and links multimodal data with minimal overhead, and connects suppliers with researchers through intelligent, conversational discovery.

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Data Suppliers
Labs, health systems, and CROs want to monetize their data while minimizing overhead and distraction

*   **Messy Data Retrieval**
    Rich metadata buried in PDFs, spreadsheets, legacy databases
*   **Core Business Disconnect**
    In-house sales diverts resources away from core business model
*   **The Revenue Trap**
    One-time transactions with distributors, no residual value
*   **Missed Connections**
    Locating qualified buyers is complex and time consuming

### Buyers
Pharma, biotech, and AI developers want reliable access to data so that they can focus on drug discovery, medical device, assay and algorithm development

*   **Finding a Needle in a Haystack**
    Critical projects stall for months while manually searching fragmented catalogs
*   **More Quotes, More Cost**
    Weeks requesting quotes from multiple suppliers, wildly different prices, incomplete orders
*   **Unclear Data Provenance**
    Can't count on data being consented, etc.
*   **Post-Acquisition Data Structuring**
    Data received is messy

## Slide 3: Our Solution

*   **Agentic Marketplace**
    Supplier metadata hosted on Biobase Platform, all transactions generate revenue share
*   **Dynamic Knowledge Integration**
    Continuously ingests new supplier data and research terminology
*   **Automated Data Retrieval**
    RAG agents autonomously search through suppliers' rich, multimodal clinical data
*   **Intelligent Request Processing**
    RAG agents understand research context and translate to precise supplier queries
*   **Conversational Discovery**
    Natural language interaction for complex multi-parameter searches
*   **One-Stop-Shop**
    The only platform where one query finds data across all suppliers simultaneously

Simplifying data transactions, accelerating scientific discoveries

## Slide 8: Fueling Drug Discovery: The Biobank + AI Data Market

### Biobanks as the foundation of modern drug development
For decades, pharma and biotech have depended on physical tissue, blood, and molecular samples. Today's virtual biobanks—combined with EHR, outcomes, and omics data—are the raw material for AI-driven target discovery, translational research, personalized therapeutics, and clinical trial design.

### Global Biobank & Research Data Market ($B)
**8.4% CAGR → $150 B+ by 2029 fueling AI & translational pipelines**

| Year | Market Size (USD B) |
| :--- | :------------------ |
| 2024 | 60                  |
| 2025 | 70                  |
| 2026 | 80                  |
| 2027 | 90                  |
| 2028 | 105                 |
| 2029 | 120                 |

*(Note: The graph visually shows values higher than the listed data points, with 2029 appearing to be around $115B-$120B in the graph, not $150B as stated in the text. The text states "$150 B+ by 2029", which is not reflected by the graph's highest point.)*

### Biobase is the API-first marketplace powering on-demand R&D data
We connect every biobank and clinical data holder directly to pharma, biotech, and AI labs via a secure, HIPAA-compliant API. Researchers get instant access to cohorts, pathology slides, molecular profiles, and real-world evidence—plus our agentic AI to clean, harmonize, and enrich it.

### Global Pharmaceutical R&D Spend ($B)
**2% CAGR**

| Year | R&D Spend (USD B) |

## Slide 14: Our Foundation

The core beliefs, mission, and vision that drive everything we do at Biobase

### Thesis
Our core belief

**Biobase Thesis**
Healthcare and life-science data today are siloed across hospitals, labs, CROs, and research institutions—fragmented by formats, governed by disparate policies, and inaccessible to many stakeholders. This fragmentation slows scientific discovery, hinders precision medicine, and limits patients' agency over their own information. We believe that by unifying clinical, research, and ultimately patient-owned data in a single, AI-driven ecosystem, we can ignite a new era of collaborative innovation—where every data point fuels better diagnostics, therapies, and outcomes, and where patients themselves reclaim ownership of their health journey.

### Mission
What we do

**Biobase Mission**
To empower researchers, clinicians, and patients with seamless, secure access to the world's richest healthcare and research data. We deliver a compliant, multimodal data platform—integrating EHRs, pathology, molecular profiles, and real-world evidence—augmented by agentic AI tools that automate discovery, cleaning, and cohort building. By bridging the clinical and research worlds and laying the groundwork for patient-centric data stewardship, we accelerate breakthroughs and democratize the insights needed to transform medicine.

### Vision
Where we're going

**Biobase Vision**
A future where every individual owns and controls a living, dynamic record of their health—empowering them to share, monetize, or leverage their data at will. Biobase will lead this transformation by creating the infrastructure that makes patient-owned health data not just possible, but profitable and powerful for advancing human health.
