## Concerns about the legitimacy and integrity of Nucleus Genomics

Table of Contents

## Introduction

My husband and I have recently been considering starting a family together (*i.e.,* having children). Naturally, wanting to give my children the best chance at a healthy, successful life, I spent some time over the past several weeks personally surveying the landscape of embryo selection companies. These companies essentially facilitate *in vitro* fertilization by using polygenic scores to help you select the ‘best’ embryo.

This post isn’t meant as an introduction to the field of polygenic testing; for those who want a broader overview, Scott Alexander’s recent post [recent post](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/suddenly-trait-based-embryo-selection) is an excellent primer which compares the current players in the field. Instead, the purpose of this post is simple: as I started learning more about [Nucleus Genomics](https://mynucleus.com/) and researching their newly launched product, [Nucleus Origin,](https://mynucleus.com/labs/origin) I noticed a number of increasingly bizarre inconsistencies and errors in their promotional content. In addition, I also noticed that they are apparently [currently being sued by a competitor,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genomic-prediction-files-federal-lawsuit-214500531.html) Genomic Prediction, for what appears to be egregious IP theft.

Upon further exploration, I realized that their entire Nucleus Origin whitepaper, touted as a novel AI breakthrough in the field of “genetic optimization,” was essentially full of basic errors that were so flagrant that a dilettante in the field like myself was able to spot them with a cursory review. Worse, the entire whitepaper appears to have been cribbed wholesale from a competitor’s medRxiv preprint.

After conducting more background research, I concluded that Nucleus Origin was essentially meant as a response to a [competitor’s whitepaper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.06.25333145v2) claiming to show that Nucleus systematically misrepresents the predictive validity of their polygenic scores (PGS). The claims in that whitepaper, if true, are fairly damning and, even after the release of the Nucleus Origin whitepaper, largely go unaddressed. I strongly recommend that any reader curious to learn more about Nucleus also spend some time closely reading the linked critique.

In this article, I begin by documenting a series of bizarre and misleading claims made by Nucleus in their marketing material. It was these discrepancies which led me “down the rabbit hole,” so to speak, and prompted me to examine the technical claims made by Nucleus in closer detail. Afterward, I discuss the allegations made about borderline fraudulent misrepresentation of their polygenic scores and their obvious plagiarism of a Herasight whitepaper for their own product.

Having children is one of the most consequential decisions that a family can make. It obviously follows that if you’re choosing a company to help you through the IVF and embryo selection process, you should probably care about the quality and integrity of that company’s work. I would recommend any prospective parent considering Nucleus as a service provider to carefully examine the claims made in this article and come to their own conclusions.

## Down the rabbit hole

Nucleus Genomics is a genetic testing company that’s been around since at least [2021](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/nucleus-genomics-announces-3-5m-seed-round-for-a-fresh-take-on-genetic-tests/). Earlier this year, they launched a [carrier screening product](https://fortune.com/well/article/genetic-matching-feature-parents-ceo-eugenics/) and shortly afterward a [polygenic embryo screening product](https://www.newsweek.com/parents-ivf-genetic-makeup-testing-2081470) through a [partnership](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nucleus-genomics-launches-nucleus-embryo-genetic-optimization-software-alongside-partnership-with-genomic-prediction-302473350.html) with Genomic Prediction (the same company now suing them for IP theft). They claim to “screen for 2000 conditions”, which seem to mostly constitute single-gene disorders along with a few dozen polygenic traits.

Their [website](https://mynucleus.com/) is sleek, with testimonials from satisfied customers plastered all over each product page. So far, so good, right? However, upon closer inspection, there are a number of obvious inconsistencies. The degree and severity of some of these inconsistencies are great enough that they really make one wonder about whether there are any legitimate reviews on the website at all.

### Potentially fictitious customer reviews

One [simple example:](https://mynucleus.com/ivf)

![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-6-1024x614.png)

It is chronologically impossible for these reviews to be true because Nucleus started offering carrier screening [in the spring of 2025](https://fortune.com/well/article/genetic-matching-feature-parents-ceo-eugenics/) and their IVF product in [May 2025](https://www.newsweek.com/parents-ivf-genetic-makeup-testing-2081470). It is currently November 2025, meaning that no couple could have even gone through carrier screening and IVF with Nucleus and had a successful conception at the time of writing, let alone produce a child mature enough to walk or grow a full head of hair.

I will admit that it’s theoretically possible that Nucleus started offering their carrier screening to individuals well before the official launch of their services. However, given that the picture of the family in the middle is cribbed from a [random AgelessRX article](https://agelessrx.com/why-is-longevity-important/), and the woman on the left from stock photography titled [Mother Carrying Her Baby,](https://www.pexels.com/photo/mother-carrying-her-baby-3819603/) I think the more likely possibility is that these reviews are total fabrications.

Or perhaps compare these two testimonials:

![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-7-1024x358.png)
![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-9-1024x358.png)

Wow, these two Verified Nucleus Members sure have very similar writing styles! In the process of writing this article, I took multiple screenshots of these testimonials, and it’s interesting that 3 weeks ago, “TJ P.” was also listed as having joined 2 weeks ago. Also, he appears to have recently changed his name:

![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-41.png)

What about the handsome Yasir A.?

![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-11-1024x358.png)

It’s not surprising that with such striking facial features, he also seems to moonlight as a [model for stock photographers](https://unsplash.com/photos/man-in-black-zip-up-jacket-8BcVHmAHtlw) and of course no wonder that Nucleus chose to prominently display the well known masterpiece of stock photography, “man in black zip up jacket” (“photography in Noida, India by Naim Ahmed”). What a cosmopolitan business!

In fact, in between the time I began writing this post and the time of posting, Yasir seems to also have undergone a [remarkable](https://mynucleus.com/family/shop) racial transmogrification despite his result being calibrated to those “who share the same ancestry as me”:

![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-42-1024x381.png)

These are arguably all relatively minor misrepresentations in the grand scheme of things; however, there is one particularly egregious and potentially even dangerous case here, namely that of Jeffrey B.:

![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-14.png)

The X.com link does not work and the profile photo is obviously AI-generated:

![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-15.png)

It’s difficult to know for sure, but I think this review actually comes from a paid reviewer who is actually named [Jeffrey B.](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCPjOkvvr4R/), in reality a pasty white European-American. Attaching a Black man’s picture to his review is especially misleading due to ancestry mismatch, because [Nucleus](https://mynucleus.com/deep-dives/embryo) “modulate[s] the polygenic score’s estimated predictive power according to the genetic distance of the user’s ancestry from the ancestry of the training population to ensure non-European populations can still receive rigorous, meaningful genetic analysis results today”. The real Jeffrey B. later [posted](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCW2KzmxA1d/?hl=en) that his results were informative with respect to his unexpectedly high predicted Alzheimer’s risk of 70% and, despite his family history, low predicted risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).

The reason this is an issue is because it’s well known that the ethnic portability of polygenic scores (i.e. how well a PGS works in a different population than the one it was trained on) varies depending on the degree of mismatch between these two populations, something that has to be taken into account when reporting results. Therefore, it wouldn’t be the case that Jeffrey’s supposedly informative predicted CAD risk would also apply to the advertised Jeffrey B., who appears to be an AI-generated black man (similarly, given that Yasir A.’s reviews above show mismatched stock and AI-generated photos, I imagine the same issue applies to a lesser degree to him as well). Oh, and given that Nucleus’ CAD PGS seems to be severely miscalibrated compared to a third party validation (more on this later), their results for the true Jeffrey B. are *also* almost certainly miscalibrated.

I understand that marketing is important, and I’m not lambasting Nucleus for spending effort on promoting their product. However, as I mentioned above, choosing a provider for embryo selection entails choosing a company with which you’ll form a relationship of deep trust. It’s difficult to imagine how I could in good conscience choose Nucleus to select the embryo who will be *my future child* when they distort facts as basic as the racial transferability of their results in service of getting customers.

### Obviously AI-generated blog posts

There isn’t anything intrinsically wrong with using AI to write blog posts, and evaluations of writing style remain matters of taste. However, it does seem concerning when most, if not all, posts are completely drafted by AI and posted without any manual review (just take a look [here](https://mynucleus.com/blog)).

How do I know that this happened? Well, before they started offering their IVF product, they published a [review of Orchid Health,](https://archive.ph/5wkFM) a competitor which also offers polygenic embryo screening, where Nucleus actually includes a theoretical critique of polygenic risk scores:

![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-43-715x1024.png)
![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-44-1024x959.png)

This is obviously absurd given that Nucleus themselves develop and sell polygenic risk scores and clearly indicates that nobody bothered to even skim this post before putting it online. It appears that they’ve updated the post to remove the egregious sections since the page was last archived (which appears to be shortly after Nucleus launched their own IVF product), but it is a curious strategy to push out AI slop criticizing a company’s product on ethical grounds and then immediately pull it after they themselves began offering the product.

### Accusations of intellectual property theft from Genomic Prediction

When searching for recent news about Nucleus, I discovered an even more dramatic twist to this story: it seems Genomic Prediction, a competing embryo selection company—*and also their [business partner](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nucleus-genomics-launches-nucleus-embryo-genetic-optimization-software-alongside-partnership-with-genomic-prediction-302473350.html)*—filed a [federal lawsuit](https://www.law.com/radar/card/pm-60733738-genomic-prediction-inc-v-treff) against Nathan Treff (one of the co-founders of GP, who recently moved to Nucleus), Talia Metzgar, and Nucleus Genomics a few weeks ago, alleging theft of trade secrets and confidential information. Here is the Law.com summary:

> According to the suit, Treff [one of the co-founders of GP] **deleted data from his company laptop and disabled security cameras** before his abrupt resignation in August 2025, while Metzgar **emailed 30 confidential documents to her personal account,** enabling Nucleus to rapidly expand into embryonic DNA testing using Genomic Prediction’s proprietary methods.

If the claims made are true, they are fairly damning—they suggest that Treff and Metzgar blatantly absconded from GP with proprietary, business-critical data and immediately transplanted that data straight into Nucleus.

To me, however, the most interesting part of such court intrigue is always *how* the existence of the criminal acts comes to light to begin with. In principle, it’s not terribly difficult to commit a ‘perfect crime;’ being hired away by a competitor is no great sin, and it’s not like every single departing employee is automatically scrutinized for theft of intellectual property. So how, exactly, did they slip up?

Reading the [full complaint](http://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/https-ecf-njd-uscourts-gov-doc1-119123173989.pdf) in Genomic Prediction Inc. v. Treff *et al.* is quite illuminating. It appears that GP first became aware of their (allegedly) duplicitous actions from … the Nucleus president sending emails to Treff’s old GP email address after his departure.

For those readers taking notes on how to orchestrate your own theft of trade secrets, I would recommend not explicitly antagonizing your previous employer immediately after your departure even as they hire you back as a consultant:

![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3-1024x578.png)

The entire matter is frankly a little baffling to me. It’s obvious that Nucleus and GP are now competitors, and Treff and Metzgar both signed 18-month noncompetes with GP, so what did they expect when they joined Nucleus and immediately launched polygenic scoring for embryos?

![](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-4-1024x295.png)

Apparently, their solution was to simply claim that Nucleus is not a competitor of GP, which I suspect will prove to be a rather ill-conceived plan.

At this point it seems pretty clear that Nucleus is willing to play a bit loose and fast with consensus reality, but who among us
