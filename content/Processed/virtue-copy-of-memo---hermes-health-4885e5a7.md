# Identified Health Data Market

## Overview of Identified Health Data Ecosystem

The identified medical data market is composed of six key players:

The Provider: Medical facilities, such as hospitals and clinics, where patient records originate.

~50,000 Providers.

The EHR Providers: Electronic Health Record systems are software platforms that host medical data.

~ 500 EHR Vendors.

Data Sources: Datasources such as claims aggregators, clearing house, and lab providers with access to identified data

~100 Vendors

The Release of Information (ROI) Vendor: Third-party vendors that manage record retrieval for providers.

~50 ROI vendors.

The Copy Services: Vendors that handle requests from Requestors. They use large call centers to contact providers and ROI vendors to retrieve medical records.

The Requestor: Individuals or organizations requesting medical records, such as lawyers, insurance companies, and patients.

There are roughly 100,000 Requestors.

The identified medical data market flow through this ecosystem in a many-to-many relationship:

Providers generate the records.

Records are stored in EMRs or Data Sources.

ROI Vendors or Copy Services retrieve the records.

Records are ultimately delivered to Requestors.

## Market Fragmentation

The identified medical data market is fragmented and complicated by numerous stakeholders: This fragmentation creates challenges for clients who need efficient, secure access to medical records:

Multiple Intermediaries: Navigating multiple intermediaries, such as copy service companies and healthcare facilities, leads to delays and increased costs.

Inefficient Processes: Many healthcare providers rely on outdated methods such as fax or mail for medical record submission and receipt, causing delays and increased error rates. Manual processes make it difficult to keep track of patient records and their status.

Variance in Compliance: Ensuring compliance with HIPAA across various stakeholders, each with their own data handling practices, adds significant legal and compliance risk.

## Market Economics

Each stakeholder in the ecosystem takes a margin on medical record requests, which inflates costs for Requestors. Below is a breakdown of typical fees per medical record retrieval:

For example, if a lawyer requests a record directly from an EMR, the cost is $2 per record. However, if the same record is requested through a Copy Service, the total cost rises to $65 per record.

Requestors are incentivized to work with vendors lower in the stack to reduce costs and improve speed. However, this approach has limitations:

Integrating directly with each EMR vendor or Data Source is impractical for most Requestors due to the high technical complexity and contracting.

Large players may pursue integration with a wide range of vendors out of necessity, but this approach is resource-intensive and not strategically advantageous.

## Opportunity for Middleware Solution

The fragmented nature of the market and the high margins retained by intermediaries create a strong case for a middleware solution. Such a platform could:

Simplify the Process: Abstract the complexity of dealing with multiple stakeholders, offering a single interface for access to medical data.

Reduce Costs: Integrate with major EMR systems, ROI vendors, and Copy Services, enabling cost savings that can be passed to end-users.

Ensure Security and Compliance: Create a robust and secure platform that protects data by implementing robust encryption protocols, multi-factor authentication, and regular compliance audits to align with HIPAA and other data protection regulations.

By addressing these inefficiencies, a middleware solution could revolutionize the identified health data market, creating value for all stakeholders and setting a new standard for efficiency and affordability.

# Release of Information: Market Dynamics, Incentive Structures, and Opportunity

## Release of Information Services

Release of Information (ROI) is a process where a specialized company partners with a healthcare provider to manage the back-office operations for medical record requests. The ROI companies effectively become the provider's record management arm, responsible for processing, managing, and securely releasing medical records to authorized Requestors, such as patients, attorneys, insurance companies, and researchers. About 50% of Providers use a ROI Vendor the other half do it themselves.The ROI vendor charges a fee to each requester.

## ROI Vendor Business Strategies

ROI vendors aim to improve performance through two key strategies:

Expanding Footprint: Increasing the number of healthcare providers they serve, thus growing their volume of requests and revenue.

Reducing Operational Costs: Streamlining processes and adopting technology to lower per-request costs, increasing profitability.

## Challenges Facing ROI Vendors

ROI vendors face six significant challenges that impact their profitability, scalability, and operations::

Lack of Pricing Control: Because ROI vendors handle only a fraction of all record requests, they struggle to secure direct contracts with Requestors. This reliance on fragmented agreements forces them to comply with state and federal pricing regulations, limiting their ability to set competitive rates and constraining revenue growth.

Manual Processes and Margin Compression: A significant portion of record requests are still processed using outdated methods such as fax and mail. Manual intake costs approximately $4 per record, while manual delivery adds an additional $5. These inefficiencies significantly erode margins, making it increasingly difficult to sustain profitability.

Underutilization by Requestors: The fragmented workflows required to navigate multiple ROI vendors discourages Requestors from fully utilizing record retrieval services. Requestors often retrieve records only for specific use cases, leaving a large portion of potential revenue untapped.

Challenges with Technology Adoption: ROI vendors face difficulty in getting Requestors to adopt their APIs and modern platforms. This challenge arises because each ROI vendor solution is bespoke, with no standardization across the industry, creating friction for Requestors who must adapt to multiple unique systems.

Messy Request Information: Many record requests are unnecessary or misdirected, creating additional workload without generating revenue. This issue stems from the lack of a robust preprocessing pipeline to clean and validate request data before it is submitted, leading to inefficiencies and wasted effort. For example, record requests are often routed to the wrong provider because of outdated address data.

Billing Challenges and Payment Delays: ROI vendors frequently experience significant issues with unpaid record requests. Since prepayment is rarely required up front, they often bear the initial costs of retrieving records while facing delays or difficulties in collecting payments after the service is completed.

## Hermes Solutions for ROI Vendors

Solution: Direct Contracting

Context: HIPAA regulations cap pricing for specific use cases like treatment and individual access but do not apply to contracts negotiated directly between ROI vendors and Requestors.

Problem: ROI vendors rarely secure direct contracts due to their limited market coverage, forcing them to abide by regulated pricing structures.

Hermes Solution: As a middleware platform, Hermes Health can negotiate flat pricing agreements with ROI vendors on behalf of Requestors. This model enables ROI vendors to bypass regulatory caps, offering more competitive pricing while maintaining profitability.

Outcome: Greater pricing flexibility for ROI vendors and reduced operational costs through standardized contracts.

Solution: Digitize Record Requests Intake and Delivery

Context: Manual intake and delivery processes remain a significant cost driver for ROI vendors, with combined expenses of $9 per record.

Problem: The lack of digitized workflows increases costs and delays. Efforts to digitize have led to fragmented systems, making it difficult for Requestors to navigate multiple platforms, creating an adoption challenge.

Hermes Health Solution: Hermes Health serves as an intermediary, digitizing both the intake and delivery processes for ROI vendors. By unifying these workflows under a single API and Platform, Hermes Health eliminates the need for multiple system integrations.

Outcome: Digitization lowers intake and delivery costs to $0.03 per record vs manual intake and delivery of $9 - creating margin expansion for ROI vendors.

### Solution: Unified Medical Record Retrieval Platform

Context: The fragmented nature of the medical record retrieval process requires Requestors to navigate multiple ROI vendors, each with bespoke systems and workflows. This complexity discourages Requestors from fully leveraging retrieval services, leading to underutilization for many potential use cases.

Problem: Requestors face high administrative burdens and inefficiencies when managing workflows across multiple ROI vendors. As a result, they limit their retrieval efforts to only the most critical or high-value use cases, leaving significant opportunities untapped.

Hermes Health Solution: Hermes Health provides a unified middleware platform that integrates with ROI vendors’ systems, offering Requestors a single access point for all record retrievals. Through a single dashboard and preprocessing tools, Hermes Health streamlines submissions, tracks request statuses in real time, and ensures data validation before requests are submitted, eliminating errors and unnecessary delays.

Outcome: By reducing barriers to Requestors ROI Vendors see increased Record Requests increasing revenue.

Solution: Standardized API Integration

Context: ROI vendors rely on bespoke APIs and proprietary platforms, each tailored to their unique systems. This lack of standardization creates significant friction for Requestors, who must adapt to multiple incompatible systems to retrieve medical records, making adoption of new technologies cumbersome and inefficient.

Problem: The absence of a standardized API across ROI vendors leads to low adoption rates of advanced technology platforms by Requestors. This results in inefficient workflows, higher costs for both Requestors and ROI vendors, and a slower transition to digitized record retrieval processes.

Hermes Health Solution: Hermes Health serves as a middleware platform offering a standardized API that integrates with multiple ROI vendors’ systems. Requestors gain a unified access point for submitting and tracking record requests, eliminating the need to adapt to multiple bespoke APIs. The platform also includes tools to streamline the onboarding process for Requestors and ensure seamless interoperability between systems.

Outcome: Requestors experience a simplified and consistent technology interface, encouraging higher adoption rates. ROI vendors benefit from reduced costs associated with bespoke API maintenance, increased efficiency, and greater request volume due to streamlined workflows. This accelerates the industry's transition to modern, digitized processes.

Solution: Preprocessing and Validation Pipeline

Context: ROI vendors frequently receive incomplete, misdirected, or unnecessary requests due to a lack of standardized preprocessing for submitted information. This creates inefficiencies, increases workloads, and results in wasted resources without generating additional revenue.

Problem: Without a robust preprocessing pipeline, ROI vendors must manually handle errors, validate requests, and resolve misdirected submissions. This adds operational costs, increases turnaround times, and reduces the overall efficiency of the record retrieval process.

Hermes Health Solution: Hermes Health implements a preprocessing and validation pipeline that cleans, validates, and organizes request data before submission to ROI vendors. This pipeline ensures that requests are accurate, complete, and routed to the correct facilities, reducing errors and unnecessary processing.

Outcome: ROI vendors experience reduced workloads and lower operational costs due to fewer misdirected or incomplete requests. Requestors benefit from faster processing times and improved success rates, leading to a more streamlined and efficient medical record retrieval ecosystem.

Solution: Prepayment and Automated Billing

Context: ROI vendors often fulfill record requests before receiving payment, leaving them responsible for collection efforts post-retrieval. This results in frequent payment delays, unpaid requests, and cash flow challenges, which can strain their operations.

Problem: The lack of a robust billing system forces ROI vendors to manage complex post-retrieval collections, increasing administrative overhead and financial risk. Payment delays and uncollected fees impact profitability and hinder operational efficiency.

Hermes Health Solution: Hermes Health introduces a prepayment and automated billing system as part of its middleware platform. Requestors are required to prepay or provide secured payment authorization before their requests are processed. Hermes Health facilitates automated invoicing, payment tracking, and reconciliation, ensuring ROI vendors receive timely and accurate payments.

Outcome: ROI vendors experience improved cash flow and reduced administrative burdens related to collections. Requestors benefit from a transparent and streamlined payment process, ensuring fewer disputes and delays. This system enhances financial stability and operational efficiency for all stakeholders.

## Partnerships with ROI companies

Hermes Health is a two-side marketplace of ROI Vendors and Requestors. Success requires access to both a critical mass of charts and many Requestors. Requestors will adopt Hermes Health solutions only if they can easily pull the majority of charts through the platform. ROI Vendors will only work with Hermes Health if they can cut costs. Below are some ideas to build the flywheel for ROI Vendors.

Hermes Health adopts a Palantir-like model. We operate as forward deployed engineers for ROI Vendors to streamlining their medical request intake and management processes.

We onboard ROI Vendors API into our tech stack enabling them to onboard digital requests faster, thereby saving them costs.

For ROI Vendors that do not have an API for a consulting fee we can implement a non-exclusive API that can be leveraged by the Hermes Platform.

# Requestors: Value Proposition, Volume, and Target Market

Requestors are companies such as attorneys, insurance companies, research organizations, healthcare providers, and digital health companies. These companies require access to identified medical data to operate their business and provide value to their clients.

## Requestor Business Leveres

Requestors aim to improve business performance through three key strategies in relation to their need to access identified medical data.

Reduce Data Acquisition Costs: Decreasing the per unit cost of identified medical data.

Reduce Operational Costs: Streamlining access to identified medical data through technology.

Increase Speed to Access Data: Access medical data quicker

## Challenges Facing Requestors

The problem is that Vendors (ROI EMR, and Data Sources) view the healthcare providers—the hospitals, clinics, or other medical facilities—as their main clients, not Requestors. As a result, Requestors face significant challenges in impacting their business levers.

High Administrative Burden: Requestors must navigate multiple ROI vendors, EMRs, Data Sources, and healthcare facilities, each with unique submission protocols.

Requests are often managed using spreadsheets or disconnected systems, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and repetitive manual tasks like follow-ups and corrections.

Billing is complex, with each request generating a unique invoice, and flat-fee pricing requires separate agreements with multiple vendors.

Identifying the correct medical facility or provider is challenging, particularly for patients treated at multiple locations, leading to misrouted or rejected requests that further delay access to critical records.

Due to the disparate systems getting up to date information on the status of a request is hard.

High Costs & Scalability Issues: Each intermediary in the retrieval chain adds a margin, driving up costs for Requestors. Manual processes, rejected requests, and inefficient workflows further contribute to financial strain. Building direct relationships to end sources is time and resource consuming making it impossible at scale. Requestors managing high volumes of medical record requests (e.g., mass tort attorneys or large insurance companies) face scalability issues. Current workflows are not designed to handle bulk requests efficiently, causing bottlenecks and increasing costs.

Long Turnaround Time: Getting access to identified medical data is slow, often taking weeks or months due to manual workflows, fragmented systems, and limited standardization.

Labor-Intensive Data Abstraction: Raw medical records are often lengthy and unstructured, requiring manual review and abstraction by people. This process is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to human error. Requestors like legal firms, insurers, and researchers need specific, actionable data points, but current workflows rely heavily on manual labor to extract this information, increasing turnaround times and costs

Data Privacy and Security Challenges: Handling sensitive health information requires adherence to complex regulations like HIPAA. Requestors must ensure secure data transfer and storage, adding significant operational complexity. Non-standardized compliance practices across ROI vendors and intermediaries exacerbate the challenge, increasing risk and inefficiency.

# Hermes Health Products & Solutions

Hermes Health is building two core products to meet the needs of Requestor: Unified Medical Record Portal and Identified Data Workflows.

## Unified Medical Record Portal

Centralize Communications (Mock Ups)

Problem: Requestors currently manage requests, payment, and updates on different spreadsheets and files. They have no central repository of information. This causes a lot of administrative overhead which costs time and money. A core assumption here is that the ROI vendors can retrieve the majority of records digitally

Solution: Build a streamlined dashboard that takes all of the information from across Requestors and centralizes requests, payments, and updates into a central application. The application will also have roles and permissions to improve compliance.

Streamlined Workflows: Hermes Health consolidates the fragmented medical record retrieval process into a single, unified platform. This eliminates the need to navigate multiple systems, reducing administrative overhead and simplifying operations.

Automated Processes: By automating routine tasks such as request submission, tracking, and follow-ups, we reduce manual effort and free up staff to focus on higher-value activities.

Centralized Management: All requests, communications, and documents are managed within one intuitive dashboard, simplifying oversight and reducing the likelihood of errors.

Real-Time Tracking: Requestors can monitor the status of their requests in real time, allowing for proactive management and quicker responses to any issues that arise.

Accelerated Processing: Through seamless API integrations with major ROI vendors and EMR systems, Hermes Health reduces average medical record retrieval times by 50%, from 30 days to approximately 15 days.

Prioritized Requests: Our platform enables the prioritization of urgent requests, ensuring critical records are retrieved as quickly as possible.

Analytics and Reporting: Provides detailed analytics on request patterns, turnaround times, and vendor performance, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize processes.

Value Proposition: Simplified submissions and integrated statistics reduces administrative overhead and costs.

Speed through API Integration

Problem: Currently Requestors need to submit requests across multiple copy service providers and hospital systems. This leads to huge administrative overhead, repetitive work, and increased timelines.

Solution: Integrate the APIs of ROI Companies (Datavant, Verisma, MRO) to simply record submission and retrieval. An integrated API can also information is unified across the different partners providing a unified experience. Below is a rough number of the possible integrations that are possible:

ROI Companies: 40+ APIs

EMR: 500 APIs

HIE: 500 APIs

For use cases requiring consent, Hermes Health will need to harmonize patient consent workflows, allowing us to pull records from any EMR or ROI vendor.

Implementation detail: Perhaps integrating with each API will cover consent. Usually you need to upload a separate authorization validation process such as Power of Attorney, Will, Proof of Guardianship, or Letter of Representation if you're a third party. these will fall outside of the core if the market of non-consented workflows (e.g., TPO, required by subpoena, etc.) is big enough.

Value Proposition: By having a unified submission and retrieval API it will help reduce administrative overhead for submission and provide the backbone for metrics.

Unified and Shared Provider Directory

Problem: Clients struggle to identify the correct copy service companies or facilities handling specific medical record requests. For example, if I want to retrieve my medical record from Cedar Sinai in Marina del Rey I actually I have to reach out to Cedar Sinai Beverly Grove in LA. This leads to an enormous time loss as each request needs to be researched.

Solution: Build a continuously updated database that associates a medical facilities treatment address to their record release address. Features like smart search filters based on location, type of service, or specialty will enhance user experience.

Enable users to contribute and verify facility information

Create a wiki-style system for updating facility contact info and requirements

Value Proposition: Reduce administrative costs in requesting a record

## Identified Data Workflows

Record Locator

Problem: Patients often receive treatment at multiple facilities, and often don’t know where they have been treated. This is a huge problem since Record Retrieval needs a patients medical facility address to know where to route the request.

Solution: Aggregate identified claims data which can then be used identify the treating medical facility associated with any patient record. List of partners in the Appendix

Value Proposition: Reduced gaps and care and allows for the monitoring of a patient's healthcare providers over time, adapting to changes in treatment relationships as they occur.

Identified Data Workflow

Problem: Requestors need a way to reduce the number of records they send for Retrieval. For example, Requests may only want to retrieve records for those that have cancer.

Solution: Partners with identified claims aggregators which can then be used identify patients with a specific condition. The claims aggregator would then flag patients that match to the Requestor.

Value Proposition: Reduce the number of records that need to be retrieved. This saves Requestors money.

## Potential Additional Features

Data Security and Compliance: Ensure compliance with HIPAA and other regulations, coupled with security features like encrypted data transfer, audit trails, and role-based access controls, builds client trust.

Copy Service and Provider Analytics:

Anonymized success rates for different facilities and ROI Companies

Allow users to rate and review ROI vendor performance

Track and share average response times by vendor

Build vendor performance scorecards

Reward vendors who consistently perform well with preferred status

Clinical Data Abstraction: Value Added Services

Problem: Clients like lawyers, insurance companies, researchers, and pharmaceutical firms need more than raw records; they need specific, relevant data. Solution: Partner is a LLM company and Human curation services to extract key medical information from patient records. Custom abstraction templates for different use cases (e.g., clinical trials, litigation) will add value. Document classification and labeling. Value Proposition: Requestors can receive meta-data associated with their m

## Security & Compliance

Security and Compliance is Central to Hermes Health. As such we have developed a robust security framework to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive medical data. Data encryption is a cornerstone of this framework, employing end-to-end encryption for all transmissions and AES-256 encryption for stored data. Access controls are enforced through role-based access controls (RBAC), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and IP-based restrictions, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

Based on what we see in competitors, we want to consider the following certifications in terms of priority:

HIPAA certifications

SOC2

HITRUST

HIPAA Standards

Because medical records will be flowing through our pipes, meeting HIPAA requirements is table stakes. This includes

Secure Sessions & Transmission

Network Protection

Disaster Recovery

Data Backup

Internal & Third-Party Testing & Assessments

Security Monitoring

Record Access Management

File Encryption Policies

System Access Logs

Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

Authentication & IP Restrictions

SOC2 Standards

SOC2 is an audit procedure that ensures secure data management. It relates to IT security and privacy for healthcare and customer record management. SOC 2 compliance demonstrates that the provider has taken steps to protect any confidential or personal data.

SOC 2 Type II Certification is not a one-and-done process. Type II determines the veracity and security of data management procedures based on ongoing internal security practices.

HITRUST

HITRUST certification is part of the long-term roadmap. While not an immediate priority, it represents an additional layer of trust and compliance that will be pursued as Hermes Health continues to scale. HITRUST encompasses comprehensive controls that unify regulatory requirements, setting a gold standard for healthcare data protection. Achieving HITRUST certification will further solidify Hermes Health’s position as a trusted partner in the healthcare industry.

Data Backup and Recovery

# Go To Market Strategy: Target Market & Pricing

## Target Market

Hermes Health Target market will be to monetize Requestors and specifically attorneys, insurance companies, provider analytics companies, digital health and medical companies. Hermes will focus on Operations, Payment, and Patient Authorized workflows.

It will not focus on supporting treatment use cases given the saturation in the market and given he Health Information Exchanges make this market infeasible to monetize given the competitive landscape and current deferral regulations.

Below is a list of each client type within our target market.

Attorneys: Attorneys involved in medical malpractice or injury cases need medical records to build their cases.

Mass Tort

Workers Compensation

Injury

Insurance Companies: For claims and underwriting processes, insurers need to gather medical records efficiently and securely.

Car Insurance

Life Insurance

Provider Analytics Companies: Companies involved in preauthorization, payment, and revenue cycle management need timely access to medical records to make decisions and power their solutions.

Preauthorization

Revenue Cycle Management

Digital Health & Medical Device Companies Reimbursement

Wellness Apps

## Pricing

Hermes Health offers a simple and scalable pricing structure designed to accommodate a wide range of customers, from smaller law firms and independent research groups to large insurance companies and digital health companies.

The pricing model combines a predictable annual platform fee with usage-based charges for specific services, ensuring customers only pay for the features and volume they need.

PassThrough Savings

Hermes Health will negotiate bulk pricing with ROI and EMR vendors and pass significant savings to requestors. For example, Hermes Health estimates it can generate $20 in savings per record, retaining $8 while passing $12 to requestors.

For example for an Attorney making 30,000 records annually, this results in $240,000 retained savings.

## Addressable Market

Today our target market comprises about 25,400,000 medical records being retrieved per year.

Given our target market we estimate an addressable market of $1B.

By targeting high-volume requestors such as attorneys, insurance companies, and digital health organizations, Hermes Health aims to capture a $1B addressable market. The simple, scalable pricing model combined with pass-through savings ensures cost efficiency and high adoption rates, positioning Hermes Health as a leader in the medical record retrieval ecosystem.

Initial Market to Commercialize

Hermes Health will focus on commercializing the Attorney - MassTort market first. This is the market that is has the greatest need for the Hermes Solution:

Lacks technical resources to integrate with ROI and EMR vendors directly

Relies on manual or outsourced processes that are slow and expensive

Has a pressing and immediate need for timely, identified medical records

Offers a clear buying decision-maker and budget availability

Network Effects and Flywheel Effect

Hermes Health's business model leverages strong network effects due to its role as a middleware platform connecting two primary groups: Release of Information (ROI) vendors and Requestors (e.g., attorneys, insurance companies, researchers). Here's how the network effects manifest:

Two-Sided Marketplace: As more Requestors use Hermes Health, the platform becomes more attractive to Vendors because it offers them access to a larger pool of potential clients, increasing their revenue and reducing costs through standardized integrations.

Enhanced Value for Requestors: Conversely, as more Vendors integrate with Hermes Health, Requestors gain access to a broader range of medical data sources through a single, unified interface. This reduces administrative burdens and simplifies the retrieval process.

Increased Data and Service Quality: With a growing number of participants, Hermes Health can collect more data, refine its algorithms, and improve value-added services This enhances the overall user experience, making the platform even more valuable to all users.

Each additional User (whether a Requestor or Vendor) adds value to the platform for all other users, creating a network effect that can accelerate growth and adoption.

Hermes Health's business model is designed to capitalize on network and flywheel effects by creating a platform where the addition of each new user enhances the value for all existing users. This not only accelerates growth but also establishes a robust competitive position in the medical record retrieval market. By focusing on building a comprehensive network of ROI vendors and Requestors and continuously improving the platform's services, Hermes Health can create a powerful, self-sustaining cycle of growth and value creation.

# Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) and Their Limitations

Health Information Exchanges Overview:

Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) facilitate electronic sharing of health information among healthcare organizations, primarily for treatment purposes. However, they have limitations:

Treatment-Centric Focus: HIEs support continuity of care, focusing on treatment and direct patient care. They are not typically used for legal, research, or insurance needs.

Limited Interoperability: Not all healthcare providers participate in HIEs, and variations in data standards hinder effective information exchange.

Data Gaps: HIEs often lack complete data, as not all providers contribute to the exchange, resulting in gaps in patient medical history.

Given their constraints HIE cannot support the use cases pursued by Hermes Health, such as Research, Operations, Individual Access, and Research.

Opportunities for Improvement

This dynamic presents an opportunity for companies like Hermes Health or new entrants to the market to focus on the requester side of the equation. By offering solutions that prioritize both the medical facility and the requester, there is an opportunity to disrupt the market by:

Developing requester-focused interfaces that streamline the submission and tracking of record requests.

Introducing value-added features like status notifications, predictive wait times, digital signatures, and integrated messaging.

Providing enhanced customer support for Requestors, reducing friction points, and making the process as transparent as possible.

An ROI company that can balance compliance and operational efficiency for healthcare facilities while delivering a superior experience for Requestors would be in a strong position to differentiate itself from traditional ROI players, who have historically focused on only one side of the market equation.

By leveraging Hermes Health's comprehensive solutions, requestors can significantly enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve outcomes. Our platform not only streamlines the medical record retrieval process but also empowers organizations with the tools and insights needed to excel in a competitive landscape.
