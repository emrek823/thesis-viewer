## Slide 4: Thesis

**Own the System of Record**
Embedding AI in the system of record has
structural advantages over standalone tools.

**Rollup is the Means, Software is the Outcome**
Rollups create the foundation for software scale: by
acquiring and transforming RCM operators, we gain
distribution, data, and real workflows that compound
into a vertically integrated OS

**RCM is the Transformation Wedge**
We drive near-term margin through automation, and RCM
ownership gives us a captive, profitable customer base to scale
the EHR into.

**Vertical Integration Provides Defensibility**
By combining EHR, RCM, and front-cycle features
into a single vertical OS, we can maintain and improve
margins against existing and new competitors, by
delivering a better product.

The behavioral health EHR market is fragmented with low NPS. SimplePractice serves sole practitioners, while upmarket customers remain underserved. With Epic, Athena, and Cerner absent, a vertical OS can dominate the space.

**Defined Playbook**

**Diagram:** A soccer playbook diagram showing "X"s (defenders) and "O"s (attackers) in a formation, with arrows indicating movement. This is a metaphorical representation.

Epic has shown the criticality of the system of record and the playbook of building AI features on top of the system of record and vertically integrating the RCM. We're running the same playbook in a greenfield market.

**Sources:**
Market opportunity is calculated by the following: EHR market size from Bain Consulting's Project Freud (2022); RCM (~5%) and Front-cycle (~10%) of total services market spend (reflecting industry averages).

## Slide 9: The Wedge: RCM

**Left Panel:**
Large fragmented market, filled with regional players that specialize by geography or therapeutic area. There are ~7000 billing companies, with many clinics that still manage billing in-house.

**Image description:** A workflow diagram showing "Human" interaction with "Manual Process" steps, implying pen-and-paper and manual data entry.

Workflows rely on pen-and-paper and manual data entry.
Manual Process -> Manual Process -> Manual Process -> Manu

**Right Panel:**
**Bar Chart 1: RCM Business Margin Transformation**
*   Initial: 10% EBITDA, Labor is 60% of spend
*   Transformed: 60% EBITDA (with reduced labor)

RCM businesses trade at just 3-7x EBITDA. By acquiring and applying AI to remove labor bottlenecks, we can expand margins from ~10% to ~60%, and gain a captive customer base to cross-sell additional software.

**Bar Chart 2: EBITDA Margin Comparison**
*   **Ease EBITDA Margin:** High (approx. 60%)
*   **Market EBITDA Margin:** Low (approx. 10%)

Owning RCMs beats selling software to them. Our margin expansion advantage makes us the natural category consolidator.

**Sources:**
EBITDA uplift estimates are grounded in historical results achieved by the RPA company we are acquiring.

## Slide 10: Vertical Integration

**Unlocks AI Product Depth**
**Graph:** Cost vs. Features.
*   Shows a rising curve of features, with various AI components at different cost levels: AI A/R, AI Scribe, Prior Auth, AI Admin, AI Claims.
*   **easeOS** is shown encapsulating all these features within a rectangle, suggesting it covers the full range of AI functionalities.

Owning the full stack eliminates integration friction and workflow blindness. We decide what's product vs. commodity.

**Broken Procurement**
**Diagram:** A 4x4 grid of circles, representing different point solutions. A large 'X' mark is overlaid on the grid, symbolizing the difficulty of integrating many disparate systems.

Clinics spend just 1-2% of revenue on software (mostly on EHR/PMS). Point solutions don't fit the budget, and integration chaos blocks adoption.

**Compounding Advantage**
**Graph:** A time-based graph showing growth.
*   **Standard EHR + RCM Stack:** Flat, low growth line.
*   **Standard EHR + Ease RCM:** Gradually rising line, showing moderate growth.
*   **easeOS:** Exponentially rising blue line, demonstrating significant, compounding growth.

New products compound value. Each addition strengthens the whole system.

## Slide 11: Turning Consolidation into Intelligence

**Left Diagram: Migration Paths**
*   **easeOS Migration:** A direct path from "Cut-Over" to "Go Live" (green box), implying a fast, seamless transition.
*   **Traditional Migration:** A longer, more winding path from "Cut-Over" to "Go Live" (grey box), suggesting a slower, more complex process.

Controlling billing removes the biggest EHR switching pain. We migrate clinics seamlessly, turning a barrier into our moat.

**Right Diagram: Ease RCM Automation Engine**
*   **RCM Company (NY) and RCM Company (MD)**
    *   Each has sub-components: "NY", "NJ" and "MD", "MA" respectively.
    *   Each of these has multiple "Payor" boxes underneath.
*   All these components feed into "Observable Labor"
*   "Observable Labor" feeds into "Training Data" (with multiple downward arrows).
*   "Training Data" feeds into the **Ease RCM Automation Engine**.

By acquiring diverse RCM companies, we're assembling a comprehensive training dataset spanning regions, payors, and billing expertise that power the Ease Automation Engine.

## Slide 12: Phase 1

**Automate & Productize RCM**
Expand RCM margins to 60% through automation. Acquire 4-6 firms to prove repeatability across states and payors.

**Cross-Sell EHR & RCM**
Cross-sell RCM to EHR customers and vice versa. Drive higher ACVs and retention.

**Build Private Credit Readiness**
Build to $7-10M EBITDA to access private credit markets.

## Slide 13: Financial Projections

**Line Chart: Total ARR over 7 Years**
*   Year 1: $22.3M
*   Year 2: $52M
*   Year 3: $104M
*   Year 4: $175M
*   Year 5: $281M
*   Year 6: $413.4M
*   Year 7: $585.2M

**Table: EaseOS ARR and RCM ARR Breakdown**

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | Year 6 | Year 7 |
| :---------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| **Total ARR** | $22.3M | $52M | $104M | $175M | $281M | $413.4M | $585.2M |
| **EaseOS ARR** | $11.3M | $29.6M | $57.6M | $105.1M | $182.3M | $279.2M | $407.4M |
| **RCM ARR** | $11M | $22.4M | $46.4M | $69.9M | $98.7M | $134.2M | $177.8M |

## Slide 14

Our model is copy-and-paste: ~80% of the playbook carries over to other
fragmented healthcare markets where providers rely on niche EHRs and
third-party billers

## Slide 21: EHR Cross-sell

**Own the customer**
Acquiring RCMs secures a captive customer base and trusted relationships, creating natural cross-sell paths for EHR.

**Profitable + Patient**
With highly profitable RCMs, we can afford to be patient and strike on cross-sell at the right moment.

**AI-enabled migration**
Using LLMs, we can migrate EHRs in days: build integrations to major BH systems, have customers run them, keep both systems in sync, and let them switch of their old EHR with zero data loss.

**No disruption**
Because we control the billing account that already ties into the EHR, the biggest switching concern is removed, making migration low-risk and appealing.

## Slide 22: Fix the First Mile, Control the Rest

**Manual + Error Prone**
Front-cycle tasks rely on sticky notes, portals, and human input, creating frequent errors and inconsistencies.

**Costly Labor**
Clinics spend 10-15% of revenue on front-desk operations, which are constrained by high staff turnover, limited availability, and one-to-one capacity.

**Clean Source of Truth**
Automation standardizes intake and data capture, ensuring accuracy and eliminating garbage-in/garbage-out problems.

**Scalable AI**
Always-on, multilingual AI handles infinite requests simultaneously at lower cost and higher reliability.

**Downstream Risks**
Intake errors are the leading cause of claim denials, while missed calls translate directly into lost revenue.

**Point Solutions**
Point solutions drive strong results, but without owning the system of record they remain fragile and non-defensible.

**Compounding Moat**
Each automated workflow reduces risk and strengthens the platform, making it harder for competitors to catch up.

**Protected Ecosystem**
Within the walled garden of the EHR, we can ship these features directly and capture the value instead of leaking it.

## Slide 23: Example Workflow: Intake & Verification

**Current Workflow**
1.  Patient submits insurance via phone/email/photo
2.  Admin manually inputs insurance information into EHR
3.  Admin scans card into EHR
4.  ~72 hours prior to visit: Admin manually looks up patient in EHR
5.  Admin finds relevant payer portal
6.  Admin fills out payer specific verification form
7.  Admin calls payer to fill out remaining questions
8.  Admin creates PDF verification form and submits to EHR
9.  Admin confirms verification with patient

**Ease Workflow**
1.  Patient submits insurance via phone/email/photo
2.  Auto-parses information and writes to EHR
3.  Voice agent pre-validates coverage using real-time eligibility check
4.  AI autofills using previous insurance plan verification policy
5.  Voice agent speaks to payer to fill out remaining verifications
6.  AI writes back information to EHR
7.  Admin confirms verification with patient

**Before**
*   30-45 minutes per patient
*   Error-prone
*   Bottlenecked by admin capacity

**After**
*   No HITL (Human In The Loop)
*   Positive downstream effects
*   Infinitely scalable

## Slide 24: Acquisition vs. Zero-to-One

**Distribution & Data Moat**
EHRs and RCMs don't win on product alone but on workflow lock-in and distribution, by acquiring assets we instantly gain hundreds of customers, structured data flows, and the channels to scale new products.

**Economic Efficiency**
RCM companies trade at ~ ½ the multiples of software, so acquiring and transforming them with AI is far cheaper than burning capital to win customers from scratch, while also unlocking cross-sell into their entire customer base.

**Embedded Across Workflows**
Owning an EHR and RCM gives us direct visibility into messy workflows and adoption friction, letting engineers build, test, and deploy solutions in live environments that already have scale.

**Faster Path to Scale**
Starting from scratch would take 5-10 years; with our RCM and EHR we already have millions in revenue and hundreds of customers, accelerating credibility with customers and lenders, unlocking private credit expansion.

## Slide 25: Our Differentiation (amongst other AI rollups)

**Fast-Track Rollup with Platform in Hand**
Most rollups are "slow boil," taking 12-18 months per deal and starting from sub-scale assets; we're different because we already own a scaled platform, with additional assets under LOI that can double EBITDA within weeks of this raise.

**Three-Legged Team Advantage**
Success in this market requires a dealmaker CEO with AI product vision, a world-class CTO who can build and ship in legacy healthcare environments, and a seasoned operator who has scaled EHR and RCM at scale, our founding team uniquely checks all three boxes.

**Software-First Rollup Model**
We're using inorganic acquisition as our go-to-market engine, fusing M&A with proprietary product development to build an AI-native behavioral health operating system, creating a faster, more efficient path to a $5B+ outcome.

**Attract Top-Tier Engineering Talent**
AI rollups often fail to recruit world-class engineers since most avoid private-equity-style rollups, but we've already secured top 1% talent eager to build in this model.

## Slide 26: EHR Technicals

**Well-maintained Cloud-based .NET stack + Desktop app**
SQL server + ASP.net MVC build-out. Analytics, Logging.

**Feature Complete**
We don't need to ship net new features inside the EHR to service the market we're going after

**High up-time and compliant**
99.9% uptime + HIPAA compliant

**Secure**
No security incidents, modern security practices around AuthN + AuthZ
