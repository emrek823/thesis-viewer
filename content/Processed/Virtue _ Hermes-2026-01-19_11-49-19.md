### Current Funding Status

- Total committed capital: $3.7M
	- Family office: $1.8M
	- Shahir: $200K
	- Michael Boxer: $200K
	- TNV: $1.5M (written commitment)
- Maverick pursuing reference call with Jim Lacey (Data Board member)
	- Jim already contacted Shahir
	- Reference call is current gate for Maverick decision

### Active Investor Pipeline

- Flair
	- Asking data room questions about Gorilla Health and Epic
	- Alejandro wrote memo, no response since yesterday
- Outsider Fund (generalist)
	- IC meeting happened Sunday
	- No response yet, reached out to Jillian for follow-up
- Wavemaker
	- IC meeting scheduled in 1 hour from call
- Bessemer (Sophia)
	- Re-engaged after learning about interest/closing timeline
	- Writes small checks, will respond shortly
	- Given data room access
- Tau
	- Talking to Katie to share diligence
	- “Pretty hot” on the deal

### Strategic Considerations

- Round is oversubscribed, providing optionality and leverage
- Institutional investor preference hierarchy:
- TMV shows strong conviction - Emma “chased down” aggressively
- Potential carve-out of ~$200K for Atria
- Not chasing Sequoia follow-up

### Timeline & Next Steps

- Decision timeline: End of this week (Thursday/Friday) to finalize syndicate
- Expected responses from Maverick, Flair, Wavemaker by end of day Tuesday
- Strategy: Let process play out naturally rather than forcing decisions
- Alejandro rejected idea of different pricing tiers for angels vs. funds to avoid complicating existing investor considerations
