### Patrick’s Background & Company Origin

- 20+ years in product development, started at Frog Design (Disney, Chase, 49ers stadium projects)
- 11 years in startup space, mostly digital health
- Head of Design at Omada Health
	- Joined at 100K members, left at 750K members
	- Led product overhaul, rebrand into chronic condition management (diabetes, hypertension, MSK, mental health)
- Brief stint in investment tech at VC (zero-to-one company, 65 people, $500M+ AUM)
- Personal motivation: gaps in post-PT care and supporting parents with multiple chronic conditions
	- Mother has osteoporosis, arthritis, tendinitis, neuropathy - becoming less active
	- “Solved problems” but no navigation support after diagnosis

### Groove Business Model & Market Position

- Started D2C to test and learn, discovered ~50% users had osteoporosis
- Targeting 120M people with undertreated conditions not sent to PT
- Current traction:
	- 24 practices approached, 12 referring patients, converting to contracts
	- 5 patients/week per provider typically
	- Providers generating $5-10K additional revenue
	- CAC: $175 D2C, expecting $100-125 with insurance coverage
- Revenue sharing model with providers billing through their NPI
- RTM codes focus (vs RPM) - less than 1% utilized, CMS lowering thresholds for 2026
- Differentiation: actual movement therapy vs “pinging patients 15 times/month”

### Next Steps & Investment Discussion

- Raising funding to close by end of month
- Growth target: 2,000 patients = $3M+ ARR
- Key scaling challenge: training clinical team to teach AI rather than direct patient care (240:1+ ratios)
- Virtue follow-up process:
	- Internal debrief by Tuesday
	- If proceeding: 60-minute second call with 10 questions
	- Go/no-go decision, then quick diligence process
