“When you work with an industry leader, you get access to the broadest-possible array of tests, capabilities and solutions,” says Rob Dottori, director of private payer and virtual markets at LifeLabs. “With technology changing so quickly, you need a testing partner who continues to innovate every day. But you also want a partner who is established enough to have earned the trust of communities and providers, with a proven track record of reproducibility and precision in its testing.”

Here are the top three ways the right diagnostic laboratory partner can facilitate clinical trial success:

1. Streamline and Increase recruitment

As medicine becomes more personalized, recruiting and enrolling qualified clinical trial participants is increasingly challenging. Without access to a sufficiently large and diverse patient population, the study won’t deliver scientifically rigorous, generalizable findings that satisfy regulators—if it can be completed at all. As many as 20% of cancer trials fail due to lack of enrollment.

2. Ensure data integrity

Not only should your diagnostic testing partner have a thorough understanding of all relevant federal and provincial data security, privacy and quality assurance standards, but they should also conduct regular internal audits and process reviews to ensure ongoing compliance.

3. Maintain stakeholder trust

“Our oversight helps ensure every process supports accuracy, patient safety and trusted results,” says Phillip Morehouse, director of quality and regulatory affairs at LifeLabs. “Every result we deliver is a testament to the quality of our work and the dedication of our teams. We’re proud that our commitment to excellence and continuous improvement across the entire organization ensures results that Canadians can trust.”
