### Company Updates: What’s Working

- Doctronic: Too risky for most clients currently
- Counsel: Seeing traction with pharma contracts
- Lucem: Major breakthrough after multiple pivots
	- Hit inflection point - scaling 10 to 50 clinics by H1 next year
	- 20-50M ARR, cash flow positive for 2 years
	- iRhythm partnership driving success and validation

### Lucem’s Business Model Deep Dive

- Core offering: AI chart review in EHR for patient finding
	- Sole customer: pharma companies
	- Free for health systems if using own rules/logic
	- Royalty model activates when pharma pays for data access
- Go-to-market strategy:
	- Started with iRhythm (AFIB risk identification)
	- Deployed across 20 sites, scaling to all locations
	- Health systems co-create patient outreach workflows
- Competitive advantage:
	- Not tech differentiation - commoditized AI
	- Cracked go-to-market motion that competitors haven’t
	- Clear pharma focus vs trying to “do everything”

### Health System Value Proposition

- Initial hook: Solve existing problems for free
	- Patient activation challenges
	- Screening/targeting difficulties
	- Quality and business objective support
- Revenue sharing: Health systems earn from pharma partnerships
	- Incentive to scale - more clinics = more revenue
	- Predictable cost structure for pharma clients

### Other Companies Discussed

- RX Assistant:
	- Founded in high school, sold to Galileo for ~$5M
	- Now building holdco structure with multiple businesses
	- Real patient engagement (20+ min interactions)
	- Partnering with pharma for specialty pharmacy workflows
- Atropos: Has potential but lacks dedicated patient finding product
- Adia/Fearless Ventures:
	- Alex-led integrated lab/EHR/AI platform
	- Self-funded model, difficult to invest in

### Regulatory Opportunity: PDURS

- New FDA classification: Prescription Drug Utilization Related Software
	- Extends drug brand life by several years if co-filed
	- Massive value creation (example: 2 years × $500M drug = $1B)
	- Live for 2 years but limited examples due to regulatory timeline
- Implementation challenges:
	- Requires congressional/regulatory expertise
	- Can’t retrofit to late-stage companies
	- Need early-stage partnerships for wraparound services
