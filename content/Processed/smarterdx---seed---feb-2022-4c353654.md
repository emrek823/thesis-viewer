## Slide 2: SmarterDx Mission Statement

SmarterDx systematically identifies errors in physician documentation that cause lost hospital revenue and lower quality rankings.

## Slide 3: The Problem with Medical Codes

Medical codes underpin all $1.2 Trillion hospital spending in the US, and they are wrong 10% of the time.

The #1 cause of incorrect medical codes is that doctors don't write everything down. Hospitals employ nurses to fix this, but they can't identify all the gaps because existing software solutions force them to manually review every detail in every chart.

## Slide 4: Consequences of Documentation Gaps

The inability to fix these documentation gaps results in:

$20 billion in lost revenue for hospitals each year and lost future revenue due to poor quality ratings.

## Slide 5: HOW IT WORKS

SmarterDx helps hospital reviewers identify all opportunities across all charts by transforming slow manual searches into a fast 'agree' or 'disagree' reaction.

## Slide 6: COMPETITION

Incumbent players 3M, Iodine add value by prioritizing some charts over others, but still task reviewers with sifting through the entire chart

**Their value prop:**
You still spend 20 minutes per chart, but we tell you which ones are highest yield.

**Smarter Dx** (logo)

**Our value prop:**
Spend just 2 minutes per chart, and get through all of them.
