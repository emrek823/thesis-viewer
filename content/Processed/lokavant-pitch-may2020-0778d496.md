## Slide 1: Lokavant
Lokavant
A Paradigm Shift in Clinical Trial Intelligence

## Slide 2: Clinical trials are now big data problems

**More trial complexity**

**Chart: % of studies requiring major rewrite of protocol**
*   23% (No label for what this refers to, but likely percentage of studies with major rewrites based on the next bullet point)
*   77% of studies: Require major rewrite of protocol (4 per study)

**Source:** 1 Tufts CSDD

**More data**

**Chart: Datapoints in 2010 vs 2020**
*   **2010:** 1.2M datapoints
*   **2020:** 3.6M datapoints

**Source:** 1 Tufts CSDD

**Text:**
3x increase in study design complexity¹
3x more data in late-stage trials¹

**More siloing**

**Chart: Hundreds of point solutions and vendors, fragmented by geography therapeutic area, and use cases²**
(This section displays a large number of company logos and categories of solutions for clinical trials. I will list the categories and some representative companies for each, as extracting all would be impractical and not fit typical markdown table format.)

## Slide 3: Why now? The need for intelligent clin ops has never been greater

**Chart: # of registered clinical trials¹**
*   **X-axis:** Year (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022)
*   **Y-axis:** # of registered clinical trials (50k to 400k)

**Data Points (approximate from graph):**
*   2010: ~80k
*   2012: ~110k
*   2014: ~140k
*   2016: ~190k
*   2018: ~240k
*   2020: ~300k
*   2022: ~360k

**Source:** 1 CT.gov

**Key Reasons:**

*   **Continued explosion of new trials** (in niche therapeutic areas)
*   **COVID accelerated decentralized methods**—dozens of new systems launched since 2020
*   **Clinical operator burnout is at an all-time high (>55%)** and growing

## Slide 4: Lokavant’s end-to-end clinical trial intelligence platform

**Core platform**

*   **Single source of truth**
    *   Ingest, standardize, and aggregate data whenever it sits in real-time
*   **Deep data repository**
    *   Run predictive analytics using historical and in-trial data

**Connected Intelligence**

*   **RBM/Risk monitoring**
    *   Identify and mitigate emerging risks in your study operations
*   **Milestone tracking**
    *   Early insights to see if your study is on plan from startup to closeout
*   **Enrollment forecasting**
    *   Update enrollment plans in real-time and react to changes before they happen (In dev)
*   **Medical monitoring**
    *   Identify and mitigate emerging risks in your clinical data (In dev)

## Slide 5: Lokavant makes clinical operators more effective with less effort

**"Best in class" study management**

*   **Reactive:** What happened last week or month in my study
*   **Siloed:** Insights limited to one system, team, or trial
*   **Reconciliation:** Work across 6 to 12 systems and spreadsheets
*   **Heuristic:** study plan is wrong 80% of the time; 2-4 major in-flight changes

**Lokavant**

*   **Proactive:** what will happen next based on historical / in-trial data
*   **Seamless:** use any system or vendor, see data in a standard way
*   **Real-time:** 3 clicks to go from study-, site-, to patient-level
*   **Data + Heuristics:** Study plan 70x more accurate and adjusts in real-time

## Slide 6: Companies and executives love our impact...

**Impact from first deployments (sample)**

*   **Proactive:** Identified critical issues 8 months earlier (rescued study)
*   **Seamless:** Harmonized 300+ systems 12x faster than plan (weeks vs. years)
*   **Real-time:** ~15% reduction in effort by eliminating reconciliation (>30 FTEs)
*   **Accurate:** 70x improvement in enrollment forecast (MAPE)

**Quote:**
“Lokavant was able to...uncover insights that we had never seen before. These insights have [already] helped enable better time, cost, and quality outcomes.”

EVP Clinical Operations
(largest trial operator in Japan)
