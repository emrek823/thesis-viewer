### Deal Context

- First deal Brenton is leading and joining board at Lightspeed
- Breaking rules to win this deal - only other institutional investor besides InsurTech
- Planning $500k investment
- Only need minimal clinical diligence and market research

### Investment Strategy

- Comfortable at inception stage with hands-on partnership
- Roll-up strategy transitioning from seed to growth private equity
- Plan to deploy $100-500M over time
- Initial approach:
	- First acquisition out of gate (CD)
	- Build proof of concept technology
	- Get AI team in place
	- Larger round to finance additional brokerage acquisitions

### Growth & Value Creation Thesis

- Two core drivers:
	- EBITDA margin uplift through:
		- Top line growth (accessing more members)
		- Bottom line efficiencies (AI-enabled)
	- Platform multiple arbitrage
- Strategy viability:
	- State-based approach
	- Large pool of mom & pop targets
	- Multiple segments (Individual, Commercial, Medicare Advantage)
	- Buy EBITDA at low multiples + expand margins + higher exit multiple

### Team Building Requirements

Three key priorities:

- CTO hire:
	- Must be AI native/expert
	- Leveraging Google DeepMind talent network
	- General CTO recruiter engaged
- Internal M&A capabilities:
	- Initially leveraging Will’s network
	- Need dedicated team for scaling acquisitions
- Product proof of concept:
	- Voice AI capabilities
	- Member reach expansion
	- Early metrics validation

### PE Resources & Support

- Growth/PE team led by Isaac:
	- 8-10 person team (growing daily)
	- Strong buyout and M&A experience
	- Background from Elliott (12 take-privates)
- Support areas:
	- Local presence in Austin
	- Personal guidance/mentorship
	- Network access for advisors/angels
	- Launch team support (PEO, company formation)

### Next Round Planning

- Lightspeed committed to $10M+ follow-on
- Bigger challenge will be scaling execution:
	- Finding right assets
	- Tech implementation
	- Margin improvement
- Could become marquee portfolio company
- Potential for $30-50M+ future investments, up to $150-200M for large assets

### Strategic Considerations

- Keeping updates terse/stealthy due to competitive concerns (GC)
- Planning “coming out” announcement after first acquisition
- Timing announcement with follow-on round to maximize equity value for M&A
