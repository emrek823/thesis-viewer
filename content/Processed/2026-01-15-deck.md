Genomic Intelligence Built to Stop Hospital Infections Before They Spread

Private and Confidential

## Slide 2: Hospital Acquired Infections are a $45Bn Problem, Impacting 1 in 31 Patients

Hospital Acquired Infections (HAIs) worsen patient outcomes and cost hospitals billions – but are exceptionally challenging to avoid, detect, and manage

**High Costs from Hospital Infections**
1 in 31 U.S. hospital patients has an HAI daily and cost $28-45Bn per year (1,2)

**Outbreaks are Increasing**
Drug-resistant superbugs (CPEs) are up 69% and Candida auris up nearly nine-fold in recent years (3,4)

**Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is Surging**
1 in 7 U.S. lab-tested infections are resistant, driving 35k deaths and $5Bn in costs per year (5,6)

**Prevention Teams Are in the Dark**
Data gaps mask where infections start and which interventions will work best

**Compliance Erodes Margins**
CMS cuts, readmission penalties, and accreditation demands squeeze resources

**Legacy Tools Aren't Keeping Up**
Clinical testing and culture workflows can take up to 3 days, causing action to lag spread (7)

## Slide 3: Claryx Removes the Structural Barriers to Proactive Surveillance

Proactive, room-level surveillance is now possible. COVID showed the power of early warning, and we can now build a "digital twin" of the hospital microbiome to catch threats before they cause harm

**BLOCKER #1**
**Proactive Sequencing Was Too Expensive**
High sequencing costs limited use to retrospective analysis and outbreak response, not continuous surveillance

**BLOCKER #2**
**Infection Prevention Is Resource Constrained**
Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) is treated as a cost center, forced to be reactive and do the best with what they have

**THE CLARYX UNLOCK**
Proprietary chemistry cuts enrichment costs 20-fold, vertical integration enables same-day PCR turnaround

**What This Enables**
Claryx transforms IPC from cost center to AI-enabled proactive value driver, detecting signals up to 8 days before patients show symptoms (1,2)
*   Same-Day Pathogen Alerts
*   Pinpoint Outbreak Sources
*   Real-Time AMR Tracking

## Slide 5: How It Works

Claryx is fully vertically integrated, handling all aspects from sample collection to results output, with negligible involvement from the hospital

**1 Sample (9am pickup)**
*   Daily air (ward) and wastewater (basement). Weekly clinical isolates (1). Monthly surface and drain swabs (treatment rooms)
*   No patient swabs. No PHI.

**2 Analyze (10am drop-off)**
*   Claryx courier to central Claryx lab. Daily PCR for 25+ targets. Weekly genomic sequencing
*   Proprietary reagents enable scale.

**3 Alert (3pm PCR Results)**
*   Dashboard flags threats within 24 hours. Maps reservoirs. Enables IPC with targeted interventions confirmed by patient infections
*   Same-day actionable intelligence.

**What We Detect**
*   **Bacterial Threats**
    *   ESKAPEE Pathogens (2), C. diff
*   **Viral Threats**
    *   Flu, COVID, RSV, Norovirus
*   **Fungal Threats**
    *   Candida auris, Aspergillus
*   **Resistance Genes**
    *   mecA, KPC, NDM, OXA-48

**(1)** A clinical isolate is a bacteria or fungus grown from a patient specimen in the hospital clinical microbiology lab; it's already separated from the patient and carries no PHI, and after routine testing it's typically discarded.
**(2)** The ESKAPEE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species and E. coli) are recognized as the leading drivers of multidrug-resistant hospital infections and account for the majority of healthcare-associated infections (Emerging Microbes & Infections).

## Slide 9: How Infections Hit Hospital Margins Across All Reimbursement Models

Prevention may not be reimbursed, but infections still directly impact hospital economics

| | Claryx Purchase Barrier | Path to Adoption | Economic Wedge |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| | Payers reimburse many infections but **don't cover prevention**, so adopting Claryx is a direct hospital cost | Hospitals still absorb major infection costs: Never Events, penalties, and lost bed days that hit the P&L | +50% of Never-Event infections, which carry no reimbursement, are caused by ESKAPEE pathogens (1) |

**Economic Wedge in Action**

**Reducing Infections Unlocks Three Universal Levers:**
*   Unreimbursed Costs
*   Freed Patient Days
*   Shorter Excess LoS (2)

**Regardless of Reimbursement Model:**
*   Capitated
*   Fixed Payment (DRG)
*   Fee for Service

**Quantifying these three levers in a 526-bed academic hospital yields ~$10mm of incremental operating income (see next slide)**

**(1)** The ESKAPEE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species and E. coli) are recognized as the leading drivers of multidrug-resistant hospital infections and account for the majority of healthcare-associated infections (Emerging Microbes & Infections). CMS and other payers do not reimburse for designated "Never Events" (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services).
**(2)** Length of Stay. Average LoS at a 526-bed academic system is 6.4 days (Association of American Medical Colleges) while patients who contracted an ESKAPEE infection had an excess LoS of 10.7 days (Journal of Hospital Infection).

## Slide 11: $3Bn Hospital Opportunity, Starting in NYC to Validate, Then Scale

Hospitals uniquely enable linkage of environmental signals to confirmed disease, creating proof points that support expansion into adjacent settings

**Initial Market Capture (1)**
*   $10mm Claryx Benefit
*   × 0.3x Size Adj. (526 → 153 Bed Avg.)
*   × 20% Capture (Assumes 5x ROI)
*   = $0.6mm Claryx ACV
*   × 5,112 Community Hospitals
*   = $3Bn SAM

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**
*   **$3Bn** U.S. Community Hospitals Market Sizing

**NYC Launch Market**
*   96 hospitals within 45 minutes of Claryx lab

**Total US Only Market (Pie Chart Data):**
| Segment             | Value              | Percentage (Derived) |
|:--------------------|:-------------------|:---------------------|
| U.S. Only Hospitals | $24Bn (Largest)    | ~67%                 |
| Offices             | $11Bn              | ~31%                 |
| Education           | $2Bn               | ~6%                  |
| Manufacturing       | $7Bn               | ~20%                 |
| Other (2)           | $1Bn               | ~3%                  |

*Note: Percentages sum to more than 100% indicating that categories might not be mutually exclusive or the sum of market segments for the entire SAM is larger than the single $24Bn "U.S. Only" slice implies it should be. The $24Bn likely represents the largest single segment and other values are additional market opportunities.*

**(1)** Hospital pricing is anchored in value capture (~$10mm incremental operating income), which implies an annual Claryx cost of ~$0.6mm, or 0.23% of average net patient revenue ($243mm). We use this implied "insurance rate" to size adjacent verticals, applying a conservative 0.10% of sector revenues. This framework mirrors how other risk-mitigation categories price (e.g., cybersecurity at ~0.69% of revenue). Full SAM calculations and backup available upon request.
**(2)** Includes Hotels, Skilled Nursing, Jails/Prisons, Military and Elder Care end markets.
**Note:** Analysis excludes entertainment venues (performing arts, theme parks), cruise ships, shelters, airports, transportation assets, warehousing and freight, agriculture, utilities, retail and food service, construction, and other facility-based operations.

## Slide 16: Use Case Snapshot

By turning unit-level infection signals into prompt action, Claryx enables earlier containment of pathogens, targeted cleanup of reservoirs, and focused protection for high-risk patients

*(Graph showing "Signal" vs "Time" with "Clinical Cases Confirmed" increasing over time, and illustrating "Standard Intervention" occurring later than "Early Claryx-Enabled Intervention" leading to fewer cases.)*

**Outbreak Containment** (emergency only)
*   All decisions remain with IPC
*   Claryx simply provides data to support them

**Diagnostic Guidance** (if warranted)
*   Targeted Symptom Monitoring
*   Risk-Based Follow-Up Screening

**Environmental Controls**
*   Enhanced PPE
*   Enhanced Disinfection
*   HEPA Filters
*   Contact Precautions
*   Vaccinations/Boosters

**Illustrative Use Cases**
1.  New MRSA patient isolate matches another from a prior room occupant, prompting room/reservoir disinfection
2.  New *Pseudomonas* clinical isolate detected in sink, flags room reservoir, enabling preemptive disinfection
3.  Airborne *Candida auris* detected in a ward, triggers early diagnostics, sanitization and HEPA/UV-C controls

**Real World Validation (1)**
At UPMC Presbyterian, two years of sequencing clinical isolates uncovered 172 outbreaks spanning 476 patients. Transmission routes were identified in 121 cases, and 109 (96%) were contained along their identified route

## Slide 17: How Hospital Economics Really Work for Infections

Claryx delivers value across reimbursement models, with varying degrees of attribution

|                     | Clean Attribution                                  | Claryx Benefit                                   | Fragmented Attribution                                 |

| **Reimbursement Model** | Capitated <br> (Kaiser, Safety Net, ACOs)          | Fixed Payment (DRG) <br> (Majority of US Care)   | Fee for Service <br> (Commercial / Non-Delegated)      |
| **Revenue Model**   | Fixed Budget: Set payment <br> per patient or member | Capped per Case: Flat fee <br> (e.g. $20k) regardless of cost | Per Service: Itemized billing, <br> subject to denials |
| **Infection Impact** | Pure Loss: Every infection <br> dollar burns surplus | Cost Absorption: Hospital <br> eats 100% of cost overruns | Non-Payment: "Never Events" <br> are denied, beds are blocked |
| **Reimbursement Model** | Direct Operational Loss                            | Direct Margin Destruction                        | Revenue Loss + Blocked Beds                            |
