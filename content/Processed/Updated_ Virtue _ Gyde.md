### Operational Challenges & Technology Focus

- Biggest execution risks identified:
- Technology team restructure:
	- Pod structure with dedicated data/ETL pipeline team
	- Focus on “insurance chaos” data intake layer as competitive moat
	- Manual workarounds initially, then elegant integration solutions
	- Balance immediate migration vs. gradual transition approaches

### M&A Strategy & Market Positioning

- Barbell acquisition approach targeting two segments:
- Market focus shift to Medicare Advantage:
	- Believes MA businesses mispriced at current trough
	- Staying away from ACA except existing portfolio company
	- Avid acquisition will serve as proof of concept
- Target pace: Multiple deals per quarter through 2026
- Financing update:
	- Next round anticipated H1 2027: $150-200M hybrid (70% debt, 30% equity)
	- UHG wire still pending post-JPM week
	- Company announcement planned January 28th with NASDAQ billboard
- Team scaling to 30-35 people by year-end (excluding acquired company employees)
