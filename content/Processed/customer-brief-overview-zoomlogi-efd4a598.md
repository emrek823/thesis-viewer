Intro

ZoomLogi, Inc. is on a mission to transform Visibility within Pharma logistics by preventing temperature-controlled logistics failures through real-time data aggregation, predictive recommendations, and rapid intervention. $35B worth of Pharma shipments go to waste annually due to failures in the temperature-controlled logistics process. These failures are preventable, if addressed proactively. The Pharma supply chain is among the most demanding in logistics, and our software solution is purpose-built to meet these challenges head-on, providing visibility across temperature excursions, communication gaps, chain-of-custody failures, and more.

ZoomLogi’s Platform

ZoomLogi helps healthcare companies, and logistics teams in particular, have full visibility on all critical shipments at all times, through a simple and intuitive dashboard that pulls data across all available sources (such as TMSs / ERPs, loggers, fleet telematics, LSP APIs/Websites, external databases, AI check calls, …) that acts as a single source of truth. By standardizing data across several providers, and augmenting it with AI and predictive insights, the platform helps surface high risk shipments that might require intervention. No more pen & paper/excel, check calls, and toggling between portals or outdated internal systems to keep track of shipments.

In addition to helping logistics teams save money from avoided shipment failures, ZoomLogi helps these teams become more efficient by standardizing performance metrics across all LSPs (Logistics Service Providers), and making it easy to customize scorecard KPIs, and Targets, as well as providing auto-updated key contact details (leveraging data/calls from all users across the platform). No more rush at the end of the quarter, stitching data from different providers (with different KPI definitions) to figure out which provider performed better from a Quality, Speed, Cost, Quantity standpoint.

ZoomLogi’s software can also be used to review location failure points (airports, warehouses, ports, …), and access up-to-date related operating hours and key contacts. (e.g. who has the key to warehouse A at LAX). Saving hrs on phone / email per week wasted due to outdated contact details (game of telephone)

The software solution can be complemented by our own logistics experts (aka sentinels), that have deep industry experience, and are equipped to intervene if necessary, to further prevent logistics failures. This helps our customers avoid the cost and hassle of staffing up a large operational team, and adds yet another layer of protection for these high value shipments.
