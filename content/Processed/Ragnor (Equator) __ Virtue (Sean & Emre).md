### Background & Experience

- Started coding at age 12, built and sold ERP system to car dealership
- Sold company to German publisher during high school
- Completed AI and CS undergraduate degree
- Masters in biotech from Cambridge
- Joined QBio (Andreessen-backed) in San Francisco as first data scientist
	- Built clinical data infrastructure for ingesting patient data (MRIs, blood panels)
	- Developed internal medical knowledge graph for making inferences
- Conducted protein design research at Francis Crick Institute using transformer models
- Worked at Flagship Pioneering on venture creation intelligence team
- Consulted for AstraZeneca and Bay Area biotechs on data infrastructure and ML
- Built strong conviction in infrastructure thesis through pharma value chain exposure

### Product Vision & Strategy

- Building AI-native Veeva alternative focused on knowledge infrastructure
- Core focus on structuring unstructured data from clinical trials and PubMed
- Two key differentiators:
	- Systems of record and action: Centralizing knowledge into searchable source of truth
	- Problem solving: Writing information back to systems to drive decisions
- Initial focus on Medical Affairs:
	- Sits at center of value chain (connects commercial, market access, regulatory, R&D)
	- Targeting global medical director executive level
	- Currently using Excel/OneNote - opportunity to upgrade workflow
	- Not directly competing with Veeva initially
	- Plan to trickle down from executive level

### Technical Infrastructure

- Built FDA-compliant system with audit trails for LLM changes
- Custom data models for CRM and entity tracking
- LLM-native architecture allowing:
	- Branching off data structures
	- Suggesting updates for human review
	- Voice interaction capability (validated by BioNTech CCO)
- KOL data approach:
	- Treating as complementary to system of record
	- Commoditizing data layer through LLM automation
	- Reducing reliance on manual curation (vs Veeva Link’s 4000 curators)
	- Integration with external data sources (FDA, clinical trials)

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Partnering with consultancy serving top 10 pharma companies
- Developing direct founder-led sales motion
- Creating executive AI council with top pharma representatives
- Leveraging similar approach to Attio for data enrichment

### Funding Status

- Initial angel investment from Charlie
- Raised $2.5M total
- Current valuation: $15M cap
- Point Nine Capital led round (previous Attio investors)
- Limited space remaining in round
- Timing has been challenging with slow responses
