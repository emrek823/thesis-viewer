**A: I oversee the budget for utilization management.**

**Client**
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about utilization management. Can you share a brief overview of your background and the company that you work for now?

**Expert**
Sure, I can give a quick background about the company. We're a big New York-based company having 2.8 million members right now. We're a close to a big chunk of Medicaid population, about 50%, 60% and the rest we have Medicare and some commercial healthcare line of business, heavily based out of New York, Florida and New Jersey.

From the product standpoint, we have different products that we have today. We're using HealthEdge for CAP solution. Also, for the core admin piece of solution HealthEdge and we have utilization management. We have quite a few products. Some of them we're using is like HealthEdge, GuidingCare, and Optum as one of the solution with some of the other services that we are using today.

**Client**
Okay. You're using HealthEdge for your UM and you're also using Optum. Are there other solutions that you use for either prior authorization or medical necessity review that are specialty specific?

**Expert**
Yes, we're using HealthEdge, the GuidingCare for the prior authorization, Optum, and we have a little bit of Medecision for a very small niche line of business that we're using for AI-powered solutions that we're using today. Heavy on HealthEdge, GuidingCare that is being utilized and developed for the past two years right now, for the improved quality of care and the reduced administration burden.

**Client**
Appreciate that background. It sounds like you have three core vendors, HealthEdge GuidingCare, Optum and Medecision. Is that all the vendors that you have focused on? I know HealthEdge, GuidingCare is a little bit more focused on care management but it sounds like they also do UM. Optum, I'm assuming you're using InterQual and then Medecision, it sounds like is more specialty UM.

**Expert**
Yeah. That's what we are using that today. Like I said, we have a mix of three but we would like to converge that over the next six months. Top six months. Over the period of 18 months to 24 months, we want to converge into one platform down the road for better pricing and a better utilization as one platform.

**Client**
Makes sense. Before we jump into these third-party solutions, can you talk about in house the number of nurses that you have focus specifically on utilization management, not including care management? What the budget is for this department?

**Expert**
For the nurses within the utilization management or just across the board?

**Client**
The nurses focused on UM not across the board.

**Expert**
Yeah. We have the budget close to roughly about seven figures budget annually that is defined. That is scaling up more around the revenue based on the full-time crown, the salary, benefits, and also some of the training and continuing education, all those things. There is a lot of process that we look at. We have, I would say, about seven figures as per one of the Medicaid line of business that we're using them today to begin with.

**Client**
Okay. Seven figures is focused on nurses for UM. How many nurses would that be? Is it safe to say an average salary of like $85,000 or do you know the actual?

**Expert**
Yeah, about $85,000-$90,000, $95,000 in that range model, roughly.

**Client**
Okay. Let's say, it's $90,000. That would be like 33 nurses.

**Expert**
Yeah. Thirty, 35. In that range.

**Client**
That's to cover how many lives? That's covering the entire population or is that just Medicaid?

**Expert**
Just the Medicaid population. We might scale up depending upon the budget and the other funding that comes in. That is just for certain line of business right now that we're using them today.

**Client**
Okay. What about your UM for Medicare? Do you have Medicare lives?

**Expert**
We have it, but that has been outsourced today. We don't use it internally. It's been outsourced to a different company. Right now, Medicare is something that we're doing internally. Like I said, we want to convert this over the next 18-24 months to bring a lot of work in house full time. It's part of the journey right now. We wanted to try it out, test it out and see the value of the business solution. If everything looks good, we'll try to bring more in house as a solution for the next 24 months-range journey.

**Client**
Makes sense. Who is the Medicare UM being outsourced to? Is that multiple vendors or one vendor?

**Expert**
It's been outsourced to a third party. I think one vendor right now, and that vendor takes care of the whole logistics of the operation, training, all the other services, everything as part of the vendor management process.

**Client**
Okay. I'm going to dig a little bit more here. Who is that vendor and do you know how many nurses they have that are focused specifically on you or on your plan? What's your budget? How much do you pay them per year?

**Expert**
I think it's more around a flat fee, eight figures that range because it goes up and down. We have a bigger chunk of population. That is being scaled, and we wanted to utilize that over the period of 12-18 months. We want basically test it out every year and see the value and do the KPI metrics and see the overall value proposition of how this works as part of the overall function. We do it yearly and check the overall vendor evaluation after every 18 months' time frame.

**Client**
Makes sense. Do you use the same vendor every year and who is the vendor that you use?

**Expert**
Vendor was third party. It's been there for a while. We've been using the same vendor. I don't recall the vendor name. We've been using that vendor for quite a number of years for the operational model. We would like to bring them back into our full time going forward the next 2026 time frame.

**Client**
Okay. If I listed off a couple of potential vendors, would you think that you would be able to remember or you don't think that's possible?

**Expert**
Sure.

**Client**
The potential vendor might be Carelon. Are they the vendor that you use, or no?

**Expert**
No.

**Client**
Okay. How about Evolent?

**Expert**
Yes. They are one of the vendors we have used.

**Client**
Do you think they're the core vendor that you're using for this? They're focused specifically on oncology. Are you using multiple vendors for Medicare or is it just Evolent, do you think?

**Expert**
I think there are multiple vendors. It's just not one because there are multiple scenarios that we're using it. I don't focus in that part of the business because I work more around the internal line of business to support all the operations, streamlining and getting all the work done through the logistics.

From the vendor's aspect, I don't have the exact name or we might be using multiple vendors. I'm not sure in that space. There are better like Cotiviti also can play a role because I believe Cotiviti had done some work in the space. I believe Cognizant and TriZetto, they also had something. They were supporting us, one of the vendors in the outsourcing model. I think they have merged as one company. TriZetto was acquired by Cognizant. They provide end-to-end UM and claim support today.

**Client**
That makes sense. Given that you're not entirely focused on that, I'm going to try to pivot some of the questions to the in-house solution. Last thing here, do you know what guys are paying some of these vendors that we've talked about? Evolent or Cognizant or HealthEdge or the others that we mentioned? Do the PMPM pricing models?

**Expert**
We're paying about per member per month depending upon the work and the workload and the use cases. We're trying to do a percentage of savings, about 15%-25% of cost savings annually. There are different models that you can use like a flat fee or PMPM. I think PMPM works out better over the period of two to three years if you try to mark up in the range of three years' time frame.

**Client**
Got you. Do you know what they are for the specific vendors though? What the PMPM is for HealthEdge for example?

**Expert**
HealthEdge would be more on the price. We're paying monthly right now.

**Client**
What do they provide for you? Care management and utilization management?

**Expert**
Right. They also have some work in the space of the CAP solution. They also have a core admin solution that we're using today.

**Client**
The care CAP closure at solution.

**Expert**
They're big in that space and that was one of the main reasons we purchased a product. It helped us looking at some of the work in the pricing, sourcing and the CAP solution.

**Client**
Makes sense. How about Optum? What are you primarily using them for?

**Expert**
We're paying Optum today for the Optum utilization management.

**Client**
Okay. Is that for InterQual that you're paying them?

**Expert**
Yes. That's InterQual we're using today. We're using them for some of the work in the prior authorization solution and also some of the work for evidence-based criteria and some of the AI-driven review automation process such as InterQual and auto review process. They have some good functions around the efficiency and accuracy around the AI-driven medical review automation.

**Client**
Makes sense. Before I jump to the next vendor, do you the number of patients? Is this for the entire patient population that you guys are paying for HealthEdge and Optum, or is that just for Medicaid or Medicare? The whole population?

**Expert**
For which one? For the HealthEdge or for the Optum?

**Client**
We can go one by one. How about HealthEdge?

**Expert**
HealthEdge, we started with a high level one line of business because it has a tightly integration with the CAP solution and the core admin. We used one line of business to support that. We are just paying for Medicaid as one area to support that line of business.

**Client**
Okay. I just want to make sure I have this right. How many Medicaid lives would you say are in that contract?

**Expert**
One million lives in that line of business.

**Client**
All right. Would it be safe to say that it's anywhere in eight figures that you're paying HealthEdge on a yearly basis for those solutions?

**Expert**
Yes. Since we tried to do a multi-year discount plus, we also bought other products along with what we have today. We try to get some additional cost savings with that product line of business with HealthEdge.

**Client**
Makes sense. How about for Optum, is Optum being used across the whole population or just Medicaid?

**Expert**
Just for Medicare right now. That's only a smaller chunk. We're just testing it down and see how that is working out. If there's more business value and more cost savings and business efficiency, we would like to continue in that direction. It's more of a pilot test phase. The next three to six months by Q3, we'll make the decision whether we want to continue in that direction or we want to bring them in house. We're just testing it out for the next two overall solutions.

**Client**
Makes sense. How many lives do you have in Medicare?

**Expert**
Close to about 800,000, that range. That's the range we have right now. We're not doing all in one shot. We're taking a high-study, high-risk population and working in those scenarios and see how that works out. We're taking a high, medium, high, low and medium type of risk population and just phasing it out and see that is working properly or not.

**Client**
Got you. How many lives do you think are in that contract right now of the 800,000 that are the high-risk lives?

**Expert**
I would say 30%-40%, that range. That is close to that range we're looking at right now. 250,000-300,000, that range, we have population.

**Client**
All right. Just to make sure that I have the math right, it's probably, let's say, it's 300,000. It's going to be an eight figure contract there. Something like that?

**Expert**
Around that, yeah.

**Client**
Okay. Can you just remind me what they're doing for you? You said InterQual so that's like inpatient medical necessity and are you using Change for your claims clearinghouse with them. I think you mentioned prior authorizations but can you just explain exactly what Optum is doing for these high-risk lives?

**Expert**
Especially with the chronic situation and some of the heavy treatment with the clinical guidelines, we need this prior authorization which is a built-in process. They have some good business capability function that's already working and has been utilized in that diabetes type of treatment as an example.

They have that process built in which will take care of submitting the prior authorization and helps inpatient notification online because that helps to streamline all the processes using the reliance on fax submissions. It also helps to enable faster decision-making process. They also have a solid evidence-based criteria which is based on the clinical best practicing guidelines. They have an integration with a program that will help to collect all the data and provide the right level of information in a timely manner.

They have a good evidence-based criteria as one of the models and they also have a newer model. I think we just started utilizing that more around medical review automation process. More AI driven which can help to improve the accuracy of decision-making process. That's something we're looking at and that has to reduce

some of the unnecessary utilization and optimize resource allocation in terms of managing the cost.

**Client**
Makes sense. I've heard about that. For the two that you mentioned, HealthEdge and Optum, do they have nurses that they've assigned to you and how many nurses do you think that they have?

**Expert**
You are looking for an approximate number or just around how many nurses do you work directly or do you work with one point of contact to get all the contracts established?

**Client**
Yeah. Typically, they'll assign a certain number of nurses that are focused on this UM for a health plan. It might be 20 or 30 or 40. I don't know exactly what the number is.

**Expert**
Right now, about 40-45 range that we have today and we wanted to see how we can scale up and scale down, or maybe we want to rotate some of the nurses based on different types of utilization. Roughly, we have 45 that we're using today.

**Client**
Okay. I'm just a little confused. Before you said that you have 30-35 that are focused on the Medicaid population for UM. Are these 40-45 that you're mentioning now the same as those nurses or are these different nurses from HealthEdge or from Optum?

**Expert**
These are the same nurses like I said, because this could be more of scaling up depending upon the load and the work that is being assigned. The range would be around 35-40 range. Again, if the work is more on the higher side we will try to scale up. We have more like the nurse manager with more one point of contact and they provide that level of details information. We have about 35-40 that range.

**Client**
Okay. Just to clarify, because Optum's doing. They're focused on the Medicare line. You said the budget for these 35-40 was just focused on Medicaid. Are there other nurses that you guys have in house that are focused on Medicare or are all those nurses coming from Optum?

**Expert**
All those nurses are coming from Optum right now for the Medicare.

**Client**
Okay. How many do you think there are focused then on Medicare specifically outside of the 30-35 that are focused on Medicaid?

**Expert**
You mean to say from Optum?

**Client**
Yeah.

**Expert**
That would not be a big chunk. Like I said, we're trying to grow that unit internally within the company and that population is still not there yet. We don't have the right level of expertise and the training that is required to be provided within the company. We're relying heavily on Optum to support that.

**Client**
Do you know how many nurses Optum has assigned to you for that line of business?

**Expert**
It's not a big number. That is a smaller chunk that we're using them today, but I don't have the exact number that we're using from Optum's standpoint.

**Client**
If you could guess how many do you think you would say they have?

**Expert**
Because it's a smaller chunk of population, I would say roughly about 15. In that range.

**Client**
Makes sense. That would align with what I understand. I think that's a fair number of lives. The last vendor that I want to pick your brain on is Medecision. I'm going to run through the same questions for them now. What are you guys paying them on a PMPM basis if you know?

**Expert**
It's a similar range, but the thing is their workload is very specialized for a certain type of business. We're using them close to $6 or $7 in that range. One of the main reasons we like the product is they have good predictive advanced analytics features.

They have orchestrated around the cost management and some of the engagement strategies across clinical care continuum and decision-making process. They have some good features in that. We're using for a very specialized type of business function of Medicision. It's not a bigger chunk. We're paying close to about $6-$7 per month.

**Client**
Okay. Just to say that back, they're doing basically predictive analytics to help with cost management and engagement. It sounds like they're largely used for care management. Do they do any utilization management for you?

**Expert**
I think they're also heavy on the automation process. For example, if you want to automate some of the manual tasks to expedite the response times. They have a good automation and workflow orchestration optimization process. If you want to align some of the workflow across various lines of business and proactively monitor and manage some of the compliant obligation solution, they have some good features in that space. They have some good value that they are providing today. That's one of the reasons we wanted to utilize them.

**Client**
That makes sense. You said their automation around prior authorization. Is that what you said? I couldn't hear that exactly.

**Expert**
Automation around the overall workflow process. For example, if you want to expedite the response time you can actually automate some of the manual tasks today and decrease the administrative burdens in that space.

**Client**
Is that for utilization though? Is that when a prior authorization is being requested, when they're doing the medical necessity review?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
Got you. What's the use case there? Is that a specialty like condition-specific use case? Who are the lives that they are focused on?

**Expert**
They have very special needs scenarios, very conditional-based use cases. The population is not huge to support them. We're using for a very specific type of health conditions with some chronic situations. For those kind of situation we're using them today, specialty need patients.

**Client**
Do you know what the conditions are? Is it like a specific like cardiology or radiology or MSK or is it something else? You said chronic conditions. There's a lot of chronic conditions, so I'm just trying to understand.

**Expert**
It's more around the heart situations, that is something I've seen and some chronic situations which we're trying to grow in that space. We have seen, especially in heart situations and those chronic failures, that type of problems we've seen a lot, but we are finding out more utilization of the product.

**Client**
Makes sense. Are those patients Medicare, Medicaid or commercial?

**Expert**
That is more commercial right now because that is a new line of business we started about few years ago. We're scaling up and we're finding out there's a growth in that commercial line of business. That's where we're trying to add more value. We want to grow that business more around strategically and also want to scale up different specialty.

**Client**
Makes sense. How many lives do you think are in that contract?

**Expert**
Because it's a new business, we're close to about 200,000. That range. That is the range we're looking at right now.

**Client**
Okay. I think I got what I needed on that decision. I would say it's 200,000 lives in that contract. That's an eight figure annual contract for them. Does that sound about right?

**Expert**
Yeah.

**Client**
Great. It would be helpful if you remember the businesses you're using for the other Medicare lives that are being outsourced beyond Optum. It sounds like you mentioned Evolent and Cognizant, which acquired TriZetto, and that you're paying in total for that budget. You said eight figures. Is that right?

**Expert**
Yes. Around that range that we're paying them today.

**Client**
Okay. My last question for Medecision, do you know how many nurses they have focused on your plan in that contract?

**Expert**
We have close to about 20-25 in that range we have today that's been contracted.

**Client**
Great. Have we covered all of the third-party solutions that you guys are using and that are outside of the in-house 35-40 Medicaid nurses at this point?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
I know that can be a bit of a weird exercise to go through, so I appreciate that. That gives me a lot of helpful understanding.

What are your thoughts on how AI can impact medical necessity review? I'm curious about the concept of using AI to provide concise summaries of latest research, for example on a drug or a procedure's effectiveness based on the specific patient condition and EHR data.

If they don't have enough data that the provider submits, sending that back via a questionnaire through the prior authorization API to get that EHR data that is needed to understand exactly what an effective drug or procedure would look like and have very patient-specific approaches to that. Is that something that makes sense to you? I'm trying to wrap my head around that.

**Expert**
That's a good way to look at from the problem statement and trying to come to a solution on the problem. At the same time, you also need to look at how you can automate some of the clinical data extraction through AI process because there are a lot of data that comes through different channels such as EHR like lab results, physician notes and some of the imaging reports.

If you can automate some of the extraction of the data through this unstructured data that can help to reduce the manual touch points and also helps to speed up the review process. We're also trying to do that like automation and extraction of the clinical data, which I think is one of the most important thing that will help to overall optimize the data cleansing and enrichment of the data.

The next one would be more around focusing on the real time prior authorization because most products they are trying to do that. Especially, if you have the health plan guidelines which is defined properly. It can help to facilitate more like a near real-time prior authorization decisions. There are a couple of values that you can do. One is helps to improve patient satisfaction and reduces delays in the patient care.

That is something I can see more value like automation of the data extraction, real-time prior authorization and that will help to enable some of the risk stratification which is if the patient is planning to stay more in the hospital, that can help to reduce patient outcomes, predict patient outcomes, for example, the length of hospital stay or likelihood of readmission. Those things can be changed based on these scenarios.

I think that is something that you should be focusing around with all these different data that are being collected. At the same time, you should also look at integration with the clinical guidelines. A lot of companies are pushing the medical necessity criteria for evidence-based decision-making process. All those things can be automated and integrated with the clinical guidelines. If you have these three, four areas that you can tightly couple and make it more automated with, well orchestration solution, you can see a lot of value and benefit and all the product.

That makes sense. To try to dive a little bit deeper into that last one you talked about, I view this as two elements which are, the extraction of patient data, normalization or cleansing of that data, and specifically unstructured data elements which might otherwise not be readily captured in EHR data. Having a mode of transferring that data specifically through the prior authorization system or API and having that to compare against what type of data is required for a given medical necessity.

The other area I heard you say is actually integrating into the clinical guidelines. Obviously, you mentioned how that would help with real-time prior authorization and I think that makes sense. To what extent is there potential for automating the utilization management nurse line of business? Let's say, it's a specialty condition like oncology or cardiology or radiology, if your nurse is required to consistently use their judgment in gray areas, how would you think about automating that side of things or applying AI to help the nurse with more subjective judgments or clinical judgments that they need to make?

**Expert**
To me that would be some level of training and education that needs to be provided because there's a lot of expertise that goes into this type of solution. If you're trying to bring any new members or any new nurses to support this type of platform, you got to have that level of expertise. How you can drive some of these tools with all these features and capabilities around the product.

There's a learning curve how this can be done. At the same time, if you utilize the right level of members with the right level of caliber or potential, you can utilize the same members to do multiple things in more efficient way. That's something that I've seen. It all comes with training and education and there should be a self-awareness type of education that has to be given to the team to take it forward as a next step.

All this technology and all these changes keeps evolving and you have to be ready with all these different types of enablers that keeps coming up in the market. You have to be ready what these new changes comes in. You have to be ready with the data integration, the API integration, the clinical guidelines, the decision-making process, the predictive models. There's a lot of tools and technology that is available in the market.

Somebody has to keep an eye on that, bring the right level of expertise and also play with the right level of automation process and try to enable that. That's the way I look at because the solution keeps evolving and you can take small, more like a pilot process and test it out and see how it works end to end.

**Client**
That shows the real value that you can mid-size population to a larger population. You can play a molecular test area with some small set of population and see how that works. Training, expertise and the skills are really important along with this technology and the tools that is out there in the market.

What is your thought about having AI lead a clinical decision support system? Rather than having the UM manager just work within clinical decision support, which is based on these clinical guidelines or criteria sets and having them maybe have access to a specialty-specific set of guidelines.

What do you think about having rule-based AI that is able to very quickly read through that EHR data and then spotlight what the literature is. The relevant literature that needs to be reviewed, or the guidelines that are out there from some of these colleges or research groups. Surfacing that for nurses to better enable them to prioritize what elements of the guidelines they need to be focused on?

**Expert**
I feel like whenever we talk about any AI-based solution, I think the first thing we should look at is what are we trying to do with AI-based solution? Are we trying to predict future events like less hospitalization, readmission or solving complication or disease progression type of solution? You got to take those use cases and build the story around that because every use case has different types of capabilities and functions that you can solve.

The way I was talking about the first thing is the data aggregation and normalization, which is one of the main focus, where you can ingest the data, collect it, normalize it and make it very standard of information

so it becomes much easier to make the decision-making process. Similarly, when you have the data available, you should focus more around streamlining the approval process, which is how do we reduce errors in judgment? How do we predict the right next best action to be taken based on the data that is available?

How do we optimize some of the streamlining of the workflow automation process? Those things. How do we enable some of the proactive interventions and personalized care plans? Those things can be done in multiple levels. The first level, which is the right level of data at the right level in a timely manner to the right people or to the right members to look at the information.

Second one is reducing the optimized, improving the optimizer and reducing the in the gap in terms of care and care management, those things. The third one would be more around putting the predictive risk modeling, especially understanding the complication or disease progression or hospitalization, how that can be impacted, so you can proactively intervene and personalize some of the care plan.

Those things that can be done, but everything, it's like a different phase approach if you try to do Big Bang, it's not going to work. There's an incremental approach across different areas and see how you can improve these values, the data, the services, predictive modeling and the guidelines around the clinical matching process, which is InterQual, MCG, NCC, and those things, CMS. If you get all those four pieces together and you try to take one step at a time and see the value that you can see, then you can see the benefit out of that.

**Client**
Makes a lot of sense. On this point, how do you think the buying behavior of a health plan would be and how much would a health plan like yours want to actually pay for software like this that could do that versus retaining the services function that is currently around?

How would you price a software solution that could, let's just say you had one million lives you were able to cover and these were Medicare lives, let's just say like what Optum is doing right now for you guys. How would you think about pricing if you could say, "Reduce the number of nurses that are required to be focused on this by 50% or something like that." Would you be willing to pay the same that you're paying to Optum, more or less because there's fewer nurses? How do you think about that?

**Expert**
Ultimately, it boils down to two things, efficiency and cost savings. That's what we try to bring in and also improve the health outcomes of the members. Ultimately, when we put all these pieces together, you should put KPIs around. What are the success metrics and what are the KPIs that you want to measure across each of these solutions? When you try to bring around these KPIs, which I feel like operational efficiency, which is the main focus and the next one is the quality and compliance, how do we financially impact in terms of cost savings across different features?

What happens is when you do all these things together and you try to do cost savings, you also need to make sure that the provider and the member experience KPIs is also done the right way. It's also growing. For example, the provider satisfaction score, the member experience score, those things also need to be actually going up. You got to put all those things together.

I feel like start with the KPIs around operational efficiency KPIs, which is for example, one of the cases would be a turnaround time, how much time it takes to process prior authorization or clinical review. That's one of the examples. You got to take that as an example. Similarly, look at the quality and compliance KPIs which is what is the denial accuracy rate. How about the overturn rate on those things? We got to put those KPIs together and then work across member experience and provider experience and show the value around the staffing and productivity of the nurse.

If you tie all those things together and you can see with having an outsourced nurse versus a full-time nurse, how much is the real value in terms of full-time benefits versus outsourcing that third party or not having a full-time. You can actually take those values in terms of dissatisfaction and the productivity KPIs. You can put all the things together.

Definitely makes sense. Do you think that there would be a strong willingness to outsource? If so, would it be specialty specific or would it be based on a line of business? How do you think about that? It sounds like you guys are outsourcing for your Medicare population to Evolent on oncology. You're outsourcing for commercial lives to Medecision on more chronic conditions in cardiology.

These are more specialty conditions versus what InterQual might be really good at, which is inpatient. Do you think that's right? You think you'd be more willing to outsource for a specific specialty? That's the way to develop a contract with a payer like yourself?

**Expert**
That's the big issue. If it is a high-volume business, you should try to in-house it, start small and scale up. If you are looking for a very specialty which is low volume, you would like to outsource that to specialty outsourcing companies because they come with expertise and the talent and the skills. You want to outsource that part of the business completely to the outsourcing vendor or outsourcing company.

If any regulation changes happen or any risk changes happen, you are not obligated to take care of that situation. They take care of the whole end-to-end decision-making process. I feel that specialty type of things can be outsourced, but if it's a high volume, low risk and low to medium risk of population that you can take care of, you can bring that into in-house.

At the same time, you can also see if you are trying to grow your business. For example, if your commercial business is growing over the period of three months to two years or six months to two years, and you would try to see outside versus in-house and if the outside is not showing much of value, then you can start gradually increase in-house members and see how that scales up over the period of six months to one year. If that is showing real value, you can scale up through that. To me, specialty has to be outsourced. That would not be a good decision to bring anything in-house into the company.

**Client**
This has been super helpful. How do you guys think about co-development partners? A partner that might help with or what would otherwise be insourced for you and developing your own UM automation systems or systems that are used by your own UM nurses versus outsourcing that to other nurses. How do you think about co-development? Is that something that you guys would be open to, or no?

**Expert**
Yes, we would definitely like to be open for that type of business. When we do this level of business with an in house versus outsourcing, one of the main focus is how much of customization can be handled? How much of scalability challenges will we have? For example, if you are rapidly growing the new line of business, sometimes it becomes difficult to scale up internally. It is better to do an outsourced type of model.

At the same time with the recruitment and retention I have seen, there is always a burnout with the staffing shortages and ongoing challenges. That is also something you got to keep an eye on because with a lot of work, with a lot of members, health outcomes or members being taken care of by the nurses, the burnout rate is very high. You will see a continuous, ongoing challenges with the staff shortages. That is something that has to be looked into with the right level of expertise and skills.
