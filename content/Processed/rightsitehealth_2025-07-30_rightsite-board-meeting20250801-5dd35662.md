## Slide 3: Good Stuff and Stuff

**Good Stuff and Stuff**

### Good Stuff

Our focus for the remainder of 2025 is on achieving positive unit economics. This depends on three drivers: closing case rate contracts, scaling EMS call volume, and continuing to reduce the Care Team cost of care. We've made measurable progress on each front:

**Case Rate Contracts**
Several key payers, including United, Aetna, Cigna, and BCBS-TX, have made significant progress in the sales cycle. We attribute this progress to: (1) shifting to unit-based analysis rather than total dollar savings, which reduces the lift for MEU and actuarial teams; (2) using our growing EMS pipeline as leverage, making clear that without contracts we will need to send those members to the ER; (3) refocusing payer contracting conversations from national to state-level teams who we've seen move more quickly; and (4) engaging Havarti, our actuarial consultant, to strengthen our financial case including third-party validation.

**EMS Call Volume**
Our EMS pipeline has expanded rapidly in Texas, Georgia, and Florida. RightSite's reputation as a trusted partner is accelerating agency adoption. A growing number of EMS deals are coming from our competitor Tele911.

This growing call volume growth is not only ahead of forecast, but it is proving effective in creating credibility and urgency in payer contracting discussions.

### Good Stuff (cont.)

**Care Team Cost**
We're seeing encouraging trends in reducing per-episode costs. Targeted process refinements from time-and-motion studies, staffing schedule strategies with physicians, and more selective use of resources like rideshare, urgent care and prescription assistance, have lowered costs. We are more carefully allocating resources to patients covered by contracts while limiting spend on patients not covered by contracts. We expect Q3 to demonstrate further improvements in cost, and have set a long-term goal: can we ultimately deliver a full episode of care at or below our FFS reimbursement rate?

## Slide 4: Good Stuff and Stuff

**Good Stuff and Stuff**

### Stuff

**Payer Contracting Delays**
Despite the payer pipeline progress, we still need signed case rate contracts.

**EMS Account Management**
EMS sales and activation are currently outpacing our ability to staff and support the field. We are actively recruiting additional account manager coverage, but we are operating below what is needed to support existing demand.

**Care Team Cost**
The more we solve for Care Team cost reduction, the more opportunities we see to reduce it further. We have work to do here.

Our physician licensing and credentialing process is still inefficient, delaying collections (we have to retro-bill), and complicating physician scheduling as we work to align physician coverage with payer eligibility/credentialing.

**Engineering**
To maintain platform stability, we have deferred or slowed several feature releases, including analytics dashboards and navigator workflow tools. While this preserves core functionality, it limits our ability to drive additional cost-per-episode reductions and creates risk of operational drag in future quarters. Our first new engineer in two years joins the current team of three next week.

## Slide 8: Payor Update

**Payor Update**

### What Happened

**Sales Strategy**
*   We now use “Avoidable Units" analysis in sales and account management to speed up MEU and value review cycles, and more easily show value across all payer departments.
*   Havarti (actuarial consultant) completed 2024 CMS data analysis to provide actuarial validation of RightSite's financial analytics and third-party endorsement for program performance.
*   We built a model showing payors our EMS forecast call volume growth, and the plan savings that future volume will generate. This helps overcome cost-of-care hurdles with current low volume, and creates urgency by showing that, at projected volume, RightSite can't keep treating members without compensation and will need to send them to the ER.
*   We're engaging Delegated Providers to speed sales. For example, we are in a later stage with Equality Health, which holds full-risk for 400,000 United and Centene lives, and co-presenting to Centene leadership in August.

**Sales Team**
*   Alex Forystek, Director of Health Plan Partnerships, is now 120+ days in, and his high volume of "at-bats" is starting to shorten sales cycles.

**Investor Help**
*   Multiple networking efforts underway by our investors with Aetna, Centene, Cigna, HCSC/TX Blue, Oscar and United.

### What's Next

*   We're extending Havarti's actuarial engagement to maintain third-party credibility and speed MEU cycles with better insights into helping that group make faster decisions.
*   We continue working with delegated providers like Optum and Equality Health as an alternative to direct payer contracting.
*   The Georgia Medicaid award protest should resolve in Q3, unlocking signed LOIs with United and Humana.
*   To overcome getting "lost at corporate", we are engaging state leadership at major health plans, including Aetna and United.
*   We're testing alternate revenue streams (e.g., bonuses for Quality Measures and Program Referrals) with the Equality Health/Superior Health collaboration.
*   We continue to work on our Walk-In service line pilot to launch and test this important product line extension.

### Challenges

*   Weak plan earnings and poor value-based results are making payers wary of new providers and models. Scrutiny of innovative programs is higher than ever.
*   Health plan-wide lack of actuarial bandwidth continues to slow sales cycles by rushing analyses, which leads to inaccurate projections and the need to help plans rework their analyses.
*   Health plan leadership turnover continues, including the recent loss of another Aetna contracting lead at the state level with whom we had made significant progress.

## Slide 11: EMS Call Volume / Payer Strategy

**EMS Call Volume / Payer Strategy**

This slide shows how we use our growing pipeline of EMS call volume as leverage to speed up contracting with payors.
On the left, we show them a map of our expanding EMS network. The unit analysis on the right shows the financial impact.
In just three metro areas (SAT, ATL, JAX), we've already diverted $4.3M in avoidable ED cost for United. Once we implement the EMS network shown on the map, that loss avoidance jumps to $182M.
We make the case that without a contract, RightSite simply can't afford to continue to care for their members without getting paid as this new EMS call volume comes online, and we'll be forced to forward the members on to the ER.

*   Decision on EMS leadership expected; SAFD Chief under consideration for full-time role

### Challenges

**Payer Timing Mismatch with EMS Volume Growth**
*   EMS volume growth outpacing payer contract effective dates.

**Florida EMS Growth Bottleneck**
*   Florida is our least developed payer market because we prioritized Georgia and Texas. But payer interest is picking up, so we're accelerating EMS sales and starting the search for a Florida EMS account manager.

## Slide 14: Government Relations

**Government Relations**

### What Happened

*   Engagement with Ballard Partners has been fruitful, and we met with the Secretary of AHCA (FL Medicaid) and the Deputy Secretary of Department of Health (all EMS and health systems) in late June. The problem we solve is well known to both, required no education, and we delivered additional, detailed analysis by Managed Medicaid, FFS, and Exchange LOBs, as requested.
*   The DOH Deputy Secretary is a practicing ER physician and has been advocating for a Treat-no-Transport fee for EMS statewide. He has just completed an actuarial analysis for AHCA, and we are obviously an advocate for such a payment scheme.
*   We are awaiting a follow-up meeting with AHCA to review our analysis showing that a RightSite solution would save **$943M** for Managed Medicaid and **$546M** for FFS Medicaid, annually.

The Big Beautiful Bill's healthcare provisions align well with RightSite's strengths as the most cost-effective solution for the increasing number of low-acuity 911 calls. The BBB will increase uninsured patient flow, and pressure on the healthcare and EMS systems will rise:
*   Hospitals will face revenue losses, leading to staffing shortages and longer EMS wall times
*   Medicaid and ACA changes will push more patients to use the ER for primary care
*   911 calls will increase, straining ambulance crews and increasing response times, without matching budget growth
*   The $50B Rural Health Transformation Fund (RHTF) could offer a path to expand RightSite's role in state Medicaid programs.

### What's Next

*   Meet with States on the RightSite/RHTF opportunity
*   Meet with FL AHCA to review analysis
*   Discussions with FL Deputy Secretary of DOH
*   Discussion with Chris Jones at HHS

### Challenges

*   Typical Government Relations activities uncertainty of outcome and timing

## Slide 18: Care Team Operations

**Care Team Operations**

### What Happened

The Care Team has two jobs: (1) deliver on our Brand Promise of being a trusted partner for Patients, EMS, and Plans, and (2) relentlessly lower the cost of providing high-quality care. Here's how we did:

**Operational Metrics**
*   **Staffing & Productivity:** Physicians now average 4.0 activations/hour, up from 2.0, while maintaining service standards. Call volume surges across most shifts are stretching current capacity.
*   **QA & Training:** Navigator QA reviews at 10% of all calls and physician QA at 5%, with bi-weekly coaching and feedback. New navigators receive frequent individual coaching, and existing staff receive monthly coaching. Weekly trainings reinforce process standardization and Motivational Interviewing skills.
*   **Employee Engagement:** New shift staffing schedules for Navigator, and a redesigned Care Team office space are strengthening culture and collaboration.

**Lowering Care Cost**
*   **Process Improvements:** Launched ActivTrak to track Care Team time & motion productivity in detail and in real time, helping Navigators and management understand how they are using their time and finding new efficiencies. We also expanded the High Support Team to handle more follow-ups so the front-line Navigators can process more time-sensitive intakes.

### Lowering Care Cost (cont.)

*   **Resource Allocation Grid:** Stopped follow-up for patients who went to the ER, cutting navigator time, reducing return trip rideshare use, and reducing liability exposure.
*   **Navigator Specialization:** Rolled out Coaching and Training Navigators to drive consistency, improve QA scores, and reduce turnover. We are also experimenting with separating workflow between intake navigators and follow-up navigators for efficiency.
*   **Revenue Cycle:** Added an Insurance Specialist to boost eligibility capture, in-network UCC, collect SSNs, and increase claims submission speed. Rolled out improved transport protocols to reduce cost and improve coordination.

**Organization and Process Changes**
*   **Clinical Leadership:** Natasha Demehri, MD promoted to CMO.
*   **Scaling for Growth:** Updated physician contracts to reduce RightSite liability. Shifted coverage hours and staffing models to better align with EMS call volume growth and surges.
*   **Care Team-EMS A/M Sync:** The Care Team and EMS Account Managers are now connected in real-time to quickly resolve issues as they arise and accelerate account manager response to our EMS agencies.

## Slide 19: Care Team Operations

**Care Team Operations**

### What's Next

**Cost Reduction**
1.  Evaluate RN support for faster e-prescribing and physician triage.
2.  Evaluating whether to discontinue audio-only calls to reduce claim denials and improve diversion success rate.
3.  FTE physicians now serve as second-line surge backup to avoid the high cost of bringing in a tertiary doctor when call volume spikes and we need two primaries.

**Operational Efficiency**
1.  Upgrading RightSite Connect.
2.  Launching a new surge shift staffing plan.
3.  Adding episode reviews.
4.  Piloting virtual Navigator roles for PM shift only where recruiting is harder and cost is higher
5.  Implementing unified scheduling for Navigators and Physicians.

**Community Resource Guide (CRG)**
Deploying an improved guide and maintenance process for faster clinical and social referrals.

**Hiring & Onboarding**
Care Team hiring to match growing EMS call volume.

### Challenges

**Licensing & Credentialing**
Complex, unpredictable multi-state rules continue to slow physician onboarding, despite urgent staffing needs.

**Overview and MD&A**

### Overview and MD&A

Net revenue came in $8.9K below forecast due to higher reserves. SG&A was again under forecast, driven by slower hiring.

We finalized Texas case rate terms with Molina, effective July 15. Other forecasted payor start dates remain our best estimate.

Patient care costs fell for the second straight month, reflecting tighter management of Care Team compensation and more precise delivery of services based on insurance coverage and patient disposition (e.g., transportation, redirection to urgent care). We're onboarding Navigators carefully ahead of new EMS launches in Fort Worth (DFW) and Gwinnett County (ATL).

In Q3, we'll pilot the use of nurse extenders to offload time-consuming Care Team tasks, like prescription processing, which should increase physician and navigator capacity and reduce the cost per episode.

### MD&A

**June Snapshot**
*   Activations ended the month slightly above forecast, driven by higher call volume in Texas. Our new EMS partner in Beaumont is performing well, and SAFD came in ahead of expectations.
*   Diversions ended the month higher by 5% due to a higher diversion rate in Texas.

**July Snapshot** - Instituted a capacity model to support accelerated new volume and inform the remainder of 2025 go-live scheduling.
*   **Georgia** - We continue to expand ATL MSA coverage. Gwinnett and Cherokee Counties are still in contracting, targeting Q4 launches. Dougherty County Fire (Albany), has scheduled go live August and Columbus Dispatch has slotted October.
*   **Texas** - Fort Worth Fire goes live in mid-August with a newly instituted volume-ramp implementation to support an estimated 80/day Several DFW EMS agencies are following their lead including Dallas Fire, Garland Fire, Carrollton Fire driving DFW metro saturation.

### MD&A

In June 628 (66%) of Telehealth Calls included known insurance coverage. Of the the 628, we were able to bill 458 FFS + Case Rate episodes (“Submitted for Billing”), or 73%.

*   115 claims (18%) were in the “No Current Contract” category, a slight increase to May (16%). Top plans in this group were:
    *   Cigna: 38 (33%)
    *   Oscar: 32 (28%)
    *   Humana TX: 15 (13%)
*   One physician still in credentialing accounted for 68% of the "Physician Not Effective” claims (25 total). We're focused on finalizing effective dates and tightening staffing schedules to reduce credentialing-related billing gaps. In the meantime, we're leveraging locum tenens rules to allow new physicians to bill under their predecessor to maintain continuity and revenue capture.
*   We may get retro effective dates for some case rate contract negotiations, but that is payor dependent.
*   Uninsured/Unknown/Other made up 34% of telehealth calls, in line with prior months. We're resubmitting these claims after month-end and recovering insurance coverage for about 10%, which we then bill. Starting in August, we'll partner with PointCare (an 8VC introduction) to support retroactive enrollment for uninsured patients.

### MD&A

A lower mix of patients with contracted RightSite coverage drove a shortfall in billable claims, resulting in a negative variance.

**FFS Claims**
Claim volume missed forecast: Medicaid 52 claims (-28%), Medicare 36 claims (-19%), Commercial 29 claims (-19%)
*   In Georgia, the shortfall was broadly spread across the payors
*   In Texas, total volume was in line with forecast

**Case Rate Claims**
*   Most of the negative variance was due to Georgia (20) with Humana, CareSource, and Centene being the primary drivers
*   Texas case rates were close to forecast (negative variance of 6), with Community First the driver
