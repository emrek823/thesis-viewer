### Team Background

- Emily: MIT graduate, worked at Apple on product design (iPads/MacBooks); became caregiver for grandparents in Bay Area which sparked interest in healthcare tech; Stanford MBA
- Yutong: Healthcare career focused on global public health; helped Uganda’s Ministry of Health build data infrastructure; McKinsey healthcare practice for 3 years; Stanford epidemiology degree; published in JAMA and AJM
- Neil: AI specialist with 5+ years experience since Stanford; expertise across full tech stack - from training models to data pipelines and infrastructure scaling

### Key Learnings & Evolution

- Initially focused on caregiving space and care gaps
- Attempted caregiver marketplace model but faced challenges:
	- High need but low willingness to pay
	- Distribution challenging through local networks
	- Caregivers (often immigrants) resistant to platform due to tax/audit concerns
- Pivoted to provider-side approach after finding:
	- Greater willingness to experiment with AI/tech
	- Opportunity to improve operations
	- Potential to drive new revenue
- Market trends supporting AI adoption:
	- Healthcare organizations shifting budgets from labor to AI
	- Even organizations on 1% margins increasing tech spending
	- Growing acceptance of ambient scribe solutions

### Current Partnerships & Traction
