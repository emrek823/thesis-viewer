How does a best-in-class engineering organization build a medical device from scratch?

Meta’s Reality Labs embedded quality directly into existing workflows so engineers could spend more time coding and less time on documentation.

Hear Lucas Fernandez, Director of Medical Devices at Meta, explain how they did it so teams of any size can borrow the playbook. 👉 [**Register here**](https://www.ketryx.com/learn/webinars/register/how-meta-preserves-a-best-in-class-engineering-culture-in-a-regulated-environment?utm_source=healthcareaiguy&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=live-meta-webinar) to join live or receive the recording.

**OpenAI's state of enterprise AI in healthcare**

OpenAI just released its first State of Enterprise AI report, drawing on real usage data from more than one million workplace accounts. AI is clearly no longer experimental at work. Across industries, employees sent 30% more messages year over year, while token usage per company jumped 320x as reasoning models moved into real products. About 75% of workers said ChatGPT improved the speed or quality of their work, and the same share reported doing tasks they could not do before.

Healthcare stands out in the report. It was the second fastest growing sector for ChatGPT adoption, with usage up 8x in the past year, trailing only tech. Clinicians and health system staff are using AI to summarize notes, draft documentation, navigate guidelines, and support research. Power users report saving hours each week. It is encouraging to see healthcare leading the pack as AI reshapes workflows, reduces administrative drag, and expands what care teams can handle day to day.

**OpenEvidence doubles valuation as revenue surges**

OpenEvidence, The chatGPT for clinicians, is back in the spotlight after reports that it is raising $250M at a $12B valuation. That would double its valuation from a $6B Series C closed just two months ago, which itself followed a $210M Series B at $3.5B earlier this year. The growth and velocity is striking. OpenEvidence is now generating more than $150M a year in revenue from just ads, with fewer than one million users and roughly 90% gross margins even after compute costs. That puts it in rare territory among AI application companies crossing both $10B valuation and $100M-plus revenue. It also seems that 2026 will be the year AI ads cross the rubicon.

The new funding is expected to accelerate R&D, especially around multimodal capabilities, while building on recent milestones like its licensing deal with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the launch of a HIPAA-secure Dialer. The bigger signal may be business model driven. OpenEvidence shows that AI-native healthcare apps can scale extremely quickly, monetize through ads, and still meet clinical and privacy standards.

**3/**

**How safe are today’s models in clinical use?**

A new Stanford and Harvard study takes a hard look at how safe today’s AI models really are in clinical use and the results are more nuanced than the headlines suggest. Researchers evaluated 31 LLMs on 100 real outpatient eConsult cases across 10 specialties, generating nearly 13,000 expert annotations. These were not routine visits but clinical gray zones where primary care doctors were already asking specialists for help.

The findings are sobering. Even top models produced 12 to 15 harms per 100 cases, while weaker models exceeded 40. Most harm came from omission, meaning AI failed to recommend a critical test or follow up rather than suggesting something overtly dangerous. In many cases, the best models slightly outperformed physicians, while average performance was similar.

The key takeaway is not that AI is unsafe, but that “mostly right” systems can be risky in edge cases. Measuring harm directly, not just accuracy, is becoming essential as clinical AI scales. ([link](https://bench.arise-ai.org/))
