### Private Equity Market Dynamics

- Lower middle market PE activity picking up significantly
	- First half of year was bleak, now seeing substantial deal flow
	- Nimish comes in mid-way through IOI and stays through final diligence
	- Enterprise values typically 100-300M range
- Target companies emerging from market correction
	- Vintage 2019-2020 fundraises now at market
	- Transparent PBMs, PBM claims tech companies, prescriber insights platforms
	- Service businesses hitting revenue thresholds for PE interest
	- Mix of founder-led provider service networks (never took venture) and VC-backed companies seeking exits
- Corp dev teams have strong acquisition opportunities currently
	- Companies of relevant size available for strategic buyers
	- Many compelling assets won’t achieve venture-scale exits in current form

### Healthcare AI Market Consolidation

- Pop health sector as case study for market dynamics
	- Innovaccer - positioned as generational/transformational company
		- Substantial funding to achieve ambitious vision
		- Playing for large-scale exit opportunity
	- Arcadia - founder Mike Nucci secured PE deal
		- ~$500M market value transaction with Nordic Capital
		- “OK economics” for founder after years of effort
		- Nordic likely merging with Inovalon
	- Azara Health - Insight Partners acquisition
		- Founders did well due to significant cap table ownership
		- Insight playing niche strategy, not transformational scale
- Merger activity increasing among similar-stage companies
	- “Mergers of equals” between complementary platforms
	- Example: pharma-focused company + payer/employer-focused platform
	- Strategy to double top line and repackage for better exit in 18-24 months

### AI Implementation in Healthcare Operations

- Payer AI adoption lagging behind other healthcare sectors
	- Menlo survey showed payers least enthusiastic about AI adoption
	- Alternative health plan models utilizing AI gaining traction
	- Payers prefer exclusive partnerships rather than multi-payer solutions
- Operational AI impact emerging
	- USHV with Valerie Health: 50% reduction in intake personnel
	- Copilots insufficient for unit economics transformation - integration required
	- Agentic AI revolution not yet realized in payer operations
- Human-in-the-loop model prevalent
	- Most AI deployments augment rather than replace workers
	- Consistent pattern across portfolio companies
	- Enhanced worker roles rather than full automation

### Technology Infrastructure Challenges

- EMR integration costs becoming prohibitive
	- Cadre team undergoing EMR transition from Netsmart to Wellscott
	- Rhapsody/Redox integration pricing model problematic
		- Base fee plus per-integration charges
		- Some EMRs (ECW) require multiple integrations
		- Integration vendor costs exceeding full EMR subscription costs
	- EMR vendor fees (ECW, NextGen, Flatiron) adding substantial expense
- Market opportunity in integration automation
	- Current pricing models unsustainable for provider businesses
	- AI-driven integration solutions could disrupt expensive vendor model
- Care delivery workflow standardization potential
	- Virtual cardiac rehab case study: gross margins improved from 28% to 67% with AI
	- Founder claims 70% of care delivery workflows identical until provider-patient interaction
	- Platform approach (Tonic) for visual workflow building across use cases
- AI complexity assessment framework needed
	- Simple matching tasks (prior auth policy to patient record) vs complex reasoning
	- Smart DX CDI requiring multiple data types and differential diagnosis
	- Voice AI becoming commoditized - questioning defensible moats beyond low latency
