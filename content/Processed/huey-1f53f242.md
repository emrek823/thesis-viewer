Huey
The next generation in disability care
Huey Health
Investor pitch deck
Website / Facebook / Instagram / Email

## Slide 2: Mission Statement
Our mission is to be the largest & most clinically advanced disability provider in the world, starting with autism care

## Slide 3: Families with autistic children struggle to navigate a fragmented care system and are clueless about what services they need, when, and why

**Roles in a Family's Care System (Visualized as circles around a central "Family" group):**
*   **Family:** Child, Mother, Father, Sister
*   Occupational therapist
*   Special needs teacher
*   Speech therapist
*   Family coach
*   Psychologist
*   Support worker
*   Counselor
*   Nurse aide
*   Dance teacher
*   Art teacher
*   Behavior therapist
*   Sensory specialist

**Identifying & coordinating services is hard work. Families spend 2x more time and 4x more money vs. other families.**

**Statistics:**
*   **Cost of raising an autistic child from age 0 to 18:** ~$1m
*   **% of families who report needing help to manage caregiving stress:** 46%
*   **% of families who report the need to stop or reduce work:** 50%

## Slide 4: Huey seeks to unify the whole-of-life experience and deliver relevant services efficiently, to reduce the time & cost burden as the child grows

**Timeline of Services (Age 0 to Age 18):**

**Age 0 - Pre-school:**
*   **Huey Initial screening:** Childhood screening to assess for risk of developmental disabilities and/or delays
*   **Huey Tele-diagnosis:** Detailed virtual diagnosis based on initial screener and services provided over the last 12 months (Available at launch)
*   **Huey Project ImPACT:** Parent training program to develop social & communication skills in at-risk children (Available at launch)
*   **Huey Psychotherapy:** Caregiver focused therapy focused on topics such as trauma, anxiety, guilt, etc.

**School starts:**
*   **Huey Behavioral therapy:** Naturalistic behavioral therapy to help children develop social, behavioral, and emotional skills (Available at launch)
*   **Huey Speech therapy:** Focused on helping children with speech disorders or delays in communication skills
*   **Huey RUBI Program:** Parent training program to reduce challenging behaviors in at-risk children (Available at launch)
*   **Huey Occupational therapy:** Focused on developing physical and practical life skills within disabled children, incl. addressing sensory needs

**Teenage years begin:**
*   **Huey Parent training:** Parent training at this transition point prepares caregivers for teenage related issues
*   **Huey Psychotherapy:** If needed, additional therapy during the teenage years to support caregiver mental health
*   **Huey Re-assessment:** Disability re-assessment before entering teenage years to understand baseline
*   **Huey Family counselling:** Different from therapy, in that this is more future-focused and helps families achieve goals
*   **Huey Support worker:** In-person support to help the family with the disabled child's tasks and activities

**Transition to young adulthood:**
*   **Huey Parent training:** Parent training at this transition point prepares caregivers for adulthood related issues

## Slide 6: Our GTM focus is to reduce the need for intensive services (20-30 hrs/wk) - we are launching 2 parent training programs to do that

**Parent training for challenging behaviors ("RUBI")**
*   **Description:** Parent training program to reduce challenging behaviors in children with (or at risk of) developmental delays or disabilities.
*   **Delivery structure:** Virtually delivered by a BCBA or BCBA-D
*   **Program structure:** 12-24 weeks, 1-1.5 hrs/week
*   **Reimbursement through:** Insurance, starting with Kaiser/Catalight (contract won)
*   **Cost of program:** $2.6k to $4k per family over ~15 weeks
*   **Examples of prominent institutions adopting program:**
    *   Seattle Children's HOSPITAL • RESEARCH • FOUNDATION
    *   Marcus AUTISM CENTER

**Parent training for communication skills ("Project ImPACT")**
*   **Description:** Parent training program to develop social & communication skills in children with (or at risk of) developmental delays or disabilities.
*   **Delivery structure:** Virtually delivered by a BCBA, Psych, SLP, or LCSW
*   **Program structure:** 12 weeks, 2-3 hrs/week
*   **Reimbursement through:** All 21 Regional Centers in CA (code exists for the program)
*   **Cost of program:** $5k to $6k per family over ~12 weeks
*   **Examples of prominent institutions adopting program:**
    *   UCSF Health
    *   RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

## Slide 7: There is a large amount of evidence to support the use of these programs as empirical & time-efficient for autism treatment

**Parent training for challenging behaviors ("RUBI")**
*   22 published research papers, including one of the largest psychosocial RCT within autism in 2015 (JAMA).

**Parent training for communication skills ("Project ImPACT")**
*   35 published research papers, incl. some papers demonstrating efficacy for Toddlers (12-36 mo) as well.

    *   Treatment group - Project ImPACT 12-weeks (upper values on graph)

## Slide 8: Payers value the efficiency of our model. Kaiser/Catalight has already given us a standalone contract for parent training, with others to follow

**Comparison of typical cost of care - till age 18**

**Graph Data (Cumulative cost of care vs. Child's age):**
*   **Upper Line (Current Providers):** Starts low, steeply increases to ~$1m at 18 yo. Indicates "30-35 hrs/wk" for ABA therapy.
*   **Lower Line (Huey's Model):** Starts low, increases to ~$700k at 18 yo. Indicates "8-10 hrs/wk" for ABA therapy.
*   **Savings:** ~$1m (current) vs ~$700k (Huey) = 30% saving.
*   **Savings being driven by doing parent training upfront before any child-focused intensive services!**

**Costs through current providers**
*   ~60% ($600K) of this cost goes towards clinical & medical care, with ABA, speech, occupational therapy, & medical services being the largest cost items. These services are inefficiently delivered, with rarely any parent training to help caregivers become self-sufficient.

**Costs through Huey's model**
*   Our coordinated & family-centered approach prioritizes family training upfront before any child-focused services (ABA, speech, OT). As a result, families only need less than half the intensity of ABA (~8-10 hrs/wk, instead of 20-30hrs/wk) and other intensive services.

**Services & Reimbursement:**
*   **Available at launch:**
    *   **Huey RUBI Program:** Parent training program to reduce challenging behaviors in at-risk children
    *   **Huey Project ImPACT:** Parent training program to develop social & communication skills in at-risk children
*   **8-10 hrs/wk:**
    *   **Huey ABA therapy:** Naturalistic behavioral therapy to help children develop social, behavioral, and emotional skills
*   **Reimbursed by:**
    *   Kaiser Permanente
    *   Catalight Foundation
    *   Department of Developmental Services (DDS)
    *   San Diego Regional Center

## Slide 9: But why now? A range of factors makes our GTM approach highly relevant and favorable for families, therapists, and payers today

*   **Families are demanding neurodivergent-affirming care (they hate the current ABA model)**
*   **Parent training models have gained strength in evidence, resulting in payer reimbursement**
*   **ABA quality sucks because RBTs are poorly trained (high school grads). Family training is only done by trained BCBAs.**
*   **Top institutions such as UCSF, Seattle Children's, Stanford, etc. have moved away from ABA to parent training**

## Slide 10: This market for disability services is substantial and underserved, with the majority of costs going towards clinical services

**TAM for clinical services for developmentally disabled children in the USA**
*   **Total Annual Market:** ~$91b/yr
*   **Calculation:**
    *   No. of dev. disabled children aged 0-18 in the USA: ~12.6m
    *   Avg. yearly cost of raising a dev. disabled child: ~$12k
    *   % of yearly cost going towards clinical care: ~60%
    *   *Implicit calculation: 12.6m * $12k * 60% = ~$90.72b*

**TAM for clinical services for autistic children in the USA**
*   **Total Annual Market:** ~$56b/yr
*   **Calculation:**
    *   No. of autistic children aged 0-18 in the USA: ~1.7m
    *   Avg. yearly cost of raising an autistic child: ~$55k
    *   % of yearly cost going towards clinical care: ~60%
    *   *Implicit calculation: 1.7m * $55k * 60% = ~$56.1b*

## Slide 11: We are raising ~$3m to execute on our recent contract win & upcoming pipeline, which will accelerate our growth to $3m revenue

**Overall cost breakdown - $3m for 18 months runway**

| Category                | Amount      | Percentage |
| :---------------------- | :---------- | :--------- |
| Clinical delivery & ops/admin | $1.88m      | 63%        |
| Core team               | $703k       | 23%        |
| Tech & ops              | $417k       | 14%        |

**KPIs in Month 18**

| Metric                         | Value       |
| :----------------------------- | :---------- |
| Estimated MRR                  | ~$250K      |
| No. of ongoing therapists      | Up to 18    |
| Estimated daily caseload (families) | ~360        |
| Unique families per year       | ~1k         |

## Slide 12: Having won a contract with the most difficult payer (Kaiser/Catalight) in just 4 months, we are confident in our ability to win future contracts

**Current contract wins**
*   **Started discussion in Feb-23, Won in Jun-23 - 4 months**
*   **Kaiser Permanente**
*   **Catalight Foundation**
*   **Kaiser/Catalight:** Effective 16 June 2023, with Huey regarded as a "Kaiser-affiliated provider". Can serve EPO, HMO, Medi-Cal Managed Care, POS, and Senior Advantage plans in California. This contract sets a unique precedent, in that it enables standalone reimbursement for our parent training model outside of the traditional 3-tier ABA program.

**Upcoming pipeline**
*   **DDS (Department of Developmental Services)**
*   **San Diego Regional Center**
*   **Regional centers:** Huey is currently vendoring with regional centers. One contract will allow us to serve ALL 21 centers across the State (they serve ~300k families/yr). Exp. Q3/Q4-23.
*   **UCSF Health**
*   **UCSF Health:** Potential partnership in the works, starting with UCSF referring families to Huey for the Project ImPACT program, expanding to other areas such as RUBI thereafter. Exp. Q4-23.
*   **aetna**
*   **EVERNORTH.**
*   **Optum**
*   **blue of california**
*   **Other payers:** Pursue direct contracting with other large insurance plans within California. These contracts will not be the standard "in-network" contracts for ABA or mental health services, but rather unique for our parent training programs, leveraging the Kaiser/Catalight precedent. Exp. Q1-24.

## Slide 13: Most of our direct competitors are small-scale clinics operating across the country and university hospital institutions serving larger cities

**Direct competitors**
These companies deliver the same (or similar) model(s) to us through the same GTM channels.
*   **A large number of small clinics:** Who employ 6-12 therapists and deliver the same model (mostly in-person) to families in specific counties.

**Synergistic direct competitors**
University hospital institutions operate a fixed service capacity and grow slowly. Most maintain waitlists for services, and as such, are more synergistic to Huey rather than competitive.
*   UCSF Health
*   Seattle Children's HOSPITAL • RESEARCH • FOUNDATION
*   Marcus AUTISM CENTER
*   RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

**Institutional competitors**
These companies are mostly PE-backed and operate multi-state practices with multiple services. Providers in this group are the "status quo" and do not provide family training models like ours.
*   CARD (CENTER FOR AUTISM & RELATED DISORDERS)
*   AUTISM SERVICES (ACSES)
*   TRUMPET BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
*   Butterfly Effects (Transforming Lives Through ABA Therapy)
*   Kyo
*   kadiant
*   elemy
*   popya (bringing hope home)
*   *Note:* These competitors are focused on expanding access to ABA, and maximizing the no. of hours/time spent in ABA, which is exactly what we are reducing through our model.

**Other competitors**
While these companies are all virtual-first, many of them are not autism focused, and some which are, deliver a different clinical model, geared more towards child-focused ABA virtually rather than parent training.
*   Autism360
*   answersnow
*   DQTCOM THERAPY
*   brightline (Not Autism focused)
*   Little Otter (Not Autism focused)
