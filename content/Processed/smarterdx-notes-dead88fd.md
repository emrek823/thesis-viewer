### 10.7

Update

White plains

Retrospective - juiced the numbers a little bit b/c we only reviewed the good ones → $5m in expected annual value

Live: Beat juiced estimate by a bit (not that much more than 5) and we’ll take 10%.

None of these count the quality diagnoses that we’re finding - learn how to value for the hospital

Last month set a record for CMI

Mclaren

Deploy end of this month

Pipeline

Always give a huge discount to the probability that anything will go through

Revise probabilities for several customers upwards several times (great thing!)

50% probability going live by end of Q1

UHS

Arkansas

UCSF

Montefiore

Prisma Health

Couple others

Hitting max of our capabilities

PR

Next steps

Next month straightforward - Mclaren, convert, in contracting

6-18 months - round out current product vs. next strategic direction

How to side step this broader RCM management - what’s the hospital strategy

Revenues they wouldn’t otherwise had

Speed of integration

How do we improve our program over time and not just improving right now

Program - how do we know what we missed? You don’t today. SDX can provide that. That was a huge difference maker

TGH feedback

10.7

Tech is finding, but people have to execute on recommendations. Agree rate getting to 65%

Mclaren: Larger health system, entrenched workers

Establishing processes to manually adjudicate some of these things

Things we didn’t look for before Mclaren

WP: Tiny , direct line to everyone

3-6 reference customers

Pipeline

Houston Methodist

Arkansas

Low risk, pre-bill - no risk to us. No physician workflows

Not enough info to segment the market right now but logos can do the talking

Sandra

Thrives in the conference environment + wining / dining people and she hasn’t had a ton of that yet

UC Davis - out of conference

Intelligence on the health system

BI analyst boss prioritize what we’re doing

### 12.2

McLaren + White Plains

McLaren - annualizing bit north of $10M (1500 beds). B/c

Better program upstream, better reimbursement (rural MI vs. NYC)

Pilots

UCSF

UHS - 26 hospital system

3-4m annualized

Retrospective

Houton Methodist

Arkanass - deploying

Late-stage

2 outher houston sales

All in all - adjust probability

$1m today -> $5m by EOY 2023

Revenue run-rate

Increase $ take (6-10% w/ White Plains Mclaren) to 15-20%

Biggest challenge

Scaling the team

Close rate is high. 3/4 of times the person accepts

Fit goo counter narrative

Mid RCM - healthcare, healthcare data, not just selling ads

Product velocity

Technical debt? Not optimal engineering hires? Better managing post-hiring?

Remote setting makes that dx harder

Sensitivity / specificity -

Agree Rate

Integration

Infra needs to be setup so we can add additional hospitals w/o increasing complexity

Features we’re hearing from customers

User mgmt feature

Monitor my workflow feature

All customers are buying the same product (haven’t

Reduce human in the loop amount

Scale pre-bill to $100M, but data would put us in position to do really cool things.

Surgical denials - surgeon decides spinal fusion is more optimal (

Inpatient approvals/denials

Denied for sepsis and the appeal that someone has to write is that sepsis is justified for these 3 factors. We are already pulling that. Pulling that in same data and outputting

GPT-3 can construct that letter

$100

GTM / sales learning

April to Sept/Oct

There’s 2 things that are slightly separate and we solve 1 but not the other

The hospital CEO thinks that are priorities are araes A,B,C. We don’t see RCM as an exec priority

More $ gets more attention but at the same time, within RCM we already do stuff in CDI/Coding.

We don’t do anything for this area over here

Hospitals are in cost cuttign mode. The idea of more revenue is great. B/c margins are so small. More revenue doesn’t solve by itself in the abstract

Our revenue is basically pure margin but convincing them is a different category is a frameshift for them

Hospital CFOs deal with large #’s all day long. 5m-10m seems small

Even at White Plains - if I want 5m in revenue, there are so many ways to get it. But not factoring in margin!

True at TGH
