### Key Series A Pitch Deck Feedback

- Deck quality not yet at high standard required for Series A fundraising
- Current version lacks specificity and depth needed to demonstrate expertise
- Main goal: strengthen slides to show Aris and Ywen’s deep pharma market knowledge
- Need to balance detail without overwhelming 20-30 second slide review time

### Opening Slides & Hook Strategy

- Lead with 2.3M ARR momentum story - unique Series A differentiator
- Three key themes to highlight:
- Already contracted with biggest pharma brands - emphasize this heavily
- Remove ambiguity, be objective and specific like LP pitch approach

### Market Sizing & Opportunity Focus

- 100B total market slide needs visual redesign (concentric circles vs. current format)
- Problem: 12 + 4 ≠ 100 math confusion on current slide
- Focus market story on content execution + media activation specifically
- Quantify average spend per bucket in commercialization process
- Add “per drug” specificity to 500M commercialization cost stat
- Remove generic “fragmentation” language for specific pharma pain points

### Product Positioning & Differentiation

- Current problem slide too high-level vs. actual problem being solved
- Need to isolate content execution + media activation as specific wedge
- Explain why starting with content vs. other stack components
- Add quantified ROI deltas in agency comparison (90% faster, cost multiples)
- Include third column showing specific cost/time savings

### Why Now & Defensibility

- Patent cliff pressure driving speed-to-market urgency
- Personalized medicine increasing competitive pressure
- LLM advancements specific to pharma content-dense industry
- Need technical architecture slide showing complexity
- Distinguish from Jasper/generic content - pharma-specific regulatory requirements
- AOR relationship stickiness once brand knowledge captured

### Growth Projections & Roadmap

- Extend timeline from Q1 pivot point through 2027
- Show explosive vs. linear growth trajectory
- Split current vs. new client growth in stacked bars
- Reference Real Chemistry 900M revenue as concrete billion-dollar precedent
- Change “within 10 years” to 2-3 years for AI-native business speed
- Remove detailed hiring breakdown from final fundraising slide

### Next Steps

- Sean: Available Monday noon Eastern for deck review
- Solstice team: Refine deck incorporating all feedback by Monday
- Goal: Deck ready for Series A conversations post-JP Morgan week
- Focus on hitting high bar given slim margins in current Series A market
