### Pipeline Progress & Deal Status

- 6 biopharma companies confirmed pricing and started MSA/SOW process
	- Fathom: Quickest to move, onboarding over next couple weeks
	- Insight: Moving forward with 10k for 2-3 pieces of content (prior to full 144k contract)
	- Sanofi, Alexion, Biogen, Takeda all in legal/security clearance phase
- Biogen co-pitching with former agency contact
	- Pitched 500k pricing for platform only
	- Second call completed, longer sales cycle expected
- Takeda follow-up next week with entire team
	- Provided all brand documents for Freezaco to train system
	- Currently using inferior competitor “Shaman” - opportunity to demonstrate superiority
- Strong inbound pipeline: J&J (enterprise tech team), GSK, multiple other prospects
- Daily prospecting conversations with multiple companies per day

### Customer Usage Patterns & Platform Strategy

- Usage varies by brand maturity
	- Launch brands: Nearly daily usage (multiple times per week minimum)
	- Mature brands: 1-2 assets per week (seen with Alexion requests)
	- Early stage companies like Fathom: Heavy anticipated usage
- Customer preference trending toward Solstice handling content creation vs self-service
	- Exception: Sanofi creates content in-house (no agencies), will definitely use platform directly
	- Most others prefer agency model - Solstice doing work on their behalf
- Content quality feedback: Some concerns about “flat” appearance
	- Working to balance regulatory compliance with visual appeal
- Expansion within organizations already happening organically
	- Sanofi: Got inbound from French team day after initial conversation
	- AstraZeneca: Invited other teams to view capabilities
	- Pharma trend toward vendor consolidation creates opportunity

### Hiring & Next Steps

- Engineering hiring remains challenging
	- Universal problem across companies
	- Have good leads, hoping to convert soon
	- Request for Virtue support on candidate closing process once serious candidates identified
- Revenue projection: 1.1M by end of year remains conservative estimate
	- Significant upside potential with current pipeline
	- Biogen deal alone could substantially increase numbers
- Focus remains on execution: close current deals, deliver exceptional initial customer experience, establish expansion playbook
