## Slide 1

Better. Faster. Cheaper. And the most compliant.

---

## Slide 2

ACOs (Providers in Risk Contract with CMS)
Benchmarks are based on prior-year claims diagnoses. By influencing edits to those diagnoses—via owned or contracted groups—ACOs can improve benchmarks and increase shared savings.

Initial Customer Segments

Providers in Risk Contracts with Payers
Providers often take full risk from MA and ACA payors. These payors accept diagnosis data from providers to support CMS submissions, directly impacting pass-through revenue.

Payers
MA and ACA plans are paid based on member risk scores, which are based on documented member conditions.
They can submit supplemental diagnoses to CMS to ensure accurate, complete reimbursement.

High Accuracy on HCCs
95% Recall and 80% Precision on V28 HCCs, much higher than last generation NLP models

Audit-Ready Compliance
Each diagnosis is fully documented with supporting evidence, including the exact text from the chart and reasoning (eg. MEAT)

Greater Velocity
Thousands of charts can be processed at the same time

Supports Key Workflows
Data ingestion and integration, document splitting, metadata extraction, claims to chart matching, multipass review
