**The big picture:** The suggestive note and lewd drawing bearing what appears to be the president's signature prompted a [new round of denials](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/09/white-house-denies-trump-epstein-note) from the White House and its surrogates. Its release renewed scrutiny of [Trump's ties](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/09/trump-epstein-relationship-timeline) to the disgraced financier.
