# Document Content

We came across a solution specifically called Assort Health that's selling to providers of various different specialties that I believe you're a customer of or evaluating, implementing and wanted to go deeper specifically on Assort. What may be helpful though, just to frame the call is would love to hear a little bit more about your background, the practice you're a part of and your role there, how many doctors, physicians there are. That might be a great place to start, then we can dive in from there.

## Expert
Absolutely. Our practice is an orthopedic practice or musculoskeletal practice. We have four office locations. We have 17 physicians.

## Client
How many practices? About 17 physicians.

## Expert
Seventeen physicians. Four locations. Besides the docs, we have 12 mid-level providers, so either physician assistants or nurse practitioners. We also have physical and occupational therapy in all four of our locations. There's approximately 40 providers that fall into that PT/OT category. We also have MRI in two of our offices. Pretty busy office, pretty busy practice. Lots of phone calls that come in on a daily basis and monthly basis.

## Client
I'm fortunate in my life to have not needed to go to a specialty physician yet. I just go see my primary doctor. Orthopedics is like you break your bone?

## Expert
We're the carpenters of the medical field. We put you back together when you break something. That's the easiest way that we tease all the time. They use power equipment just like a carpenter would, saws, drills and all that stuff.

Wonderful. A lot of the calls you get are, I'm imagining, have a more emergency type tone to them, just given what you may have told me or there's regular checkers. What may be helpful is I'm obviously leading to the why'd you pick Assort Health and what drew you there? What might be helpful, is the calls. Maybe give me a sense for the volume, the types of calls and how you fielded them before call center or something else.

## Expert
Okay. Just to give you at least a little bit of a flavor, we take about somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 incoming phone calls for scheduling every month. Call it, 250-300 calls a day on average.

## Client
Just for scheduling?

## Expert
Correct.

## Client
What percent of call volume is scheduling?

## Expert
It's probably 60% of our calls.

## Client
What are the other major categories?

### Expert Insights

**Expert**:
We'll have patients calling in for questions about potential surgery that they need to talk to a clinical provider, whether it's a physician or one of the clinical staff that works with the doctor. Just regular questions more than anything else. Could be prescription refills, I'd say, miscellaneous kinds of things. We get a lot of phone calls for our billing side of life as well. There are calls about bills and maybe insurance companies calling us in, calling in as well.

**Client**:
Got it. Questions for the physician or clinician staff about appointments or treatment, prescription refills, billing. The lion's share, 60% are for scheduling. You said 5,000-6,000 incoming phone calls for scheduling every month, 250-300 calls per day. I cut you off there. I apologize.

**Expert**:
No worries. We've handled that up until our relationship with Assort, which really started the end of November when we went live with them. Before that, all those phone calls were being handled by about seven full-time equivalent centralized scheduling call center folks.

**Client**:
Were they U.S.-based?

**Expert**:
Yeah, they are all U.S.-based. They were actually based in our main office. All employed by the practice itself. We still don't really outsource those calls.

**Client**:
Got it. Did they handle all the calls or was it just scheduling? I'm guessing for the physician or clinic staff they would route them, what percent of calls did they handle and what percent got routed out?

**Expert**:
Of the calls coming in, again, the scheduling phone calls are 250-300 a day phone calls that are coming in. Those were all for scheduling. In addition to that, there's probably 150 to maybe 200 phone calls that get routed to either our surgical schedulers, which is different than scheduling for a regular appointment to see the doctor, or would be for those clinical staff and prescriptions and questions about the treatment that they're going through, that kinds of stuff. Those all get handled through, I'm going to call it an operator, because that's really what they are. They just pretty much triage those phone calls.

**Client**:
Got it. These seven FTEs are only for the 250-300 scheduling calls. Everything else, they'll route to someone that's more directly associated with the clinical staff.

**Expert**:
You got it.

**Client**:
Great. Surgical scheduler, nurse practitioner, occupational therapist, all those other folks. How much were you paying monthly or yearly for the seven FTE equivalents?

**Expert**:
Annually, probably close to the low to mid six figures annually.

**Client**:
Awesome. You went live with Assort in November 2024. Just before we get there quickly.

# Expert-Client Conversation Transcript

## Expert
Yep.

## Client
Three interrelated questions. What problem were you trying to solve when you were looking for voice AI solutions? Who did you look at? Why did you choose Assort?

## Expert
Got you. The problem we were trying to solve is, last fall we started to lose staff. People were leaving for whatever reason, either personal reasons, health issues, found a better job somewhere else, paid more money, closer to home, whatever. We went from seven people to three, believe it or not, in that call center.

## Client
Okay.

## Expert
We were having wait times that were in some cases 20-30 minutes while somebody was on hold waiting to schedule an appointment. We had abandonment rates that were touching that 40% range. Four out of every 10 phone calls that were in there were just hanging up because they couldn't get through.

## Client
You would just lose that business, basically?

## Expert
Potentially, just either lose that business or maybe they call back. You hope that they would call back.

## Client
Yeah, but you don't know.

## Expert
We don't know what we don't know when it comes to that.

## Client
For that problem, who all did you look at in the market?

## Expert
To be brutally honest, we didn't really look at anybody other than Assort. We knew of a couple of other options out there. I know Hello Patient's one. ParakeetAI, I think, is the other one that was out there. We did a little bit of research on them, but Assort actually came to us through a relationship we had with a different vendor that we were working on with a different issue not related to answering phone calls. We were working with them on an ability gain, the clinical imaging that was done outside of our practice.

If somebody went to the emergency room and had an X-ray taken as an example, and we wanted to get access to that X-ray image itself so it's easier on the patient, they were helping us get those and putting them into our system, so we had access to them. They had been working with Assort. They knew a little bit about Assort and they said, "You guys ought to look at these guys."

That's really what we did, is we started down that path with Assort. I will tell you, I am not a huge fan of artificial intelligence and the whole virtual assistant just from my own interactions not here, but not with Assort. When you dial Xfinity or AT&#x26;T and you go through the phone trees and that kind of stuff, I'm not a fan, put it that way. I was very reluctant to even make the phone call and talk to these guys, but I did because we were, like I said.

## Client
Short-staffed. Totally.

## Expert
We have to figure out what do we need to do. That's why we went down that path. After talking with them, I didn't feel that there was anybody else out there from the research that we had done that would be any better, at least at that point in time.

We also knew that we would be an early adopter with Assort. There's no question about it that we got, I would say, much better attention to what we wanted to do. We'd help them, they help us kind of a thing. The pricing was better as an early adopter that beta site form. Those were the reasons why we went down that path.

## Client
Awesome. One just higher-level question then want to dig into specifics on the Assort product implementation, pricing, etc. First, it sounds like the reason you went with them initially is just another vendor who you obviously trust, recommended you look at them. What's the right way to put this? How much do vendor referrals matter in your business, specifically in your industry more broadly?

## Expert
It depends on whether it's a trusted vendor or not.

## Client
Let's just say, like your EMR provider.

## Expert
Yeah, which happens to be athenahealth, just so you know, whether that matters or not. athena is a very open architecture, so they have their APIs that are pretty open to anybody, any vendor out there. The integration with athena was huge. Assort already had that relationship with athena, so that played a big part in why we wanted to go with them. We didn't have to start from scratch, so that's very huge.

## Client
Got it. The fact that they're a partner of athena matters quite a bit because everything needs to connect to your EMR.

## Expert
Correct.

## Client
Wonderful. When did you sign up with Assort? How long did the implementation take, and how long have you been live with them so far?

## Expert
We signed with them at the, I want to say, end of September, beginning of October is when we actually signed the agreement. We went live right around Thanksgiving time.

## Client
Went live Thanksgiving. It took four weeks, it sounds like, to implement.

## Expert
Four to five weeks. Correct.

# Client-Expert Conversation Transcript

## Client
Was it a good experience, the implementation?

## Expert
Yeah, it was. They did extremely well. They took a lot of time. They took time to understand the idiosyncrasies of our physicians and their scheduling parameters and again, idiosyncrasies that go with that. We were fortunate enough to already have a lot of that laid out for our own staff. If you were calling in with an issue with your hand, we're not going to schedule you with somebody who only works on your back.

We already had those parameters set up, so they were able to adapt what we had already set up and be able to input that into their software on the AI side of life to pretty much duplicate what we did with live agents using the virtual assistant. They did it extremely quickly, you can see, five to six weeks or whatever it was, maybe seven. I can't even remember the exact timing of it.

There was a lot of back and forth, trial and error with it, nothing more than I would expect with anybody else, they were actually much better than others out there, but they were able to adapt to that. When we pulled the trigger and went live, we continued to tweak the system. The beauty of AI and like I'm telling somebody who probably knows something about it, but the computer actually learns from its mistakes and can make those changes.

## Client
Yeah, it gets better over time. Absolutely.

## Expert
People don't always do that. If I have a human being making the same mistake over and over again, you can talk to them until you're blue in the face, and hopefully they get it. AI, you tell them you did this wrong, and this is why you did it wrong, it learns and hopefully doesn't make the mistake again.

Again, we've tweaked it a lot over the five months, six months that we've been live with Assort. We've tweaked all those idiosyncrasies of our own schedules, our physician schedules a lot, and they've been extremely helpful. They've actually figured out ways to do things that we were doing with live agents better through AI, and we've adapted that again back onto the live agents because we still have patients that don't want to talk to a virtual assistant. They want to talk to a live human being.

## Client
I know you mentioned, I apologize if I missed this. You mentioned you had seven FTEs, you went down to three. Of the, whatever, 5,000-6,000 a month in scheduling calls that come through, how many are handled by Assort now? How big is your real human team?

## Expert
We staffed up the human team. We were back actually at full strength even when Assort was starting with us. We got back up to seven about two months into the Assort, I am going to call trial basis with them. We have since lost two people. Again, not the right fit for the organization or that role. Right now, we've got really four and a half FTEs that are still there that are working on it, and we are not replacing the other two and a half that we lost because we just do not need to with the Assort running this now.

## Client
If you lose one more, would you need to replace them? I'm trying to get a sense.

## Expert
Probably not. Our break even, when we first looked at Assort from a ROI perspective, it was about one and a half FTEs, was our break even. For what we were paying Assort to what we were paying our staff, if we got to five and a half FTEs versus the seven, we would be break even. Wouldn't cost us anything.

## Conversation Transcript

### Client
Got it. If you lose one more like where you are today, you're actually very.

### Expert
Yeah, we're right.

### Client
Could you walk me through the pricing on Assort today?

### Expert
Sure. It's changed since we originally did this as well. We've renegotiated. In spite of having really what was a two-year agreement, we've gone back to them and renegotiated, added things to what the original offering was and of course up the price a little bit.

The original price that we had was between $60K to $70k a year, whatever that works out to be monthly, or thereabouts was our price. That handled about 2,500, 2,600 phone calls that they took from cradle to grave. They took the incoming call. They were able to book that appointment with that patient. That was what they called a engaged caller.

If somebody would call in and get to the virtual agent and for whatever reason they couldn't schedule the appointment, whether it be they didn't understand the patient, the AI didn't understand the patient or the patient wanted just talk to a live human being that would be a disengaged patient and we would not get charged for it. If we went over that 2,500 calls in a month, it was costing us a couple a little more than $2 a call after that. We have not gone over it.

### Client
Okay, so today around $55,000 to $65,000 per year.

### Expert
Yeah. That was until actually seven days ago, put it that way. We renegotiated our contract and our agreement with Assort. We've added a couple different things to it. Number one, the virtual agent now will reside on our phone system and part of our IVR for 24/7 call. If somebody calls in at 8:00 P.M., we're not here. Nobody's here to schedule that patient. They can actually schedule their appointment through Assort at 8:00 P.M. or 2:00 A.M. That just went live with that.

The other thing is we actually took out the number of phone calls and renegotiated to be unlimited phone calls that are processed by them. The third thing that we're working on right now and implementing has not gone live yet is a way to literally transcribe that phone call. If it's for one of our clinical team members, so if they want to talk to Dr. Smith's clinical team, they'll transcribe the call itself and they will actually put it into our electronic medical record, athena, what athena calls a patient case, which could then be worked by the clinical team member. It can be done at 9:00 P.M. It'll just make things a lot easier.

We're not calling a patient back if that's the case and saying, "Okay, can you explain to me what you were asking for?" Because they didn't take down the voicemail real well. It'll be, I won't say a game changer, but it's going to help a lot. Yet to be determined how much it's going to help. We're expecting it to be pretty significant time savings for our clinical team.

### Client
Yeah. You can literally create a case and you renegotiated. Are you paying the same, more, less?

### Expert
No, we're paying more than what we were before because of that 24/7 call coverage now versus during our normal 8:00 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. coverage that we've had. Again, at a very, very reduced price from what they would normally be charging because we're helping them develop this. It increased our price by about $30,000 over what we were paying before.

# Transcript

## Client
Got it. Did they give you a sense of what they were discounting you?

## Expert
Yeah. They were giving us probably at least half off of what they would have charged for those two additional items.

## Client
You would have paid $200,000, if I'm doing the math.

## Expert
We would have probably paid more like $150,000, probably closer to $150,000.

## Client
The reason they're giving you the discount.

## Expert
Right, is because we were helping develop that. We've been helping develop their system and make it more user friendly across the board. We also, I will tell you, can be a reference site for them, as we are centrally located. If somebody wants to come in and actually see it in action, we're here and we do that with athena and athena clients. We be that reference site sometimes. Now we haven't done that, but for Assort, we've taken phone calls from people that have asked about and given them our honest opinion of how well it's working.

## Client
What is your honest one-line assessment.

## Expert
Had you asked me the same question three months ago, I would have told you, jury's out. We're not willing to give up on it yet, but it wasn't working as well as we would have liked or what we thought it would be. They've made substantial improvements to really help us and I think help others. Not just us, but in the software itself.

I would tell you now, I don't know what we do without Assort. If I had to recommend it, I would say they're definitely a leader. They understand physician practices, which is pretty amazing, to tell you the truth. Not all vendors understand that, especially in a space that isn't necessarily always just dedicated to healthcare.

## Client
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
