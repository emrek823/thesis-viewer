### Current Growth Status & Challenges

- Growth bottleneck identified: 1 person at peak capacity doing account management, limiting lead handling volume
- June performance roughly flat week-over-week with May
- Primary challenge: Need to be first responder to leads for effective conversion
- Solution approach:
	- Opening new role for hybrid sales/account management
	- Considering creating specialized functions between sales and account management
	- Planning two-week sprint in July to validate lead conversion hypotheses

### Geographic Expansion Progress

- Technical platform extended for multi-state operations
	- Oregon and Virginia ready to launch
	- New states take approximately 3 days to set up technically
- Engaging fintech law firm for compliance needs
- New hire (lawyer background) starting on strategy/ops side for regulatory compliance
- Can spin up supply on demand, allowing opportunistic market entry
- Targeting launch in Oregon next week

### Clara’s Core Value Proposition

- Unique access to high-quality caregiver supply
- Key differentiation: “We’ve cracked high-quality caregiver supply”
	- Can acquire caregiver supply quickly and efficiently
	- Identified as competitors’ biggest challenge
- Model delivers:
	- Better care outcomes
	- More affordable pricing
	- Higher caregiver satisfaction
	- Operational efficiency through regulatory arbitrage

### Strategic Considerations for Series A

- Current target: $1M in revenue by March next year
- Need to demonstrate:
	- Clear differentiation beyond basic NPS improvements
	- Operational leverage and efficiency
	- Scalable distribution advantage
- Recommendation to focus on:
	- Measuring absolute and trend metrics over next 8-9 months
	- Leveraging unique caregiver supply solution
	- Demonstrating why solving caregiver supply matters

Next Steps:

- Execute two-week sprint in July for lead conversion validation
