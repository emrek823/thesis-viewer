## Slide 2: Care management is inefficient and increasingly expensive

Patients forget 85% of clinical instructions

1 in 5 patients are readmitted, costing $41B per year in penalties

Transitional care accounts for 18% of health system budgets (9% in 2016)

**Cost of Care Management**

| Year | Fraction of Budget (%) |
| :--- | :------------------- |
| 2011 | 4                    |

## Slide 16: COVID-19 Response

16

## Slide 17: COVID-19 volume has overwhelmed health systems and testing is still limited

There is extreme anxiety around COVID-19 and limited access to accurate information

Health systems are struggling to manage ER and hotline volume due to low-risk patients and COVID-19 R₀

Absent remote screening tools to determine at-risk populations, health organizations will struggle to support their communities adequately

MEMORA HEALTH 17

## Slide 18: Memora is helping health systems leverage SMS to manage COVID-19

**Features**
**Patient-facing:**
*   Text-based screenings and automated Q&A to enable low-barrier access to screening and accurate information
*   Aggregate data on zip codes where outbreaks are likely to help health systems allocate resources

**Provider-facing:**
*   Text-based screenings of clinicians for burnout
*   Aggregate data on department-wide burnout to determine what resources front-line workers need

**Traction**
*   21 health systems signed in 3 weeks (5 for non-COVID programs)
*   815k new users across 4 countries
*   Coordinating with U.S. FDA and Canadian Ministry of Health on national implementations

MEMORA HEALTH CONFIDENTIAL 18

## Slide 19: COVID-19 has ushered in an era of virtual care at an unprecedented rate

**1**
COVID-19 has forced clinics and health systems to heavily rely on secure communication and telemedicine to continue supporting care

**2**
Health systems and clinics are relying on Memora Health to automate and support virtual care using SMS and content not supported via EMRs

**3**
Changes in people interacting with health care virtually will drive mass adoption of digital health systems (Memora Health), accelerating growth.

30 days of data validates this hypothesis.
