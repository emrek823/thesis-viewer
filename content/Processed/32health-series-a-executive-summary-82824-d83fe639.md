## Slide 4: OPPORTUNITY

Dental insurance is a $150B+ market built on a legacy tech stack & manual workflows

**~17% ($5 pmpm)**
of every dental premium ($30 pmpm) spent on admin expenses due to
- Antiquated tech
- Manual workflows
- Low electronic adoption

**Chart: U.S. Dental Service Spend**

| Year      | U.S. Dental Service Spend |
| :-------- | :------------------------ |
| 2024E     | $156B                     |
| 2030E     | $216B                     |

CAGR: 6.8%

**32HEALTH** PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL 4

## Slide 5: WHY NOW

Dental insurers must automate back-end tasks to improve margins due to recent regulatory pressures & market dynamics

**REGULATORY & MARKET PRESSURES ARE FORCING AUTOMATION**

**Impending mandated dental loss ratios**
As of 2025 in Mass, >83% of premium must go to care (vs.70% typically). Other states are expected to emulate as happened with medical. This would require payers to cut admin expenses to maintain margins while continuing to offer competitive premiums and benefits offerings

**Competitive dental plans required to win market share**
88% of Americans have dental insurance and >90% of MA plans (50M members) offer a dental benefit. Insurers (e.g., CVS/Aetna, Humana) are forced to reduce admin costs for dental benefits to continue to offer competitive benefits to attract members who see dental as a differentiator (#2 benefit after medical)

**Value-based care requires more benefits integration**
Medical-dental integration is starting to show effective outcomes (Kaiser, BCBS), driving adoption of more complex plan design and increased spend on manual admin resources

**BUT CARRIERS/DSOS STRUGGLE TO BUILD OR BUY AI SOLUTIONS**

**Carriers / DSOs are actively looking for AI solutions**
Insurers and providers have historically leveraged AI/ML for image analysis (~20% of claims require image analysis) but now want to leverage advances in LLMs to impact the other 80% of claims/interactions

**Build: customers don't have human capital to build internally**
Carriers/DSOs fundamentally cannot build product internally because they are unable to attract engineering talent required to implement novel technology solutions, especially AI. <1% of dental insurance organizations have built internal team for AI initiatives

**Buy: existing vendors lack dental AND AI expertise**
Existing dental specific platforms are antiquated, cumbersome and costly, (>$100M over 5 years per payer), while more general insuretech platforms aren't purpose built for dental - resulting in lower accuracy/automation for dental workflows

**32HEALTH.** PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL 5

## Slide 6: PROBLEM

Carriers / DSOs losing massive revenue due to manual workflows

| Challenge / Product / ROI | Human intervention in adjudicating claims | Paper claims intake | Credential & onboard providers | Call experience & resolution |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **Challenges**            | (30% manual today)                        | 15% - 30%           | 60 - 90 days                   | High average handle times (>5 mins) & low first call resolution (60%) |
| **32H Product**           | 32Health's AI claim adjudication eliminates manual intervention in adjudication | AI claims intake automation for non-electronic claims | 32Health's AI credentialing product ensures accuracy in credentialing with NCQA standards | Omni channel call experience using 32Health's AI virtual agents |
| **ROI**                   | 90% Auto adjudication rate                | 94% In manual claims processing | 90% Providers credentialed in real time | 75% In provider call costs |

They combined that history with incredibly nimble technical expertise and created just the tool we needed to push the EASY button for us in the credentialing area. We have been able to free up our people to do what humans do best in provider relations—foster relationships with our dental offices. We are saving time, money, labor and have improved employee satisfaction with the job we and they would rather be doing!"
