Hermes Health powers the rails for fast, secure access to identified patient data – transforming how healthcare data moves.

Opportunity: Identified Data is Untapped, $200B Market

The $20B healthcare data market has evolved from

Patient Reported Outcomes (Health Cor)

De-identified aggregated data (IQVIA)

De-identified data linked Data (Datavant)

However all de-identified data is inherently limited to identifying trends making it difficult to associate causality. Furthermore it has disconnected us from the patient leaving a big gap in the market.

The next wave is identified data

Rich, longitudinal data on patients (medical records, claims, images, etc)

That is actionable, and gives organizations the ability to re-engage patients to close the loop

There is an opportunity to leverage identified data to not only support existing use cases, but also to create new ones.

Personal injury

Life Insurance

Clinical Research

Health Care Operations

Health Plans

Patient Consented data networks

Personalized medical AI agents

But to unlock identified data you need to create a data network that is liquid and ubiquitous enabling patients and their representatives to access data easily at scale.

Problem: The Identified Data Market is Fragmented and Slow, Limiting Utility

HIEs and TEFCA were designed to enable seamless health data exchange — but in practice, they’ve added more fragmentation:

Different data sources with inconsistent participation and coverage

Conflicting rules and standards across networks and states

Multiple access methods that vary by EHR, facility, and intermediary

We now have a patchwork of disconnected networks, making it harder, to access identified patient data at scale

Why Now: Identified Data is Experiencing a Revolution and (it’s not TEFCA)

Custodians of identified medical data are becoming more comfortable with sharing identified data. These custodians include:

Release of Information Vendors

EHR Vendors

Claims Clearing Houses

Imaging Vendors

Each of these custodians has created and is creating APIs to enable the exchange of identified health data under the proper HIPAA guide lines

The problem is that each custodian represents a small footprint of the total available data and as a result is having difficulty getting uptake and monetizing their data access.

APIs: Datavant, ShareCare, Athena, they can’t grow the market so need to

Solution: Hermes Data Network

In order to unlock identified data Hermes has created the first neutral middleware network that streamlines access to identified data by connecting Requestors directly with the custodians of identified data (we call them our Partners).

How it Works: One API, One Platform, One Network

Requestor sends a patient request to Hermes (name, date of birth, zip, and HIPAA Authorization)

Hermes finds what partner in our network has access to the patients medical record

Hermes then routes the request to the partner

Partner send the request back to Hermes

Hermes routes the request to the Partner

Two Sided Value of the Network:

We drive more revenue and reduce costs for requestors (quicker turnaround times, less labor) and data vendors (more demand, no tech burden)

Data Vendors (Supply):

We’ve reached X% coverage of ROI vendors, Y% of claims, and are expanding into Z. This our moat

Requestors (Demand): We started with law firms / legal (generating $X in bookings by end of year), and are expanding into X,Y,Z

Business Model: We monetize with requestors and have a simple, high margin business model that pays us while we build the network

Strategic Vision: Our vision is a world where access to identified health data is ubiquitous, liquid, and secure. To accomplish this, we will work with every organization that is exchanging data across the healthcare system and enable every use case that requires data at scale. We will realize this vision in 3 stages

Future World: If LLMs are the front door to healthcare, Hermes will be the neutral API that gives these models on-demand access to provenance-rich identified patient records.

Questions

Why now? Why hasn’t this been done before?

Why are you partnering with ROI vendors?

How valuable is this data / partners actually?

Why did you start with law?

What does this specifically enable (use cases)?

What is tech/AI story here?

Network effects / moat?
