Amgen buys protein-degrading startup Dark Blue for up to $840M

The deal hands Amgen a drug that destroys two proteins known to drive certain types of acute myeloid leukemia, a profile that could set it apart from current medications.

Amgen will acquire a cancer drug developer called Dark Blue Therapeutics, the companies announced Tuesday, in a deal that could be worth as much as $840 million.

Dark Blue, a biotechnology company headquartered in Oxford, England, has a preclinical drug prospect that can “degrade” troublesome proteins. That type of approach represents a way to get after tough-to-reach drug targets, and has drawn the interest of several large pharmaceutical companies in recent years.

Amgen’s pipeline includes two treatments in human testing for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One, Blincyto, is in late-stage testing for adults with the blood cancer. The other, Kyprolis, is being tested in pediatric cases.

“With its world-leading capabilities in oncology and deep experience in developing, manufacturing and commercializing novel medicines, we are confident that Amgen will build on our preclinical work to bring DBT 3757 to the patients who urgently need new treatment options,” Alastair MacKinnon, Dark Blue’s CEO, said in a separate statement.

Alongside its leukemia drug, the biotech startup has publicly revealed two other programs targeting an RNA-editing enzyme as well as a type of G-coupled protein receptor associated with cancer growth. Those drugs are small molecule inhibitors, rather than degraders.

The companies did not disclose how much Amgen is paying upfront.
