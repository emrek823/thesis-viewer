### Healthcare Data Exchange Challenges

- Data flow into providers remains problematic despite existing infrastructure
- Even top-tier health systems with Epic and CareEverywhere still rely on fax
- Large, unwieldy charts coming through Health Information Networks (HINs) are not practically useful for doctors
- Current solutions (including Health Information Exchanges - HIEs) are not effectively serving providers
- Layer Health briefly explored this space but determined it wasn’t viable

### Clinical Trial Opportunities in China

- Phase 1 and 2 trials in China offering significant advantages:
	- Costs approximately 1/4 of US trials
	- Speed approximately 4x faster than US
	- Growing credibility of Chinese trial data
	- Strong provider and patient participation rates
	- Tier-one health systems actively seeking trials
- Opportunity: Run phase 1 and 2 trials for US IND in China first
	- Bridge study required back in US
	- Focus on regulatory component and data transfer
	- Potential to lower barriers for early biotech companies

### International Second Opinion Market

- Opportunity identified in facilitating international second opinions
- Strong demand from international patients seeking US doctor consultations
- Potential unique distribution channel not yet fully exploited
- US doctors incentivized by institutions to seek additional revenue streams

### PE Company Disruption Opportunities

- PE healthcare companies constrained by existing economic models
- Unable to reduce customer costs without destroying revenue
- Opportunity for new entrants to:
	- Implement cost reductions through AI and automation
	- Change economic models
	- Compete through “self-cannibalization” approach

### Next Steps

- Emre to send relevant opportunities based on conversation
- Potential for future discussions on presented ideas
- Follow up on healthcare technology opportunities
