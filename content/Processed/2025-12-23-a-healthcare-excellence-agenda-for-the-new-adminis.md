In 2023 the United States federal government spent about [$1.5T on healthcare](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2024-budget-in-brief.pdf). It is the single biggest component of the federal budget: double the [$817B](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/FY2023-Defense-Budget/) allocated to defense, sixty times NASA’s [$26B](https://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdfs/FY2023-NASA-Budget-Request.pdf) budget, and about 100-fold more than the [$16B](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FY23%20BILL%20HIGHLIGHTS_DHS1.pdf) spent on securing our borders.

## Our healthcare system is not making us healthy

For $800B a year, America boasts the strongest military force on planet Earth. How much health does $1.5T buy us? One answer is “not enough”. Despite astronomical spending, by a number of measures America is actually getting sicker every year:

* **Obesity:** Chronic disease like obesity in American adults has gone from 13.5% in 1980 to [over 40%](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-adults-defined-as-obese?tab=chart&country=~USA) today.
* **Maternal mortality:** [Vastly more American mothers](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-maternal-mortality-rates-are-getting-worse-across-the-u-s/) are dying in childbirth today than in the Reagan era, despite advances in medical technology and investment in modern hospital facilities.
* **Drug overdoses:** Drug overdose deaths have grown by [more than tenfold](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/29/upshot/fentanyl-drug-overdose-deaths.html) since 1980. And in just the last decade, the rate of alcohol use deaths is [up 70%](https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-the-latest-alcohol-death-data-and-change-over-the-last-decade/).
* **Cancer in young adults:** The incidence of cancer in young Americans has alarmingly [climbed by 35%](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/cancer-young-people-doctors-baffled-49c766ed) since the mid 1980s.
* **Life expectancy:** Life expectancy has [barely improved](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/indicator/health-well-being/life-expectancy/#Life%20expectancy%20at%20birth,%20in%20years,%201980-2022) over a forty year period.

Now pick five friends at random and give them each a call. Ask each of them if they have had a bad experience with our healthcare system: a confusing bill, a primary care visit cut short by a busy doctor, or a situation where they have had to repeat, for the thirty-fourth time, their detailed medical history. You don’t need to make the calls, you say? You know the answers already?

Doctors don’t have it much better. Physicians leave medical school holding [$265k in debt](https://educationdata.org/average-medical-school-debt) before beginning years of earning less than minimum wage during residency. Endless documentation and compliance requirements drive many healthcare professionals to burnout.

## Our healthcare system is not affordable

You can probably guess that healthcare entitlements have been on the uptick, but you may not have guessed that they have been compounding at a blistering 8.5% annually for decades. This inexorable march upward is predicted to continue. Spending will reach [$4.7T in 2044](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60127#_idTextAnchor007) as our country continues to age.

Because 8.5% growth is much faster than the 2-3% growth of the economy and tax receipts, every year healthcare becomes a bigger component of the federal budget. It’s now rapidly approaching 30%.

In 2023 the United States ran a [$1.7T budget deficit](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59727). If we don’t touch healthcare and Social Security, this means finding $1.7T in savings from the $3.3T that remains. Are we going to cut defense, infrastructure, and support for veterans by half? If trends continue, by 2035 we would have to slash those areas by something like 60% to break even.

How much healthcare spending is too much? It’s a good question, but not one we can answer precisely. We can say that the current trajectory of healthcare entitlements will make it next to impossible to balance the budget. Another framing is that we’d have vastly more funding for space, science, and infrastructure if we got healthcare under control.

## Make America healthy again, inclusive of fiscal health

If we are currently on a path of increasing sickness and spending, the new administration has set forward healthcare priorities that will require us to chart a different course:

* **Maintain Our Promises to Society:** President Trump has [committed to maintaining and strengthening healthcare benefits](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/platform) for seniors, keeping the promise to society put forward in the Social Security Amendments of 1965 that established Medicare.
* **Tame Spending and Inflation:** President Trump has also committed to reining in federal spending and reducing inflation. Ballooning healthcare costs will make this goal extraordinarily challenging if not impossible if current trends continue.
* **Make America Healthy Again:** HHS secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made the inspiring call to Make America Healthy Again. America is the wealthiest and most innovative country on the planet – why should we not be the healthiest country too?

These are ambitious goals. How do we possibly get healthier and spend less money doing it?

Single payer solutions and government control favored by the left are no solutions at all. Moving to a monopsonist system like Canada is a recipe for strangling innovation and rationing access. Just ask our neighbors to the north who have to [wait a year for orthopedic surgery](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1864198417070620792). The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is [teetering on the brink of collapse](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2301257). We need to sort out some other way forward.

Other parts of the economy provide inspiration for what may actually work. In the realm of information technology, for example, fifty years has taken us from expensive four operation calculators to ubiquitous, free, artificial intelligence capable of passing the Turing Test. We can argue about the precise details but most of this miracle came from profit-seeking enterprises competing in a free market to deliver the best value for the buyer’s dollar.

We at 8VC believe that we can be healthier, happier, and more fiscally responsible if we take the same approach to healthcare. The only viable way to cut our Gordian knot is to harness American creativity and entrepreneurship to make healthcare vastly more productive.

## A healthcare excellence agenda for the new administration

Current regulations fail to create the right incentives, block entrepreneurship, and thwart our imperative to do more with less in American healthcare. According to HHS Deputy Secretary nominee Jim O’Neill:

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/635154aa7d0a29a9ed041ba2/6797be903301368a572b4a8d_AD_4nXcBGm2ICypbO_uBQh_Avn4XWL-EYjjcUmQlemmllW9KJko2zmJiYS0OSEQwqPNgmDoRW50jA-Dq6cBwtsNl5Dioik-NvD3tpnloThkWawaJLfvJhnDIzSlMzUN9Y0Jp3uzWLduO.png)

The new administration can enact reforms that will allow productivity-enhancing innovation in healthcare to be rewarded. In doing so we will unblock Americans from solving one of the most important problems our country faces. Tactically, we see opportunities in the following areas:

**1. Reform healthcare payments** - pay for value (i.e. health outcomes), not volume of work;

**2. Eliminate barriers to market entry** - open the door to new market entrants who will compete to produce the strongest health outcomes at the lowest cost;

**3. Liberate healthcare data** - allow all patients and healthcare providers to benefit from seamless sharing of health records;

**4. Accelerate scientific inquiry** - speed up research that will yield valuable new technologies and care models;

**5. Address fraud and abuse** - clean up areas where bad actors siphon off federal funds for personal benefit.

## 1. Reform healthcare payments

The government maintains a list of [tens of thousands of codes](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/physician-self-referral/list-cpt-hcpcs-codes) that describe all of the services that healthcare providers can offer along with prices that will be paid for those services. But innovations like [AI that can perform diabetic retinopathy screenings](https://www.digitaldiagnostics.com/products/eye-disease/lumineticscore/) may not have an assigned code and it may not be clear how newcomers can obtain one.

Another problem is that codes are aligned with a unit of work performed but not with the outcomes we seek: cured disease and healthier patients. It’s like if we paid contractors for every twist of a screwdriver or swing of the hammer but didn’t check if they built a house or a pile of rubble. We pay for the volume of work instead of value.

Payment reform is one of the biggest levers we have for incentivizing American innovators to solve the important problem of making more Americans healthier with less spending.

#### **1.A. Reduce the conflicted role of the AMA in determining payments [CMS]**

One problem with service codes is that they are [largely defined by](https://www.ama-assn.org/about/cpt-editorial-panel/cpt-code-process) the physicians’ advocacy group - The American Medical Association (AMA). The AMA also [sets the prices](https://www.ama-assn.org/about/rvs-update-committee-ruc) that government will pay for those services. This is an obvious conflict of interest: should we ask the radiologists if and how much we should pay for AI radiology? And adding insult to injury, the AMA charges CMS annual licensing fee that could exceed $100M for the use of these service codes.

We support HHS secretary nominee RFK Jr.’s proposal to [reduce the role of the AMA in determining what CMS pays for and the prices it will pay](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2024/12/02/rfkjr-medicare-payments). Physicians should be stakeholders in determining what medical services can be paid and what a reasonable price should be. But making the AMA arbiter of codes and prices does not make sense, and paying handsomely for the privilege does not either.

#### **1.B. Create a pathway for healthcare AI evaluation and reimbursement [FDA, CMS]**

Autonomous AI is or soon will be capable of offering many of the same services as medical professionals: e.g. interpreting imaging and pathology studies, delivering therapy, offering second opinions, and routine medication management. These technologies have the potential to radically expand access to care for Medicare and especially Medicaid beneficiaries. But what review processes will the FDA require? And what reimbursement will be available from CMS? The opaque regulatory risk and unknown rewards make it challenging for investors to fund healthcare AI.

The FDA should [expand the TAP program](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/total-product-life-cycle-advisory-program-tap/tap-overview) to facilitate the development of healthcare AI as a top national priority. Approval requirements should focus on showing similar performance and safety to human clinicians. CMS should coordinate with FDA to establish clear reimbursement codes and rates that are accessible immediately upon FDA approval which can be refined as real world evidence demonstrates value to taxpayers and beneficiaries. The [Transitional Coverage for Emerging Technologies](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/final-notice-transitional-coverage-emerging-technologies-cms-3421-fn) (TCET) could possibly be expanded to serve these purposes, or CMS could publish rates for particular AI capabilities as “bounties” for entrepreneurs.

More important than the specific means is a clear, coordinated solution sitting across FDA and CMS that accelerates the development of high value healthcare AI.

#### **1.C. Expand Direct Primary Care payment models [CMS]**

CMS supports a number of programs that pay primary care providers not using service codes but a fixed monthly capitated fee – much like a subscription – that covers a bundle of services such as routine and preventative care, referrals, coordination, medication refills, and more for empaneled patients. This payment mechanism is often called Direct Primary Care (DPC). Certain payme
