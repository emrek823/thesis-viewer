## Slide 3: The Problem

# RIGHT.
The Problem
The increasing volume and complexity of clinical trials is crippling existing antiquated systems

66,000 recruiting
studies and growing

Many trials compete for
the same patients

Studies are more
complex and take longer

### Chart: Number of Registered Studies Over Time

| Year | Number of Registered Studies |
|---|---|
| 2000 | 0 |
| 2006 | ~100,000 |

| 2018 | ~350,000 |
| 2024 (as of 2024-05-10) | ~475,000 |

*Data point:* 44% Are in the US (referring to the total registered studies)

*Image Description:* Three icons representing the problems:
1. A line graph showing increasing registered studies, with a highlighted area indicating "44% Are in the US".
2. Three stylized human figures, implying multiple trials competing for the same patients.
3. A person next to a large clock, indicating studies are more complex and take longer.
