# Ambience Healthcare, Inc. - Director at Mayo Clinic
Interview conducted on May 02, 2025

## Topics
Specialty Models, Integration, Epic Integration, Primary Care, Vendor Evaluation, Pilot Phase, Provider Education, Coding Suggestions

## Summary
The conversation between the Tegus Client and the expert centered on evaluating AI scribing tools in the healthcare industry, specifically Abridge and Ambience, for their integration with EMR systems, specialty-specific models, and impact on coding and billing. The expert emphasized the importance of addressing gaps in subspecialties, streamlining documentation processes, and reducing administrative burden for healthcare providers. The discussion also touched on the challenges and benefits of integrating Ambience with Epic compared to Abridge, as well as the ongoing evaluation of different vendors for note generation. The decision to consolidate onto one vendor was not imminent, as each tool offered unique features and capabilities catering to different needs within the healthcare system.

## Expert Details
Director at Mayo Clinic. The expert is currently a paying customer of Ambience Healthcare and Abridge.

Director at Mayo Clinic. The expert is responsible for the advancement of patient-centered automation and AI solutions that align with Mayo Clinic's Bold Forward strategy, setting strategic direction and tactical roadmaps to enhance operational performance. Prioritizes measurable outcomes that improve both organizational efficiency and patient care across the enterprise in close collaboration with cross-functional teams.

The expert can speak to advanced analytics, EMR, Automation, and RPA Gen AI. The expert is familiar with many of the major SaaS companies and their products.

Client
Thanks for hopping on the call. We're just trying to get up to speed on the ambient scribing space. Particularly want to learn about Abridge, Ambience, DAX, and how you think about positioning between those companies. Given you're a customer of both Ambience and Abridge, it looks like, love to get your thoughts on how your experience has been with both of them. Ask you a bunch of questions around how you thought about the adoption process, who you evaluated, how you ended up picking them, how well they work, differences between the two platforms, bunch of different things that we want to talk about.

Expert
Yeah, it does. I could probably also talk a little bit about Suki and DAX as well. There's a presence there too, just so you know.

Client
Yeah. Suki. Now, we've heard of a couple others as well. Our perception is that it's DAX/Nuance and Abridge have a lot of the market share, and Ambience is maybe a third biggest player. We can talk about your perception of the market as well. I would love to hear your thoughts around Suki and some of the other players too. To get us kicked off though, I think it would be helpful to just get a couple minutes on your background and your role at Mayo Clinic. As part of that too, it'd be helpful to hear about maybe your history around scribing if you guys use human scribes before, what the lay of the land was prior to adopting Ambience and Abridge.

---

## Expert
Absolutely. There's definitely what is represented on the external platforms and internal. I'm very much on the administrative side, supporting our traditional dyad relationship with clinician leadership. I've been working on this side for about 20 years now, primarily in the AI analytics, automation, gen AI space as it's emerged. Traditionally, I would say, again, anywhere from providers doing their documentation prior to this technology on their own after hours, we also did have medical scribes that helped out with this in various areas, the higher-volume spaces like GI and cardiology, areas like that.

Again, our journey started with this a number of years ago as we started to explore different players in the market and test them out. Presently, now, there's pilots with DAX, Suki, Abridge, and Ambience in different spaces at different degrees of scale and for different reasons, I think, based on just the general experience that we've had with the different tools.

## Client
Got it. Maybe we start talking about the initial adoption process. You guys want a formal RFP. How do you hear about Ambience, Abridge, all the other players? It'd be helpful to go back as early in time as you think is helpful. This is 2022, 2023 timeframe we're talking about. Just maybe take us back to prior to using anything, what it looked like for you guys internally and how you were making notes and how you ultimately decided to adopt one of these AI scribing tools.

## Expert
Yeah. There's a significant amount of time that goes into doing all of this post-visit note generation. Nursing notes is also in that component, and, of course, just the piece of inpatient as well. When this started coming on the scene, we went through our standard evaluation channels, through the soft RFP process involving ventures and our business development area to do a lot of that market scan research to see, evaluate to in that soft analysis of what might make the most sense giving our landscape internal. After that going into different conversations with different vendors on where we could potentially pilot this, where the ease of entry was.

That was determined probably not a big surprise to be in the general internal med primary care space where a lot of these players initially, I think, have seen success both in smaller and larger scales. We followed suit similarly to just our research and what we saw as a good entry point and, again, similarly saw a lot of success in that space in primary care and GIM before we started looking at some of the other specialties with the tools.

That's where, again, as we honed in on those initial insights and results, we were able to see some of the opportunities for improvement based on the output, where we would still require the physician to go in and edit or modify the notes. We also saw some of that when we started experimenting or piloting in some of the specialty areas where, again, the notes.

## Client
Maybe taking a step back. Can we talk about the RFP process? You are the executive director of intelligent automation and AI at Mayo Clinic. It'd be helpful to understand who else is on the team. Who is the team that was running the RFP process? Who is involved? Who are the main stakeholders? Were you the main decision-maker here, or give us a sense, was the CFO involved, CIO, chief medical officer? Just give us a sense of the actual RFP process.

## Expert
Yeah. Definitely not the sole decision-maker by any means. There's an actual program that's around this in our organization that consists of our clinical support systems. We have the IT branch that supports that. There's considerations from the system of record that we use and the integration that would be required or preferred. We have representation from IT, clinical systems, clinical leadership, business development, all those different groups. They're all different shared services groups that were part of that.

## Client
You guys come together as a committee. When was the timeframe when you guys started doing this soft RFP process?

---

## Expert
In terms of how many years ago?

## Client
Yeah, 2022, 2023. Just take us back there.

## Expert
Yeah, it was 2023 timeframe when it was the discovery requirements gathering and market scan and vendor shortlisting. That was about the timeframe that we started before the official RFP took place. Again, that was around the 2023 and some of it into 2024 too timeframe, because as I said, there's more than one layer in the market.

## Client
Yeah. How did you guys go about the process of shortlisting? How did you ultimately come across? Currently, customers of ambient debated. It sounds like based on your screening response, you're obviously aware of some of the other players too. It'd just be helpful if you can walk us through how you came across different players and what were the different things you did prior to the actual RFP process as part of the vendor shortlisting.

## Expert
Yeah. It was a requirements gathering exercise where we initially were looking at what our pain points were to address. The documentation burden, some of the accuracy notes that would contribute to downstream, circle back for education from a billing coding perspective, the provider burnout aspect where they call pajama time, all this time where they're doing all this type of work.

From that, we were looking at what were our goals with these tools. Admin time reduction, number one, but coding optimization, integration with our EMR and then support for specialties and then just support in general, I think. Again, that was where we had the stakeholder group that I was referring to around clinical leadership, IT rep cycle, compliance, provider champions.

In that vein, that's really what we used to shortlist throughout the course of our market scan to say like, "These are the areas that align with our core use cases and the pain points problems we were trying to solve in that primary specialty care."

## Client
Makes sense. Admin time reduction was number one. The other things you mentioned like coding time reduction, integration with the EMR, support for specialties, those are also important considerations. Those are the main categories.

## Expert
Absolutely, because some of the tools, while they work well, it's choppy. If you have a good ambient tool, but then you got to copy this and paste it here, versus having their modules have full integration and trigger within the EMR, they're approving things, but then it drops right into the EMR seamlessly. You're replacing some of the administrative steps with other administrative steps. If they don't have that type of full integration, there's still going to be that kind of clunky process that you're replacing it with. That was a big one for sure.

## Client
That's helpful. Now, maybe it'd be helpful if you can tell us how you settled on Ambience and Abridge ultimately, but take us through the rest of the process and how you started going down different vendors.

---

## Expert
Yeah. I should clarify. There isn't really a subtle on any of them. The four that I mentioned before are all in the environment, and they're being used where we see success. We're still evaluating quite a bit as it relates to that. There's been success as an example with Abridge in terms of the primary care implementation from an Ambience perspective. There's offerings that they have that, again, we're seeing opportunity in some of the more nuanced specialty circumstances. That's also because they have specialty-specific models. There's other reasons why there's also appeal, I think, as it relates to that.

Abridge has done a great job in the primary care space because the notes are, for lack of a better term, fairly generic. It's hitting the nail on the head in terms of what that needs to do on the primary care side. There is some experience that we've seen in some of the specialty spaces where there's a lot of correction that needs to take place after the note's generated. You're getting the response from the provider base that it's taking more time for me to put the requirement that needs to be in my note than it is to just generate the note myself.

That's where we're looking at, "Okay, what specialties work outside of internal med primary care in an Abridge-type scenario? Which specialties are we seeing success there? What gaps do we need to fill with other tools like Ambience?" As you can probably see in your evaluation, most likely Ambience also has the downstream CPT code, HCC capture coding assistant work that's also integrated into EMRs. That's also a big factor.

That has downstream impact both on the provider education side where the note is suggesting or assisting the provider on the coding billing side to accurately reflect the note that was generated.

That's something that is appealing too because while it's great that we're reducing that admin burden in the sense with some of these tools, the selling point, I think, on tools like Ambience that have the billing coding assistance, we're not just generating a note and then having the provider go in and have to go through dropping charges and billing appropriately. We're also going down further using the same insight to more accurately reflect the codes.

Also, something being looked at is the inpatient side. I think there's two or three specialties now, but the critical care element, so the ability for it to look at the output of the note and say, "I'm flagging these three bullets in your dictation as indicators. It looks like you perform critical care," and then it can flash up that timer to say, "Let's record your time."

In the critical care scenario, sometimes they intermittently enter different times as a provider for a certain episode. There's certain requirements for how much time that you need to enter to be able to bill for. In the manual sense, if you're doing it and it's a little bit more disjointed, you may not hit the mark to be able to bill for that cumulative set of segments. That type of a feature also is something that could be quite valuable because it's potential loss revenue if we're not syncing up across the board with reporting out on that critical care element.

Suki is one of those other ones where it's easier when you're traveling or there's more mobile activity going on. Some of those pilots in that realm of Suki is offering some potential application in those spaces where, again, you're not in a stationary room, but you're moving around a lot. Home health could be an option there too that we've talked about.

## Client
Got it. I think we want to focus on Ambience and Abridge to start, and if you have time, we can talk about the others. Just to clarify, you are currently still in the pilot phase for all of these guys. You're still evaluating. You haven't decided to consolidate on one vendor.

## Expert
No, that is true.

## Client
Okay. How long have you been piloting each of them?

---

## Expert
Abridge has been a year and a half, couple years now. Ambience, probably more so in the six month timeline. I'd say Suki and Nuance are similar to Abridge timeline as well. Those three got tested about the same timeframe.

## Client
Why did you bring in Ambience? It sounds like a year into when you were using Abridge and Suki and Nuance, you decided to bring in Ambience as the newest one. Why bring them in?

## Expert
Yeah. Apart from the fact that it's a pretty standard practice for us to put more than one horse in the race in these instances, I'd say with Abridge specifically, there was success in the initial rollout or, as I said, like the primary care internal med opportunity, that it obviously made sense to provide access to as many providers in that domain as we could. That scaled rather rapidly.

The other thing to note, I think about the vendors that were selected is all of them are not difficult to integrate. If I go back to the integration component, we selected those for a purpose to be able to seamlessly plug in with our EMR. With all of them, it's very simple. There's a very low lift for our administrators on the EMR side to set this up and then make it available for providers.

In addition to the configuration and then the training and change management element, for any of them, it's not really a huge lift. When we piloted these going back to Abridge and we saw that initial success, then we just started turning it on and activating more licenses and deploying that. It was just very clear we had a scale opportunity, the fact that it's just not that hard to scale in the traditional software sense.

I've supported other deployments or homegrown or vendor-related deployments or even the EMR administrative changes. This is something that takes on the administrative side for our EMR. It could be 60 hours' worth of work before it's configured, and then it's just an access game after that. We wanted to make sure that these providers that, again, where we had a clear practical application and enough success, enough adoption to just deploy that as quickly as we could to see that efficiency gain.

## Client
Yeah. We definitely want to talk about the integrations and Epic integrations in more depth. The point of my question was did you notice any deficiencies with Abridge that led you to bring in Ambience, or was it just because you wanted to evaluate more than one vendor because it's standard practice? Part of the question is a year and a half is a long time to be piloting. I'm just curious why you haven't selected a vendor yet and why bring in Ambience after you've already started using Abridge.

## Expert
Yeah. Again, I think there's noticeable gaps in all of them. I had mentioned that there are certain areas that have high adoption with Abridge as an example, and some that don't have the same level. I think that's one opportunity now as the rapid scale has slowed down to say, "Well, in those spaces where we see opportunities and there is lower adoption, do we want to trial something else?" There's the access that we've given everyone, and then there is the utilization rate.

## Client
Yeah. Can we specify this actually with Abridge? What specialties did you notice lower rates of utilization and retention? If you can quantify that in any sense, you looked at retention was X percent after 90 days, or however you guys track it. Can you be a little more specific on where the gaps were in Abridge and if you were trying to address those with Ambience?

## Expert
Yeah. I can give you some examples. In neurology, cardiology, GI, it's not the full specialty, but it's some of the subspecialty spaces where we saw lower utilization. Those are some of the areas where we are considering a tool like Ambience because they have specialty-specific models. That is where we saw some of

---

the drop-off. I don't have the exact utilization rates for those at the top of my head, but it's lower compared to, again, some of their colleagues in certain specialties and then of course compared to the primary care.

## Client
Got it. Basically, part of the idea was Ambience has specialty-specific models, and you think they'd be better able to address some of those gaps. Have you seen that so far in the six months that Ambience has generated better notes and resulted in better retention and utilization within some of those hub specialties?

## Expert
We have. The added benefit of the coding element and billing element. We've pulled in revenue cycle to monitor that. They got historical data related to provider billing and coding and the provider education component. We've definitely seen some changes there as well. The adoption has been consistent now, and it's been positive where we have looked at this. With six months, it's still a little early to tell, I would say, because we are still on the pilot phase, but we are seeing positive results up to this point.

## Client
Got it. I definitely want to talk about the coding and billing piece. I definitely want to talk about integrations. Those are probably some of the next topics. Before we get there, you guys have now been piloting different tools for a year and a half. At what point do you think you'll have enough information? Or at what point do you think you'll make the decision to consolidate onto one vendor, if you would do that?

Do you think there's a path where you use multiple vendors and you use Abridge for ambulatory and primary care, then maybe nursing down the line? You use Ambience for certain things. I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about. You are guys using three different vendors. I'm just curious if you eventually plan to consolidate.

## Expert
Yeah. That's a good question. At the point we're at right now, I think that consolidation to one vendor is not really something that is on anyone's mind. I think that it seems like there's going to be application across the board for a couple of vendors at the current state. One of the things that I would say there's more conversation with the partners that we have, how do we create support across the board for the areas where we're seeing success with one versus the other?

The other thing I would say is I think we're very acute aware of the fact that when you talk about if I just say Ambience versus Abridge, these tools all have different features. Some support some specialties better than others. Again, we're trying to fill those gaps. There's other capabilities that one has that the other one doesn't.

The billing, coding, orders support, things like that, Ambience has that feature. Abridge doesn't. Abridge has a little bit more integration with our EMR than Ambience does right now. There's a lot of pros and cons there. Again, in that vein of integration, there's pros and cons for that, that we have to consider as we're looking at deploying multiple models in our system. That's something we're addressing as we bring these groups in. I know you have integration questions, so I won't go deeper than that.

## Client
Let's talk about integration. You guys are using Epic, I assume?

## Expert
Yep.

## Client
Okay, maybe a question to start off. You're probably aware of this, but Nuance and Abridge are design partners of Epic, and Ambience isn't. Maybe to start off, we go chronologically. Was that a reason why you initially didn't look at Ambience and why you piloted Abridge earlier?

---

## Expert
Yeah. I think that's one of the reasons. Ambience is pretty close. They have near full integration with Epic. As an Epic client, whenever we look at vendors, they've got their App Orchard or whatever they're calling it now. I think it has a different name, but we always look to that because we know they're going to be better partners as we work with Epic and all of our technical support and things like that. That was one reason. It wasn't the only reason.

Now that Ambience has ramped up on that to the most part and we're putting pressure, I think, on them as much as others are to get that full Epic integration check mark, there are some of those other hoops that we have to jump through in the manual sense. Definitely, it was a consideration.

## Client
Got it. What were the initial gaps in the integrations with Ambience and Epic initially, and how long did it take for it to get the parity with the Epic and Abridge integration?

## Expert
I think about a month. I think that some of the setbacks were, again, just how the note seamlessly integrates with the EMR. When I talked about some of that copy-paste stuff in the past, that was one of the vendors where you had to do that basically. It wasn't triggering something that was integrated with our EMR where you could review the pop-up module through the ambient tool and then approve the note and have that actually go and post to the chart. That was one piece.

Also, just how you deploy the tool, there's certain newer and older ways to give access to providers with this tool. There's a broader profile design that you can do in Epic, that tools, like, I think, Nuance and Abridge offer that in the Ambience realm, as they get closer to full integration, they're going to do that too. The way they're doing it now is using this allow list, which would require you to maintain this list and give access to each individual provider to a tool versus deploy the model or have them to be able to deploy it through what they call their Suki app in Epic, where it's just launching the model.

Those are big hard stops for us as we just talked about, "Well, we already are in a multi-vendor environment. We want to create a seamless way for them to be able to use one model versus another." One of the roadblocks we hit with the current model was you could only deploy one vendor or another in the department.

If I go back to that, this works for one subspecialty under a specialty department umbrella, but maybe not another. From a vendor comparison perspective, if there's a gap and you want to bring another vendor into that space, we were essentially left with the choice of, "Well, you either choose this one for the whole department, or you choose that one." We were talking to other healthcare systems on how they did it. Cleveland Clinic as an example. Their build was structured in Epic in a different way so that you could trigger one model versus another. That's another thing.

If we do end up living in this multi-vendor environment, we don't obviously want to pigeonhole ourselves in a department where it's just guaranteed that some subspecialties aren't going to use an ambient technology. That's not the world we want to live in. We are comparing to other clients as well on the Epic side to see how they've managed that and migrating towards that as we scale these different tools.

## Client
How much custom work did you guys need to do to get Ambience integrated with Epic? Basically, how much of a benefit is it out of the box that Abridge is a design partner with Epic? Maybe put a different way. Mayo Clinic has a lot of resources and technical expertise. You mentioned it wasn't that difficult. The integration is, it didn't take that long to set up and it was easy for you guys.

The question is around how difficult is it? How many other health systems have the capabilities to do that, given you guys are a major health system? How difficult would it be for other people who aren't the size and scale and have the expertise of Mayo Clinic?

---

## Expert
Yeah. I think the larger systems like the Clevelands, Mayos, Johns Hopkins definitely have an advantage to make a choice, for example, to go with a multi-vendor approach in the ambient space. We do have a larger bench of support as it relates to customizing an Epic.

Personally, I feel like if I was a smaller system, number one, the likelihood is going to decrease that they're just going to have the ability to choose a whole bunch of different vendors to play with because there's the financial aspect of it. Also, it's a possibility that they wouldn't have the ability to manage or maintain a system where they'd be able to trigger multiple ambient technologies at the same time that we are essentially doing in our environment.

## Client
Do you have a preference for your physicians to do everything within the Haiku app versus doing it with an Ambience's app? It'd be helpful to get your perspective on the capabilities that you can do natively within Ambience's own app versus what you can do within Epic and within Haiku.

## Expert
Yeah. I think part of the reason that Ambience is more on their app side is because of that fact. The capabilities, I think, do offer a little bit more in the sense of triggering the Ambience app versus what you can do with Epic. I think that's also because they're not fully integrated with Epic. That is something, again, that we're pushing on from an Ambience perspective.

## Client
How important is that to you guys as an organization, maybe not to you directly, but to other stakeholders like the CIO or the CFO or whoever's making the ultimate decision for you guys to adopt one of these vendors? How important is it to have everything done within Haiku?

## Expert
I think it's fairly important because, again, that's usually touting the fact that it's got the Epic integration component. Again, it was a big push that we had right out of the gate, and we started talking with them where just some of that capability that existed in the Ambience Healthcare app is something that we would just want to be natively available and integrated with the Haiku app.

I think it is probably one of those big check marks for us. I think every vendor that we talked to, we were weighing the pros and cons of triggering their model through Haiku versus the Epic app. It always ran into what capabilities would we lose relative to your integration, the coding suggestions. I think right now you would lose in the Haiku app some of the pre-charting or patient summary. That's why we're pushing them pretty hard right now to get those last pieces fixed.

There are some other alternatives that we are looking at with our Epic technical support as well to make sure that we have those features. To some degree, especially those coding suggestions in the billing aspect, that's a big sell on the ambient side. If we're being told, like, "You know, if you don't use our app, you use the Haiku app," that all those features go away, then the allure for Ambience, it downgrades the rating in our mind to some degree.

## Client
Yeah. We should talk about that piece, actually. Maybe we'll come back to some of the other questions I had on integration, but maybe since we're talking about this now, one of the things we've heard is that Epic is working on their own internal version of all these coding and billing suggestions and all the RCM functionality that Ambience currently offers.

One, I'd like to just get your reaction to that. Maybe I'll pose a hypothetical to you. If Epic comes out, Ambience has these things available right now, you're happy with them, you think they're adding value, you're seeing apples in revenue. It's all great. If Epic comes to you and six months, 12 months down the line, they say, "We can do all the same things now in terms of coding support and billing and RCM functionality,

---

and we'll give it to you for free," did that change your calculus on the ranking of the scoring of Ambience, given that you said that this is a major part of why you guys think they're valuable?

## Expert
Yeah, it certainly could. I think that's a component of it. The other thing is going to be the long game on adoption for broad specialty application. Success in primary care, that's great. That's a big chunk that we covered. There's also varying degrees of success across specialties, the subspecialties. There's not the complete adoption rate that we would look for. We're constantly evaluating all the specific specialty models that Ambience has.

If I go back to the long-term strategy conversation I mentioned before, we're not at the place where we're deciding what ultimately would be the single vendor in our space. Where we're at right now is there's application for a number of vendors because of where we see some gaps across the board that we're trying to fill.

Do we anticipate that a lot of this will normalize from the big players because they're acutely aware of where they fall short and where some of the other vendors offer features like this? Yes. If you look at the long term, would we want to adopt Epic's AI powered coding capabilities down the road? Absolutely. Would the decision also be contingent upon the fact that we would need broad coverage and support and adoption across the board from primary care, specialty, subspecialty standpoint? That's still going to be a factor because that's still contributing to the overall quality of the note generation.

Whatever we're feeding into Epic's future coding model, the quality needs to be there where we're saying, "Yep, if we're going down the one vendor pathway, we don't want to have the providers to have to do a lot of rework before it gets to that step."

## Client
Yeah. I'm thinking about this as Ambience versus Abridge thing. I think one of the things you alluded to is that Abridge doesn't offer the same coding and billing feature functionality that Ambience does today. My hypothetical I'm posing to you is in a scenario where, let's say down the line, the gap between specialties that you guys are experiencing today with Ambience and Abridge that shrinks, call it 50%, 75% to a point where it's not a huge gap.

You're still seeing similar rates of utilization retention within subspecialties with Abridge as you are in Ambience. Maybe the physicians don't like the platform as much. It's not entirely comparable, but it's close enough. If they reach parity there and then let's say Abridge, because it has the Epic partnership, even though they're not offering the same level of coding and billing features today with Epic, down the line, Epic offers those things anyway. They eventually reach close to parity with what Ambience offers.

The question is, in that case, what is the value of Ambience to you if you ultimately get to a point where you get subspecialty coverage from Abridge and you also get the coding and billing downstream features from Epic? Where would you see value of Ambience? Right now, you're saying that you can justify multiple vendors because you see the gaps. Basically, what happens if Abridge and Epic address those gaps in both ends? Where does Ambience fit in for you?

## Expert
Yeah. I think the appeal to that solution, I would, again, in the future state where they reach parity in that regard, I don't think there would be as much of a strong case to have another vendor like that in the system. That's what the assumption, I think, that you laid out.

## Client
That's helpful. Maybe as part of this, it'd be helpful to maybe dive a little bit deeper into what extent you see a difference. I know I've talked about this a little bit already, but on the specialty side, how big of a delta is there today between Abridge and Ambience? I know you mentioned that you're seeing some benefit in terms of utilization and retention. Just trying to get order of magnitude. Is this something that today it's a massive difference? Have you noticed any indication from Abridge when you have spoken to them that they're working

---

to address this? Help us understand how big of a difference there is today.

## Expert
Yeah. It's somewhat of a challenging question to answer. Ambient, I should talk, GI, cardiology, they claim to support 100+ specialties. Abridge is more talking about being optimized for primary care, GIM, behavioral health, ambulatory subspecialties. Those are the homes that they live in. We're seeing success where we've piloted it in the GI, cardiology, some of the neurosurgery space with Ambience where we haven't had to do as much rework.

Abridge is certainly seeing these gaps and addressing them. There's been a lot of feedback on some of the, again, ambulatory subspecialties where they have had challenges and they've responded to those. Throughout the course of our partnership, it's like we're working alongside to address those versus in some of the places where Ambience has been deployed, those models already exist.

The reason it's a challenging question, apart from the feedback I just gave, is there's more of a presence with Abridge than Ambience right now. It's hard to say in a comparative model. There's been success in the gaps we've addressed, but there's a greater presence in utilization. Abridge has been around longer.

## Client
Maybe within those specialties like GI, cardiology where you're using Ambience, were those subspecialties where you previously used Abridge weren't satisfied and then brought in Ambience? If you can help us understand the sequencing of this, that would be helpful.

## Expert
Yep. That's what it was where broad-scale access was given, and you had broad provider, pilot and interaction and testing and then essentially came back to look at the utilization rates. You got the commentary from the providers. I can give one example. This is a feature too, I would say right now, one of the comparative differences between the two tools.

Abridge doesn't link their note to the appointment diagnosis. That's something that you have to do. That means when you go through the process of using the tool in the patient interaction, let's say you have someone coming in with the appointment diagnosis of Parkinsonism, and then they go into the appointment, and they say, "I have tremors." Tremors is one of the conditions related to that diagnosis. You go back to the note before you post it and it's just, "I have tremors." It doesn't have the associated appointment diagnosis that's not going to pass an audit.

Ambience does do that linkage to the note. When it looks at that appointment diagnosis and then leverages their specialty model, it completes that full circle. Those are some of the things you get in the commentary with some of those more nuanced specialty areas where they're saying like, "Yeah, I can't submit it this way. I got to go back in and layer in all that diagnosis-related information to connect to the symptoms that were described." That's some of the experience that we saw in the places where we were filling those gaps and one of those core challenges that we saw on the Abridge side.

## Client
That makes sense. I want to jump back to some of the coding and billing features too. With Ambience, can you just tell us a little about what those features look like for you guys today? Have you noticed an uptick in revenue generated from your positions?

Also, by the way, one thing we've also heard is the uptick in revenue is inherently one time in nature. If you're currently a position and you're coding at level three, and then using the additional support and documentation that you get from Ambience as coding features, you can now fill out level four or five. That's a one-time thing. It is not going to continue to uplift from there. That is an aside. Just curious to get your reactions on that. Also, just hear about your current usage of the coding products and if you guys have noticed that uplift in ROI yet, the uplifted revenue.

## Expert

---

Yeah. We have definitely noticed it. Again, because you're comparing against your baselines for historical E&M as well as the providers that the coding team has to reach out from a provider education audit perspective. We have noticed that uptick. Again, we don't have that much data yet to give a cumulative answer, but we have noticed that.

To your point, it's a one-time deal, but it's based on every episode. You are looking at the overall volume, types of interventions that we've had to do in the past. Also, just looking from a departmental standpoint, are we seeing a difference in coding relative to the baselines, the bell curves had in the past? Also, as a result, are we seeing any variation from downstream revenue? We have noticed that there has definitely been a change there. It's been slight up to this point, but there is a quantifiable difference.

## Client
Yeah, so it's quantified. Again, it's still early, but okay. I'll have a question on ROI later, but that's helpful. Can you also just talk through some maybe specific examples of besides the coding suggestions, what are the different RCM? I know you mentioned pre-charting as well. What are all the different adjacent products that you're using with Ambience today?

## Expert
We are using the coding assistant, the CPT code assistant, I believe it's called. The point of care coding piece as well as just the overall E&M auditable trail, how the code was derived, supporting compliance, downstream billing workflows, the specialty-aware documentation. There's a little bit that we have plugged in around the compliance intelligence. Medical necessity, language, code justification, helping with documentation, completeness, coding accuracy monitoring, that piece too. We're leveraging all the features that we can. I think it pretty much covers the extent of their platform.

## Client
Before I get into that, I realized I didn't ask this upfront. What is the extent of the usage across your entire base of physicians, across Abridge, Ambience? If you can quantify this somehow, you have X number of physicians, Y number of specialties. You have Abridge deployed in primary care, internal med, and that covers the number of physicians, and then you have Ambience in these subspecialties, it covers, however, many physicians in there. Give us a sense of how widely each of these tools are being deployed today.

## Expert
Yeah. Abridge takes the cake as it relates to that. There's in the thousands for that. It covers pretty much all the outpatient specialties and primary care. Ambience is much smaller. It's in the hundreds, I would say. It's in those areas I mentioned before with GI, cardiology, neurology.

## Client
Got it. I just wanted to clarify super quickly. I know that you're still in pilot phase, but if you had to go live with them, let's say, in the next month, and you guys were comfortable with going live with two providers, what do you think the split would be? Is it 80/20, 90/10, Abridge to Ambience? I know it's a pilot, so probably not all the physicians are using it, but let's say you decided to go with it, everyone got a license. What's the long-term live split, if you had to guess?

## Expert
Yeah, probably 80/20, Abridge Ambience.

## Client
All good. The question I want to ask just at a higher level is there's clearly a lot more usage on Abridge. I'm not trying to lead you to a horse here, but I just want to get your thoughts around this. If you're 80% of the usage is on Abridge, they're working on closing the gap in subspecialties. Let's say they get there. Ultimately, let's say that you can get some of the similar benefits of the coding suggestions from Epic offering that natively.

---

I'm asking a similar question what I was saying before, but it's the use case today for ambient pretty much. Putting the coding aside, it's pretty much restricted to these three subspecialties that you mentioned today, GI, cardiology, neurology. My reaction to that is it seems very limited compared to what you guys are doing with Abridge. That goes to the question of if you had to pick eventually to consolidate to, where would you lean towards?

## Expert
Yeah. It does have to do with the specialty element. There are still gaps that need to be addressed. There's still a roadmap for where we want to test that out with Ambience, where, again, the Abridge mass deployment has found its spaces of adoption. There's work being done to some degree on where there's lower adoption.

There's also the testing with Ambience in terms of if those specialty-specific models have more success in those areas where we've seen lower adoption with Abridge. It's somewhat dependent on that. Again, we haven't really filled in all those gaps. Both of these tools are still being actively deployed. I don't know if I hit the completeness of your question. If you could jump back and tell me what.

## Client
That's helpful. I'm just trying to get your thoughts around how you think about continued justification of using both. Go ahead.

## Expert
I was just going to say the jury's still out on some of those other specialty models on the ambient side. We're seeing success in filling some of those gaps after looking at utilization rates with Abridge. If you go back to that coding conversation, again, if these groups both normalize and support more broadly across the board, it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out long term. There would be less of a justification for one versus the other if the note generation hits the mark between the two of them and then Epic comes out with the coding billing piece, and we don't have to evaluate vendors from that perspective anymore.

## Client
One question. If I were just to flip that on its head. Abridge covers outpatient and primary care all well, and Ambience is just GI, cardiology, neurology for the most part, in terms of utilization. If Ambience can cover all the more basic physician stuff, the non-specialties as well as Abridge, why would people like yourself just not standardize on Ambience? It seems like Ambience and Abridge are pretty similar, but Ambience just goes further with medical coding. If you ignore that, they also go further in the specialty models. Why would you not just consolidate on the one that can do the generic stuff and then also the specialty stuff? Is it price?

## Expert
I don't think it is yet, but that certainly could become a factor down the road. There are definitely conversations this leadership is having around. It's another good reason in at least the current state and in the current landscape, having multiple partners, because again, as we start to normalize and look at that question, there's different levers that we can pull based on the pricing opportunity. I don't think that is necessarily a factor at the moment, but down the road, again, as we start to see this normalize a little bit more is definitely something that I think we'll be looking at, and it's definitely something that's being talked about right now.

## Client
Got it. Let me see here. My final question. As we think about this market, there's a handful of different players. Is there anything that you think we should be asking that we haven't or maybe any interesting questions or, I don't know, concepts that other investors have asked you on previous expert calls that we have not?

## Expert
No. I think you hit the mark with most of it. I think the big things to summarize, especially with big players in

---

the market, the Clevelands of the world, it's going to be important to see how the integration works with a tool like Epic. The other thing I would say about Epic is, yes, they come out with functionality all the time. Sometimes, it hits the mark.

With these bigger players, we all have very nuanced, very specific differences in terms of how we operate. I can tell you in the space that I work in, we're building homegrown point solutions to supplement where a tool like Epic is just too generic for our primary specialty tertiary care models. It's great that they're coming out with a feature. I've lived long enough in this environment with a tool like Epic to know it's cool that they say this is coming, how great it's going to be when it's released, relative to where we could apply it in our environment right away.

That remains to be seen. I've been impressed and also underwhelmed with these types of things that they've come out with. It's also challenging for them to meet the needs across the board with their broad client base compared to a vendor that's specifically focused on certain things like this. I think that's going to be important to watch to say like, "Well, if Epic comes up with this natively, great. Where can we use it?" There's still going to be a gap.

Most likely, when they first come out with it, there will be gaps. That's just a given. I think at least things get released. I think that's important. Again, the long-term integration with a tool like Epic is going to be important too. Price will definitely be a factor.

One other thing I would say is access to the data. These vendors are also looking at how we're using these notes. There's a lot of practical applications beyond the use case that we talked about today and using these notes in the form of education, research. The bigger players are going to want access to this. These vendors are seeing this is also a money making opportunity where, "Hey, well, if they want to download one of these notes, we're going to do a transaction fee for every one of those notes." Suddenly, there's another cost component. I think that's something else just to consider the pricing element of it as well.

## Client
Thanks. Maybe just final thing. I know you guys are still in the trial phase, but what does your gut tell you in terms of where you think Mayo Clinic's going to settle?

## Expert
I honestly couldn't answer that. It's tough to say. There's really no dialogue about like, "It's really seeming like we're going this way." It's still so new to us, I think. Again, we haven't fully deployed or scaled this across the org with any vendor. I don't think I've heard anyone say anything like that yet.

## Client
Do you guys have a timeline, roughly? If we want to make up our mind by end of 2025, it's just rolling trial?

## Expert
No, we don't. Honestly, I'm not surprised. Our organization doesn't really look at things that way. We've got lots of other vendors in our space. Again, if it works for subspecialty sub department area, it's just not something that we worry about. I know that's probably unique to our organization to some degree, but it is the way it is.

## Client
Got it. Thanks for this. Have a good one. Bye.
