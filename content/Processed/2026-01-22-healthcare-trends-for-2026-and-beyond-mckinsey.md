**The US healthcare system** continues to face considerable financial strain, although there are pockets of opportunity. Industry EBITDA as a percentage of national health expenditures (NHE) fell from 11.2 percent in 2019 to 8.9 percent in 2024. In 2027, the picture is expected to worsen slightly, with industry EBITDA as a percentage of NHE expected to drop to 8.7 percent.

Payers and providers have borne the brunt of the decline to date and will continue to feel financial pressure in the immediate future. For example, payers are facing enrollment declines in Medicaid and Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans because of regulatory changes. Meanwhile, providers could experience an increase in uncompensated care and loss of reimbursement.

Looking ahead to 2028 and 2029, we anticipate stronger results underpinned by healthcare players’ actions to buttress their financial position. They will likely move tactically to address pricing and costs and strategically to reallocate resources to growing market segments and pursue business portfolio and scale shifts through M&A and divestitures.

While the overall near-term outlook is somber, opportunities exist in several parts of the industry. Some segments of healthcare are continuing to grow rapidly, including health services and technology (HST), supported by advances in technology and AI; specialty pharmacy; and ambulatory care in the provider space.

For payers, group insurance is emerging as a bright spot as some members may be able to obtain insurance from their employers after disenrolling from ACA plans and Medicaid. In the acute care segment, attention to trends in working-age populations and demographic mix in geographies will be key to the growth of value pools.

Healthcare leaders must rethink traditional models, improve performance, and embrace technology to remain competitive. Those that do will be well positioned to lead the next chapter of US healthcare. In this year’s report, we provide a perspective on how recent challenges have affected payers, providers, HST, and pharmacy services, as well as what to expect in 2026 and beyond.

## Several healthcare segments are expected to face financial pressure

We estimate that overall healthcare EBITDA will grow annually at 5 percent in 2024–27 (Exhibit 1) and then at 10 percent annually in 2027–29 (Exhibit 2).1In this article, we use EBITDA as a measure of economic health of the industry. Only a fraction of EBITDA translates into net income for the industry, with net income margins in the low single digits after accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA returns enable organizations to generate the capital necessary for investments, including those for enhancing capacity and access, building capabilities to offer new and improved treatments and patient experience, and facilitating technology-driven transformation. Certain segments are expected to increase more slowly in 2026–27 due to ACA disenrollment given expiration of enhanced subsidies and to policy-driven changes in Medicaid business under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Other areas, such as HST and specialty pharmacy, are likely to grow steadily throughout the 2024–29 period. Below, we summarize the changes we expect to see in the payer, provider, HST, and pharmacy segments.

Manufacturers, that is, mostly pharma and biotech and medical products, are projected to have the highest EBITDA, at $328 billion, with growth rates of more than 10% from 2024 to 2027. Provider segments have the next highest EBITDA, at $297 billion. Growth rates range from 0 to under 5% among segments such as hospital, preacute or nonacute, diagnostic, and office-based physicians. Next is pharmacy services, at EBITDA of $100 billion. Growth rates are 5 to 10% for pharmacy benefit managers and administrators, specialty pharmacies, and distributors. Dispensers have a growth rate of 0% or less. Services and tech could have an EBITDA of $94 billion, with a range of growth rates among segments like payment and clinical services, data analytics, and software. Finally, payers are projected to have the lowest EBITDA, at $37 billion, with a range of growth rates among segments like group, individual, fixed-benefit and supplemental, and Medicaid (which has a negative value).

> After 2027, payer recovery will depend on adoption of new care models, optimized pricing models, industry partnerships, and AI-enabled back end transformations to enhance efficiency and cost management.

### Payers

EBITDA levels in 2024 hit historic lows across payer markets, driven by factors such as increased utilization in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising GLP-1 adoption, and membership losses following the expiration of the pandemic-era public health emergency. But we expect performance to diverge across payer markets in the coming years.

Payers have experienced higher growth in claims costs for several reasons, including the aging Medicare population (Exhibit 3) and surging pharmacy costs. The proportion of the population aged 80 and above increased from 3.8 percent in 2017 to 4.2 percent in 2024 and is estimated to reach 5.2 percent by 2029, according to US Census Bureau data. This demographic shift is expected to contribute an additional 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent annual increase in claims costs.

![Image description: Bar charts depict the spending per member per month (PMPM) and annual change in population for different age groups. The age groups with the highest spending PMPM also tend to be the oldest, that is, 70 years or older, and have the highest projected annual change in population from 2024 to 2029. The PMPM for the 70–74 age group is $972, and the projected growth in population is 2.4%. For 75–79, the PMPM is 1,251, and population growth is 3.1%. For 80 and older, the PMPM is 1,673, and the population growth in 4.8%.

Group commercial insurance is likely to emerge as the primary growth driver for payers, rebounding from historically low EBITDA margins in 2024. Meanwhile, Medicare Advantage margins are expected to stabilize at about 2 percent, remaining below historical levels.

Medicaid margins will continue to erode due to adverse selection, delays in pricing revalidation, and member disenrollment following the expiration of the public health emergency, with additional disruption expected from member disenrollment from government policy changes in 2027–28. Similarly, the ACA segment will face margin pressures from member disenrollment when enhanced subsidies expire in 2026.

After 2027, payer recovery will depend on adoption of new care models, optimized pricing models, industry partnerships, and AI-enabled back end transformations to enhance efficiency and cost management.

### Providers

Healthcare providers are navigating a complex and uneven recovery. Following years of inflationary cost shocks and labor shortages, utilization has rebounded—but financial risks have also increased. Rising levels of uncompensated care, particularly from those who are uninsured, are expected to pressure EBITDA margins in 2027, with annual EBITDA growth from 2024 to 2027 estimated at just 1 percent.

Hospitals, in particular, may face further margin erosion from policy changes such as site neutrality, which is not yet reflected in current estimates. Beyond 2027, the shift of uninsured individuals into employer-sponsored coverage as they gain eligibility in their current roles or seek new employment with health coverage will support provider margin recovery. Providers are expected to adopt further cost-management measures to support margins.

Amid these challenges, overall non-acute care remains a strong growth area. Post-acute and outpatient care continue as bright spots supported by segments such as home health, hospice, and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), with an aging population and continued site-of-care shifts fueling growth. In contrast, other outpatient areas such as diagnostic imaging centers and dialysis clinics are expected to experience relatively low growth.

> Federal policy changes, such as the Rural Health Transformation Program, are creating funding opportunities for technology use cases.

### Health services and technology

HST is expected to continue as the fastest growing segment in healthcare. Software platforms have a growing role within the healthcare ecosystem, enabling providers and payers to become more efficient in an increasingly complex environment. Technological innovation (for example, gen AI and machine learning) is creating opportunities for stakeholders across segments by automating workflows, promoting data connectivity and interoperability, and generating actionable insights.2Nikhil Sahni et al., *The potential impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare spending*, National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, number 30857, January 2023.

As these innovations mature, providers and payers are likely to continue seeking outsourced services and technology platforms to capture efficiencies and cost savings. This could create large value pools for software and tech-enabled-services platforms and advanced data and analytics businesses that can offer healthcare-tailored services.

Federal policy changes, such as the Rural Health Transformation Program, are creating funding opportunities for technology use cases (for example, telehealth services and AI tools). HST players are well positioned to help states and rural health providers implement these innovative technologies, which may contribute to increased outsourcing. These policy changes, coupled with the pace of technological innovation with AI, may also accelerate a shift in value pools within HST segment toward software platforms and tech-enabled-services companies.

### Pharmacy services

Pharmacy services are undergoing sweeping change. Specialty drugs, GLP-1 therapies, and new pricing models are reshaping the cost structure of pharmaceutical care. Cost-plus models and direct-to-consumer distribution are gaining traction as stakeholders seek greater transparency and affordability. Drug net spending rose by 11 percent from 2023 to 2024, largely due to innovative therapies such as GLP-1 agonists. US gross drug expenditure is anticipated to grow by about 8 percent annually from 2024 to 2029, potentially reaching $990 billion by 2029. Ambulatory infusion and hospital specialty pharmacy are expected to see the most rapid growth, exceeding 10 percent annually.

Regulatory and policy changes at both the federal and state levels are reshaping the pharmacy landscape. These changes may affect existing EBITDA margin drivers and could increase import costs amid global supply chain pressures. Furthermore, value chain pressure is heightening competition for prescriptions. Key competitive areas include the 340B discount value between providers and payers or pharmacy benefit managers, the rivalry between vertically integrated and independent pharmacies, the preference for ambulatory and home settings over hospital outpatient departments for complex infusions, and the expanding role of pharma-owned and -supported direct-to-consumer models.

Let’s look more closely at subsector performance.

## Payers: Group insurance is expected to become the largest payer segment

In 2024, overall payer EBITDA was about $29 billion, down from about $61 billion in 2023. Payers’ results were affected by higher utilization, regulatory actions, and coverage shifts as people enrolled in Medicaid became uninsured. Because of these factors, EBITDA margins for commercial business fell from 3.4 percent to 1.8 percent; for government business, they fell from 2.9 percent to 0.5 percent.

Medical costs rose an average of 7 percent annually between 2021 and 2024. Pharmacy costs grew even faster at 9 percent annually.3National Association of Insurance Commissioners data on payer financial filings. This rise in pharmacy spending is largely the result of increased use of GLP-1 drugs and high-cost specialty injectables. We estimate that pharmacy spending will increase about 8 percent annually, driven by growth in infusion and hospital specialty pharmacy use. Besides pharmacy, utilization of categories such as behavioral health services and emergency departments has also increased, further contributing to rising claims costs.

Near-term payer EBITDA faces headwinds. While group commercial and Medicare businesses are expected to stabilize and recover between 2024 and 2027, the ACA and Medicaid segments face a 25 to 30 percent decline in EBITDA due to disenrollment, prompted by enhanced subsidy expiration and the impact of the OBBBA. These factors will slow revenue growth and compress margins through adverse selection. Recovery for the ACA and Medicaid segments is anticipated in 2028 and 2029, driven by pricing adjustments and enrollment shifts. Overall, we estimate payer EBITDA will see
