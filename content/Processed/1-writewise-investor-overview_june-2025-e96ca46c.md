## Slide 2: The $518 billion PBM industry¹ is at a crossroads

Intense public focus on the cost of drugs and the role of PBM's has forced opaque pricing and rebate constructs into the light of day

**Employer Consideration to Switch PBM's**
93%
2023 Survey of more than 600 Key Decision Makers in employee Benefits – PER BENEFITS PRO

**Employers Concerned over Lack of transparency in contracting and rebates**
72%
2022 Survey of 152 Large Employers – PER CFO.COM

8.6%
– PER HEALTH SYSTEM TRACKER

1) GRAND VIEW RESEARCH ESTIMATED THE MARKET AT $518.6 BILLION REVENUE IN 2023, PROJECTING IT TO REACH $934 BILLION BY 2030

## Slide 3: The Chaos of PBM RFPs and Historical Claims Repricing

**Traditional Repricing Challenges**
8-10 Weeks
Reprice is historical, not next year's risk
No certainty or ability to budget Rx
Zero PBM accountability for total Rx Cost

**Workflow Steps:**
*   Data Collection
    *   9/15
*   Data Validation
    *   10/1
*   Cost Analysis
    *   10/15
*   Repricing
    *   10/22
*   Comparison Analysis
    *   10/10
*   Reporting Results
    *   12/1
*   Effective Date
    *   1/1

**Who's Validating?**
1.  Time Sensitive Process
2.  Delays Mission Critical Operations
3.  Almost Always Human Error

**Outdated & Inaccurate Process**
1.  Long & Tedious Process
2.  Channel Discounts are Arbitrary & Speculative
3.  Only Historical Repricings

**Is The Proposal**
1.  Transparent?
2.  Validated?
3.  Accurate?
4.  Competitive Enough to Close?

**Start Searching For Data**
1.  Delays Providing & Receiving Data
2.  Incomplete Datasets
3.  Endless Follow Ups & chasing Partners down

**An Impossible Task**
1.  Large Datasets
2.  Limited Information
3.  No Pharmacy Manual
4.  Lack of Transparency

**Stakeholder Increase Expectations Near The Effective Date**
1.  Ask for Additional Scenarios
2.  Adjustments to Groups
3.  Big 3 PBM's Comes back with a lower number you need to beat

## Slide 9: Fixed Cost Product 1: PMPM Guarantee

Why do plan sponsors want a PMPM Guarantee?

*   **Alignment**
    *   A PMPM Guarantee aligns the interests of the PBM and Plan Sponsor by incentivizing the PBM to effectively manage the program and penalizing them if they don't

*   **Accountability**
    *   A PMPM Guarantee is the simplest and most effective way to hold a PBM accountable for their management of the plan

*   **Certainty**
    *   Budgetary certainty is provided to the Plan Sponsor by capping the plan's financial exposure

*   **Comparability**
    *   A PMPM Guarantee is the simplest way to evaluate PBM's in an RFP setting by reducing the impact of all other variables

## Slide 12: MavRx Workflow

**5 Minutes, not 5 weeks**

*   **Audit the Incumbent**
    *   You upload the prospect's claims and pricing data—takes two minutes. MavRx spits out a full audit in seconds, showing where their current PBM's overcharging. Think hidden rebates or specialty drug markups.

*   **Reprice the PBM Panel**
    *   We've got your PBM panel ready to go. MavRx reprices those same claims across the entire panel, so you see who delivers the best net cost—apples-to-apples, no fluff.

*   **Obtain a PMPM Guarantee**
    *   From that reprice, we create a PMPM Guarantee for each PBM—a hard cap on pharmacy costs. Plus, our custom MedImpact contract (Optimal) doesn't even need claims history to underwrite, so you're covered for tough prospects.

*   **Package w/ Stop Loss**
    *   You bundle those guarantees with your standard stop-loss submission and send them to our MGU panel. They see predictable Rx costs and can shave 15% or more off premiums or aggregate factors—cash back for your client.
