## Slide 5: My Story
My Story

**Family History**
I grew up around healthcare. My parents were both immigrants, my mom a resident who carried me around the hospital and my dad drove a taxi to pay for college. They started CenterPointe—a behavioral health hospital system they owned and operated for 25 years before selling to Acadia in 2021.

My brother started telebehavioral health company with 1DocWay before selling to Genoa, which was acquired by Advent. He served on the board through the Optum acquisition, where he ran the telebehavioral business for several years before launching his second company focused on Serious Mental Illness.

**Aimun Malik**
Co-Founder and CEO

**My Journey**
After starting my career in M&A, private equity, and venture capital, I joined Triple Aim Partners - a company creation platform.

As a GM of NewCo creation, I worked on four companies collectively worth $1.5 billion: two capitated primary care MSOs (Oasis in the Medicare Advantage space and Diverge in the Managed Medicaid space) and two multi-site behavioral companies (Guidelight in the IOP space and Steadfast in the MAT space)

## Slide 6: The Triple Aim Lessons
The Triple Aim Lessons

**Remarkable De Novo Economics**
Companies built with an average investment of $5 million transacted for over $1 billion each. This was exemplified by the successful exits of Prospero and ArchWell, both sold for over $1 billion.

**Compounding Value via Playbooks**
Institutionalized playbooks across portfolio companies for key functions like market selection, payor development, and recruiting ensured each successive company became more valuable than the last.

## Slide 7: ANNA—NDBI Centers of Excellence
ANNA—NDBI Centers of Excellence

ANNA was founded on the insight that traditional Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) was ineffective and even harmful to young children, and a novel model of clinical interventions, Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI), was the most evidence-based model of care. NDBI was a wedge by which we could create tech-enabled centers of excellence.

**Challenges in Traditional ABA : Discrete Trial Training**
*   **Rote Learning Focus**
    Limits generalization of skills, making them hard to apply in real life.
*   **External Reinforcement**
    Can lead to over-reliance on rewards and diminish intrinsic motivation.
*   **Discrete, Adult-Led Instruction**
    Less natural and can hinder spontaneous social engagement and interaction.
*   **Rigid Structure**
    Increases anxiety or resistance, especially for young children with autism.
*   **Limited Family Involvement**
    Parents are less empowered and involved in their child's therapeutic progress.
*   **Fragmented Care**
    Difficulty in coordinating multiple therapies, leading to disjointed treatment.

**ANNA Care Model: Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions**
*   **Natural Context Learning**
    Emphasizes learning in natural contexts, ensuring skills transfer to real-life situations.
*   **Intrinsic Motivation**
    Emphasizes child-initiated activities, fostering deeper learning and self-drive.
*   **Play-Based & Social Interaction**
    Incorporates natural contingencies and developmental principles for better social engagement.
*   **Flexible, Play-Based Routines**
    Reduces stress and is more suitable for young children, encouraging participation.
*   **Active Parent Partnership**
    Involves parents as active partners, enhancing consistency and improving outcomes.
*   **Integrated Care**
    Fosters collaboration between behavioral, speech, and occupational therapies for holistic support.

## Slide 8: ANNA's Launch
ANNA's Launch

ANNA opened our first location in Sudbury, Massachusetts in February 2024 with a novel hypothesis: Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI) represented both superior clinical care for autistic children and a model actively sought by referral sources and families.

## Slide 9: Proving the Multi-Site Playbook
Proving the Multi-Site Playbook

**Wayland Success**
We opened our second center in Wayland, Massachusetts and grew from 0 to $1.6 million in ARR within just 6 months—growing at a faster rate than our Sudbury center and definitively proving out the multi-site playbook.

Each new center unlocks entirely new sub-markets with their own referral networks, talent pools, and family populations - enabling parallelized growth.

**ANNA Wayland Annual Recurring Revenue, March 2025 - August 2025**

| Date      | Annual Recurring Revenue |
| :-------- | :----------------------- |
| 3/1/2025  | $80,000                  |

| 8/1/2025  | $1,600,000               |

**Weston Launch**
Building on this proven model, our newest location in Weston, Massachusetts, became active this month. We've already secured 5 full-day-equivalent (FDE) clients waiting to start services, creating an opportunity for Weston to achieve profitability within its very first month. This rapid success highlights the increasing efficiency and predictability of our multi-site expansion strategy, with each successive launch demonstrating even faster ramp-up times and stronger financial performance.

**Months to $1mm of ARR**

| Location | Months from Opening |
| :------- | :------------------ |
| Sudbury  | 6                   |
| Wayland  | 4                   |

## Slide 10: ANNA's Four Core Advantages
ANNA's Four Core Advantages

**Clinical Excellence**
Repeatable, scalable approach to delivering high-quality NDBI services that outperform traditional ABA across all major developmental domains in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Score.

**Talent Recruitment**
Repeatable, scalable methodologies to recruit and develop clinical talent with 2.7% BT acceptance rate and 10.5% BCBA acceptance rate

**Family Attraction**
Repeatable, scalable, and profitable channels of attracting families through superior outcomes and brand-led flywheel

**Economic Efficiency**
Consistently strong and improving unit economics with 10x cash flow / investment economics for exponential organic growth.

The core advantage arises from the compounding benefit of layering each function upon the other. Superior clinical outcomes attract both the best talent and families, which drives word-of-mouth growth, which enables favorable payor contracting at 20-40% above rack rates.

## Slide 11: Massachusetts Market Strategy
Massachusetts Market Strategy

Our real estate approach in Greater Boston consists of identifying 7 core markets that make up the region: Middlesex, Central, North Shore Inside 95, South Shore Inside 95, North Shore, South Shore, and Worcester County—opening locations in each.

*   **8**
    Locations Secured
    4 open locations, 1 in construction, and 3 LOIs signed
*   **$40mm**
    PF ARR
    Across just these 8 locations
*   **$16mm**
    PF Contribution Profit
    Making Massachusetts highly profitable after deducting ~$4M corporate expense

**Key Insight:** Each sub-market can support more than 1 fully-ramped center. At 3 centers per sub-market, this represents a $105 million top-line opportunity in Greater Boston alone—before considering Springfield and other large metros in Massachusetts.

*(Image: Map of Massachusetts with highlighted regions and location markers)*

## Slide 12: Market Entry Framework
Market Entry Framework

*(Diagram showing "Acquisition" at the center, accelerating all workstreams, surrounded by four main workstreams)*

*   **Licensing**
    Licensing with the state
*   **Payor Contracting**
    Contracting with commercial and government payors.
*   **Real Estate**
    Site selection and leasing
*   **General Manager Recruitment**
    Recruiting a market-level GM

The market entry process involves four main workstreams that are often pursued in parallel:
*   **Licensing with the state:** Securing necessary regulatory approvals
*   **Contracting with Payors:** Establishing agreements with insurance providers.
*   **Recruiting a GM:** Identifying and hiring local leadership.
*   **Real Estate:** Locating and securing physical premises.

An alternative, fifth workstream, Acquisition, can significantly accelerate market entry by automatically unlocking or expediting the licensing, contracting, and real estate processes, allowing for a faster and more integrated market penetration.

## Slide 30: Pediatric Mental Health: Deep Dive
Pediatric Mental Health: Deep Dive

Individuals with autism are 25x more likely to make a suicide attempt than non-autistic adults. This critical adjacency to autism care is important not only for more effective autism services but also for more effective delivery of pediatric behavioral health overall for the 1 in 5 children with mental health conditions.

The superior clinical model combines Parent-Management Training (PMT), actively engaging parents in clinical service delivery, with Modular Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MCBT), a more flexible application of CBT to better fit individual needs of children and adolescents.

## Slide 31: The Blueprint Opportunity
The Blueprint Opportunity

**$2.5 Trillion Healthcare Services Market**

AI has unlocked an entirely new frontier within healthcare services, creating an opportunity to transform care delivery via the repeatable creation of category-defining healthcare businesses. The opportunity for Blueprint Health compounds the remarkable de novo economics we've already proven at ANNA and sets a foundational opportunity to leverage core infrastructure to build a generational company creation engine.

This transformation begins with the clinical model itself. AI has enabled the transformation of clinical care delivery to be aligned with the highest quality, evidence-based practice at scale via tools like AI LMS, AI clinical fidelity, and AI wraparound clinical care delivery plugging the gaps between care.

The opportunity is not just to build a category-defining business, but to build a business that redefines the category of healthcare services.

## Slide 33: Why Vertical Integration Wins
Why Vertical Integration Wins

The far and away most common path for companies embracing AI today is to build the application layer on top of foundational models rather than vertically integrate into owning the economics of the end customer. While this will create valuable businesses, three key insights make vertical integration more compelling:

**Last-Mile Problem**
Within healthcare, AI at the application layer struggles from a last-mile problem. Healthcare companies are too idiosyncratic in their workflows and technology stacks for pure horizontal applications. We couldn't purchase an AI treatment plan automation tool off-the-shelf because our clinical model is unique and our EMR is customized.

**Limited Pricing Power**
Pricing power for AI applications is generally limited. With the cost of development collapsing due to increasingly effective AI tooling, the replacement cost of insourcing a previously outsourced AI application is substantially lower. Traditional software relied on economies of scale and high replacement costs to justify pricing.

**Value Capture**
The profit pools have expanded so drastically that the point of leverage is in the residual owner of that profit pool rather than the tooling that enables its creation. AI applications create exceptional value, but the dollar amount largely accrues to the customer.

## Slide 34: De Novo vs. Acquisition Economics
De Novo vs. Acquisition Economics

An M&A playbook leveraging AI can acquire a 20% margin asset at 7.5x, double top-line and double margin to 40% to flip for a 4x return. But the real value creation occurs when rather than buy at 7.5x, you can build at 0.1x for a 300x return.

**Acquisition Economics**

| Metric                              | Pre-AI        | Post-AI       |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------ |
| Single-Unit Revenue                 | $5,000,000    | $10,000,000   |
| Single-Unit EBITDA Margin           | 20.0%         | 40.0%         |
| Single-Unit EBITDA                  | $1,000,000    | $4,000,000    |
| (x) Enterprise Value / EBITDA Multiple | 7.5x          | 7.5x          |
| **Purchase / Sale Price**           | **$7,500,000**| **$30,000,000** |
| (/) Purchase Price                  | $7,500,000    | $7,500,000    |
| **Return on Invested Capital**      | **1.0x**      | **4.0x**      |

**De Novo Economics**

| Metric                              | Pre-AI        | Post-AI       |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------ |
| Single Unit Investment to Breakeven | $100,000      | $100,000      |
| Single-Unit Revenue                 | 5,000,000     | 10,000,000    |
| Single-Unit EBITDA Margin           | 20.0%         | 40.0%         |
| Single-Unit EBITDA                  | $1,000,000    | $4,000,000    |
| (x) Enterprise Value / EBITDA Multiple | 7.5x          | 7.5x          |
| **Enterprise Value**                | **$7,500,000**| **$30,000,000** |
| (/) Single Unit Investment to Breakeven | $100,000      | $100,000      |
| **Return on Invested Capital**      | **75.0x**     | **300.0x**    |

The acquisition multiples are expanding to fair market value as the market recognizes AI transformation potential. The arbitrage window is closing for M&A, but wide open for de novo creation.

## Slide 35: Blueprint Corporate Structure
Blueprint Corporate Structure

The Blueprint structure involves converting ANNA into a wholly-owned subsidiary of a HoldCo, Blueprint, and centralizing corporate staffing and infrastructure to build new category defining companies as subsidiaries of the HoldCo initially financed off balance sheet capital and HoldCo capital structure and then financing externally as required. This process begins with nearest adjacency of pediatric behavioral health and expands beyond specialties as competency surface area expands.

**Steps in Corporate Structure Development:**

1.  **Step 1:** New Delaware C-Corporation is filed—Blueprint Health
2.  **Step 2:** Restructure ANNA into a subsidiary owned by HoldCo & transition equity (as proportioned) into HoldCo, net of ESOP
3.  **Step 3:** Hire centralized staff at HoldCo level (IIRs, CIRs, FDEs, and shared services team)
4.  **Step 4:** Identify, diligence, and get to a go on new OpCo businesses
5.  **Step 5:** Create Delaware C-Corporations as wholly-owned subsidiaries of HoldCo for each new OpCo, with dedicated ESOP by company
6.  **Step 6:** Capitalize OpCo's from HoldCo balance sheet with $5 million in initial equity and transition relevant HoldCo staff into operating companies to run the business
7.  **Step 7:** As company matures, raise external financing (equity and / or debt) to finance continued growth at the OpCo level
8.  **Step 8:** Leverage competencies from ANNA adjacencies in pediatric behavioral health to launch other behavioral health businesses (repeat steps 6-7)
9.  **Step 9:** Leverage comprehensive company creation traction to launch non-behavioral health specialties (repeat steps 6 – 7)

**Entities:**
*   Blueprint Health (HoldCo)
*   ANNA (OpCo)
*   Pediatric Mental Health OpCo
*   Adolescent Behavioral Addiction OpCo
*   Adolescent Eating Disorder OpCo
*   Other BH Specialties (future OpCos)
*   Non-BH Specialties (future OpCos)
