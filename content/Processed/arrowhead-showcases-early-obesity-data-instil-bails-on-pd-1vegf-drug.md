Arrowhead’s RNA drugs could aid with “high-quality” weight loss, according to one analyst. Elsewhere, the PD-1/VEGF field got less crowded and Amgen and Lilly struck startup deals.

Today, a brief rundown of news from Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals and Instil Bio, as well as updates from Agmen, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson that you may have missed.

Amgen will work with Disco Pharmaceuticals to unearth cancer drugs that address an unspecified target Disco mapped on the surface of tumor cells, the companies said Wednesday. Per deal terms, Amgen will get rights to develop and commercialize programs that emerge from the collaboration, while Disco could receive up to $618 million plus sales royalties. The deal is the second startup-focused investment Amgen made this week, following a buyout of another oncology biotech, Dark Blue Therapeutics. — Ben Fidler

Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday it plans to start a Phase 3 trial of its experimental drug nipocalimab in the most common form of lupus following positive mid-stage study results. According to J&J, nipocalimab met the study’s main objective by helping improve measures of disease control compared to a placebo after 24 weeks. J&J didn’t provide specifics, but noted that the findings mark the first successful study results for an “FcRn” blocker in lupus. Nipocalimab, which the pharma giant sells as Imaavy, was approved in April to treat generalized myasthenia gravis. The company paid $6.5 billion to acquire its original developer, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, and has said projected sales could eclipse $5 billion annually at their peak. — Delilah Alvarado
