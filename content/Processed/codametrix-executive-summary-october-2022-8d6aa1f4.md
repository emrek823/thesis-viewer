## Executive Summary                             October 2022

### The Problem
Today 20-25% of US healthcare spending is wasted on administrative and revenue cycle tasks. Coding is the costliest and most highly manual component of healthcare revenue cycle functions. Coding for Professional Billing (PB) alone is estimated to be a $9.5B addressable market. Autonomous coding is a critical step in reducing administrative costs and reimagining healthcare reimbursement models.

### The Solution
The CodaMetrix (CMX) technology platform combines Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to autonomously code PB cases, extracting information from the electronic health record to significantly improve the quality, efficiency, and cost of medical coding. Working with AI researchers and developers at MIT, Harvard, and Northeastern Universities, CMX initially developed its technology platform to automate coding and charge capture functions for Mass General Brigham (MGB), a leading academic health system with 14 hospitals and more than $14 billion in annual revenue. CMX currently processes radiology and pathology encounters and is on schedule to release modules for surgery, gastroenterology, inpatient bedside visits, and emergency department services during 2023.

### Progress-To-Date
By the end of 2022, the CMX platform will be in use at more than a dozen large health systems (over 60 hospitals) including CU Medicine (Colorado), Mass General Brigham, Mount Sinai Health System (New York), Oregon Health &#x26; Science University, Yale New Haven Medicine, and the University of Miami Health System. The company has implemented its solution in multiple specialty areas with significant improvements in billing performance, coding quality, cost reduction as well as reducing administrative burden for physicians and other providers. CMX expects to end 2022 with contracted revenue of more than $13 million.

### A SaaS Technology Platform
CMX-AutomateÔ autonomously codes more than 70% of coding volume without requiring changes in documentation or workflow. With ongoing utilization, CMX-Automate’s performance continuously improves. CMX customers currently experience 60% fewer denials compared to manual coding. Rapidly integrating into existing workflows, the CMX platform provides an immediate and significant ROI. Other commercially available solutions automate a small portion of overall volume, usually 20%-40%, while requiring adherence to predictable documentation formats. CMX-AmplifyÔ, an EHR-embedded coding decision support tool, enables coders to efficiently process the minority of cases requiring manual coding, while the system learns coding best practices. CMX clients can participate in the CMX-ConsortiumÔ Program with incentives for providers that contribute data and expertise to the platform. CMX expects the per customer ARR potential for use of the platform to exceed $1.7 million as customers adopt new and additional autonomous coding modules for multiple and various specialty areas.

CodaMetrix is raising a $25 – $30 million Series A. The financing will enable CMX to scale sales and operations, significantly increase revenue, speed platform development, and achieve profitability.
