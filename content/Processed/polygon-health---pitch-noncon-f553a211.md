## Slide 6: Problem Statement

**Problem Statement**

## Slide 7: Problem Statement

**Problem Statement**
One solution solving two problems via marketplace

**Patient pain point**
Patients cannot capture the full value of their own data informationally or economically

**According to National Academies of Sci, Eng, and Med**
As owners of their own data, patients become greater stakeholders in their own health. Instead of being the target of interventions aimed at them, patients who own their data become self-advocates, better able to articulate their personal preferences and achieve self-determined health goals.
https://issues.org/patient-innovation-electronic-medical-records-ai/#:~:text=As%20owners%20of%20their%20own,achieve%20self%2Ddetermined%20health%20goals.

**Health researchers pain point**
Real world data sets do not capture the full-story of the patient, leaving most research studies infeasible.

**According to McKinsey**
Unfortunately, most healthcare data sets are more suited to administrative and billing purposes than research and RWE. As such, they are often incomplete and may include built-in biases. Indeed, there are numerous additional data-quality issues that lie beyond the scope of this article. Additionally, visibility into RWD is often limited until after the data set is purchased, which makes a comprehensive appraisal of the data challenging, time-consuming, and potentially expensive.

## Slide 13: Why Now?

**Why now?**

**Legislation**
By Dec 31, 2022 – patients must be given electronic access, free of charge, to their protected health information.
- 21st Century Cures Act

As 2022 draws to a close, it also marks the conclusion of several information-blocking deadlines. Physicians, hospitals and healthcare facilities should ensure they are in compliance with 21st Century Cures Act requirements.

Looking ahead, note that December 31, 2022, is important for the Cures Act. It is technology-related and applies to access for patients and how the information is shared nationally and internationally. By December 31, patients must be given electronic access, free of charge, to their protected health information through an online patient portal or app. Patients will have the ability to review their visit in real time and request changes. Physicians should consider and plan for potential issues that may arise from open records.

As a reminder, this act has major implications for both patients and providers. For patients, it is intended to expand access to their own medical records, which is shown to strengthen patient engagement and improve health outcomes. For healthcare providers, it aims to improve interoperability between health information systems.

**Investment**
One of the greatest missed opportunities in health care is all of the "dark data" out there - a16z
$1.8B VC invested in RWE startups since 2019

One of the greatest missed opportunities in health care is all of the "dark data" out there - this includes all the critically useful data sets detailing specific patient treatments and health outcomes that are hidden to doctors and researchers let alone to the entire medical field. In an age of data and modern machine learning, it shouldn't be so hard for this data to see the light of day.

In a market full of bears, we are bulls when it comes to consumer health companies. In our last piece, we made the bold claim that a consumer health tech company will become the biggest company in the world. In this piece, we will dive more specifically into areas of consumer health where we see opportunity.

92% of consumers would use a service that makes it easier to control their personal information
- Venture Beat

*(Image: Mobile app screenshot titled "sheqo" with text "92% Of consumers would use a service that makes it easier to control their personal information". Displays various screens, one showing "Give us your info. Get a free bottle", another "PERSONAL DATA" with a date range, and a "REVOKE CONSENT" button.)*

However, marketers will be surprised to learn that 84% of consumers are more likely to share information with brands that have transparent data practices and policies. Not only that, but 77% of consumers said that transparent data practices actually impact their purchasing decisions – with half saying they try to purchase more from transparent brands, and 30% only purchasing from products that demonstrate transparency.

## Slide 17: Marketplace connects a patient's health data with opportunities

**Marketplace connects a patient's health data with opportunities**

We will open a marketplace where researchers can post research studies and patients will be matched to them.

Patients can choose to participate in the research study, view the study details, and get paid for the temporary and secure license of their data.

Patients can also form communities around the research study and communicate to other participants and to researchers directly.

In the future, the marketplace can open up to more opportunities other than for research. This is also related to clinical trial recruitment, market research, 3rd party software developers, etc.

NOTE: These are examples

*(Image 1: Mobile app screenshot of a marketplace feed. Tab selected "Recruiting". Shows a study: "Clinical blood test: general analysis, leukoformula, ..." with "346/500 involved" and "$100". Dates: "2021-12-25 16:00" and "Deadline 2021-12-26 16:00". A "Leave" button is visible.)*

*(Image 2: Mobile app screenshot of a study detail page for "Diabetes Research Institute". Tabs "Message", "Forum". Study details: "Clinical blood test: general analysis, leukoformula, ESR" with "346/500 involved" and "$100". Dates: "2022-12-02 16:00" and "Deadline2022-12-06 24:00". A "Schedule" button is visible. Below, a description of the study: "On the contrary, increased osmotic resistance of erythrocytes indicates the presence of flattened erythrocytes (leptocytes), in such cells the ratio of surface area to volume is reduced.")*

## Slide 18: Researchers access a web portal to manage their studies

**Researchers access a web portal to manage their studies**

*(Image 1: Web portal screenshot for "Polygon". Left sidebar with navigation: "Add", "Home page", "Research Plan" (expanded to "Plan", "Group orders", "Data", "Order"), "Messages", "Permission", "Account". Main content shows a study card: "Clinical blood test: general analysis, leukoformula, ESR".

"Press release 3 hours Valid until July 21, 23:59". "Diseases #Hemophilia". A "Goal" section. Two smaller cards show "Clinical blood test: general analysis, leukoformula, ESR" with "346/500 involved", "$30", "Deadline 24:00" from "Posted 3 hours ago". A "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" profile card with "Message" and "Forum" buttons is also visible.)*

*(Image 2: Web portal screenshot for "Polygon". Left sidebar same as Image 1. Main content shows data related to a study. A table with headers "Data name", "Manufacturer", "Time", "Document". Data rows show: "Clinical blood test", "Manufacturer name", "2021-12-29", and a document icon for "Document". A profile image of "Mason Mount" is in the bottom left corner.)*

## Slide 19: Community

**Community**

We have a community page where users can post questions and have health-related discussions. This is to promote engagement with users and to exchange important information.

We will monitor how people use this in order to develop more features to help people connect to each other (based on their data) and build communities

*(Image 1: Mobile app screenshot of a "Home" feed in the community section. "Feed Following" selected. Posts include: "Any suggestions? Weilin37 12-11-2022 12:04 My levels were 0.80 ng/dl (ref 0.74 - 1.42), we are testing again in a month. I am on medication and it's worked great for several years. Now I am asking for an increase in dose. Any suggestions? ... read all". Another post: "Should I reduce m... Weilin37 12-11-2022 12:03 I heard people experiencing flares have improved symptoms after reducing meat Should I reduce meat? Yes No ... read all Anonymous Vote: True")*

*(Image 2: Mobile app screenshot of a "Messages" page. Shows various chat conversations: "System information no messages", "Weilin37、cky... 12-11-2022 12:06:29 I created a group chat", "Hurl 12-11-2022 12:06:15 Let me know what you find out", "Holaamigo 12-11-2022 12:05:58 Do you see the link?", "connor 12-11-2022 10:27:02 howdy", "zssa 12-03-2022 14:13:39 Hello")*

## Slide 20: Competitor Background

**Competitor Background**

*(Image: Polygon Health logo)*

## Slide 21: 3rd Party Aggregation vs. Direct-to-patient

**3rd Party Aggregation vs. Direct-to-patient**

*(Column 1: 3rd Party Aggregation)*
*(Logos: TriNetX, IQVIA, flatiron, TRUVEN HEALTH ANALYTICS™, healthverity, OPTUM®)*
Third party aggregators are the current industry incumbents and have a dominant presence among researchers
*   Aggregate large datasets direct from EMRs without patient involvement

**Advantages**
*   High volume of data
*   Immediate access and availability

**Disadvantages**
*   Expensive annual licenses
*   Wasteful – most data not useful
*   Valuable data locked behind censorship
*   Manual curation of notes cost prohibitive
*   Retrospective-only
*   3 to 6-month data lag

*(Column 2: Direct-to-patient)*
*(Logo: Polygon Health logo, PicnicHealth, ciitizen, SEQSTER™, AllStripes, evidation)*
Direct-to-patient newcomers change the model by asking data directly from patients, thus fulfilling data-gaps

**Advantages**
*   Pay only for what you need
*   Link traditional + non-traditional data
*   Censorship can be bypassed
*   Can be prospective and retrospective
*   Real-time data

**Disadvantages**
*   Newcomers - patient recruitment efforts
*   Only in the beginning stages of researcher-awareness

## Slide 23: Polygon is setup for scalable distribution

**Polygon is setup for scalable distribution**

**Polygon Health**
Polygon Health prioritizes decentralized network building and incentivizing networks to grow organically via platform features that promote sharing and referrals

1.  Incentives for both patients and doctors to spread word-of-mouth
2.  Public-facing social media site optimizes for SEO
3.  Full value of data goes to the patient, which is a major incentive.
4.  A marketplace design can evolve into providing an open SDK to link with other health wallet solutions
5.  A marketplace design opens to use cases beyond RWD such as 3rd party developers, clinical trial recruitment, etc

**Direct Competitors**
Competitors prioritizes patient-facing product features and research-driven use-cases to provide a centralized service

1.  Competitors only provide a patient-facing health data app. Patients have no incentive to tell others
2.  There is often no social or community feature for users to connect or form networks. If they do it is locked behind a registration wall
3.  Competitors keep most of the data revenue to themselves
4.  Competitors depend on their proprietary health wallet solution
5.  Competitor products are not designed to evolve beyond RWD research space
