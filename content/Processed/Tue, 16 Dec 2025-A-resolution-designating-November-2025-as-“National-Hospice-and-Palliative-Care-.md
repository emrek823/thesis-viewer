## Summary
This is a resolution to designate November 2025 as 'National Hospice and Palliative Care Month', which is primarily a symbolic recognition of hospice and palliative care services. The resolution aims to raise awareness about end-of-life care and support for patients and families dealing with serious illness.

## Startup Angle
While this specific resolution doesn't directly create a market opportunity, it could indirectly benefit digital health startups focusing on end-of-life care technology, such as remote patient monitoring for hospice, care coordination platforms for palliative care teams, or telehealth solutions that improve patient comfort and family communication during critical care stages.
