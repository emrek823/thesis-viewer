### Client
I really appreciate you taking the time today. We're currently doing some research on AI voice solutions in the context of medical practices with a particular emphasis on Assort Health. I noticed that you are a customer of theirs through TrustCare. Maybe just to get started, we'd love to learn a bit about your background as well as some context on TrustCare. Your specialties, number of locations, geographic footprint, etc.

### Expert
Okay. The quick and boring version of my background is I spent my career in healthcare in orthopedics and specifically orthopedic trauma. My company was acquired after 21 years, was acquired by J&J, and I lasted about two years with that and then ran for the hills. I then opened a laboratory with some friends, and we were actually a reference lab for TrustCare.

When our lab didn't succeed, TrustCare asked me to come and run it and grow it, from that point, three clinics to the 13 we have today. Our footprint is primarily Mississippi. We've got 12 clinics that are all within no more than 40 minutes of each other. We have one clinic that is in Hattiesburg, Mississippi that's about two hours south and soon to have a second one there.

We have three clinics dedicated to pediatrics, both primary and urgent care, staffed by pediatricians and nurse practitioners. We have one stand-alone primary care clinic that's staffed with a physician and a nurse practitioner. We have nine urgent care clinics, some of which we do only urgent care and some of which we do urgent and primary care as well. We've got about 160 full-time employees and probably another 60-65 part time staff depending upon the time of year and day of the week. I'll take a breath there and see if that gives you some perspective as to who we are and what we do.

### Client
Yeah, incredibly helpful. Huge congrats on starting a company that got acquired by the blue chip name in healthcare. Maybe switching gears a bit, at what point did you realize that you were in the market for an AI voice solution, and how did you approach that evaluation process?

### Expert
I put us in the market last year in August of 2024. Two things had occurred. Three things that are relevant. One, my background is in engineering, not in healthcare. It just so happens I turned out to be in healthcare my whole life. Two, we switched phone vendors for our VoIP phone systems.

We went from a vendor that could give us virtually no visibility into our phones to a vendor that could give us more visibility than you could ever imagine as far as number of calls, time of call, length of call, number of rings before it's answered, hold time, transfers, direct transfers, indirect transfers, and I could go on for an hour, but I'll bore you with the details. The short version is we have a matrix of information that can provide us a wealth of information on calls coming into our clinic.

They're the biggest cell phone provider in the Southeastern United States, a privately held company called C Spire. They do all of our fiber to our clinics, and they actually managed our phone too. Somewhere along the line, before I ever got here, somebody thought it'd be a good idea to roll up as much to them as we could. The trouble is they're a cell phone company trying to be a desktop phone company, and they're not for us. If you had a nine-to-five business, Monday through Friday, that never changed, they work great. When you've got clinics that are forever moving, that are open seven days a week, hours change, phone volumes change. The inability to report data was really the most painful thing, and that's why we left.

Once we did leave, the one thing that I discovered, I now worked eight months trying to figure out the rationale behind this. Our call volume mirrors within about 5-15% of each individual patient volume at a clinic. We don't have a centralized call center. We effectively have 13 call centers, which are 13 clinics that answer the phone.

I can tell you, literally, on any given day, if a clinic sees 100 people, they have between 90 and 100 phone calls. If they see 50 people, they have between 47 and 54 phone calls. It's that way almost every day. There are a few more calls per patient in pediatrics. That has a lot to do with mothers coming back with questions about medications or nursing or the baby's not sleeping or what have you, but that's pretty linear.

We have a few more calls per patient visit in primary care, and those are traditionally built around medication questions or lab results. To take all of that and roll it up into why we wanted to change now that I was able to determine that the number of calls we received each day is linear to the number of patients we saw each day, it made sense to take as many phone calls as we can. With some research, I found we were missing over 25% of the incoming calls. I was astounded with that number.

### Client
What was the biggest cause of over 25% of inbound calls being missed? Was it abandonment from being on hold? Was it just human error or human apathy?

### Expert
It was both abandonment. We did two things before flu season hit last year, which hurt us a little bit. The biggest thing is we downsized. Traditionally, all of our clinics were staffed with two people at registration. In all clinics, except the two busiest, we downsized to one person at the front. We took what was effectively a two-person call center, cut it in half.

We then trained, like crazy, that our front desk staff, you pay attention to the person standing in front of you that's already in the clinic, not the person on the phone that's thinking about coming to the clinic. We trained to not have somebody at the desk not feeling good, staring at somebody on the phone, talking to somebody else not feeling good. In doing so, we ended up missing lots of calls. We then began evaluating the market.

Athena is our EMR. We went to the athena Thrive conference in October. We take a small team, and I always challenge everybody, "What is the reason you're going? Because if you're not going to come back with something, then don't go." We agreed as a group that we were going to come back with an AI voice solution. We went to and had appointments with every vendor that's in the athena Marketplace, if you're familiar with that.

There's something I think called Patient AI. I could look at their marketplace and get all the names. The one I know that stands out the most was Assort. We got further down the road with Assort than we did anybody else. The biggest reason for that is the majority of the players that we talked with in this space, their ROI to us, their value proposition to us, was reducing call center FTEs and getting them to understand that we didn't have a call center, and therefore, we've already sent home the people we can send home. We need to make AI more efficient to the people calling, not reduce FTE headcount.

I don't know if we just weren't talking with the right people at the right level of company, but it seems more challenging than it should have been to get some of these vendors to understand what our pain point was. Assort seemed to get that, but for lots of reasons, they were very aggressive, not necessarily in a bad way, but they were very aggressive to get our business. We have a colleague within the athena space who pulled me aside and said, "Look, I've got some friends that have this company. It's relatively new. They're trying to get into healthcare, where Assort grew up in healthcare, called Flip AI, and would you take a look at them?"

I didn't commit to anything with Assort at the athena conference and came back, and we started conversations with Flip and like them. They actually flew here to see us from across the country from their different places from California, I think, to Texas to somewhere else. They flew here to meet with us and really get a deep understanding of what we were trying to achieve.

We went with them and have been, very happy is too strong of a word, but we've been happy, and we continue to evolve. I was literally just reading an email from someone. We had a call today that got canceled, got moved to 9:00 A.M. tomorrow morning. I gave them a list of all the stuff I want to make sure we touched on, and they addressed a bunch of it already today.

I was just reading that email before I dialed into this call. They've been really good collaborative partners. I think they're priced right in the market. They have been willing because they want a footprint in healthcare, and we want a solution. They've been willing to listen to lots of ideas we've had, and we've been willing to do the same with them to really try and find the right combination of how do we best manage our phone volume?

I should also say why this is so critical. Based on our clinic volume and our employee count, we saw under 175,000 visits last year. If a phone call equals a visit and you're missing over 25%, that's quite a few patients we're missing. We have taken that down, we rolled it out in our billing center, and in two clinics. That went so well that we rolled it out into all of our clinics in our billing center, and we have taken our missed call rate from over 25% down to less than 10% in about eight weeks. It's working.

### Client
The big question I have for them tomorrow is they're good at reporting the number of calls that started and terminated with AI as the solution. What I don't know is how many of those were terminated with AI because somebody got angry, hung up the phone, versus somebody that was satisfied and hung up the phone. I need that data from them tomorrow. As we sit here tonight, I don't have that answer.

There's certainly going to be some percentage. In Mississippi, which is the least educated state, and there's just still a bunch of good old rednecks that aren't going to want to talk to a robot no matter how articulate it is. They're going to want to talk to a person. If we can continue to drive down the number of calls that we miss, if we can continue to drive up the number of calls where a solution is found with AI, whether that's scheduling an appointment, which you can ask, and Flip sends a link that allows you to put yourself right on the schedule. You never have to talk to a human, and next thing you know you're registered. All of those things now are possible.

You can request a text link that allows you to pay your bill without having to sign into a portal. They've been able to integrate a lot of the third-party platforms we have within the athena Marketplace. They've been able to integrate that into the Flip platform and then really help us try and explore ways to make those stronger and more robust every day. I'll take a breath, and you tell me if this is helpful or if you need more or less and see what I can answer for you.

### Client
Just to clarify, what's the relationship between Flip AI and Assort? Was Flip AI the predecessor to Assort?

### Expert
No, they're competitors.

### Client
They're competitors, okay. Assort was able to integrate a lot of third-party platforms within the athena Flip Marketplace. Is that just a coincidence?

### Expert
I think Assort has just been at it longer. Flip is, and I'll get an update on the interface tomorrow. We've got all the approvals, we've got resources assigned. Of the three marketplace vendors that are most important to us, they now are fully interfaced with two of them into athena, and a third one, which is actually athena, is the one I'm waiting for them to finish. That is on the path toward completion. If you look at it from 100,000, they're competitors.

### Client
Are you a customer of Flip AI as well, in addition to Assort?

### Expert
No, we only went with Flip. We did not go with Assort at the end of the day.

### Client
Got it. You only went with Flip AI.

### Expert
That's correct.

### Client
Got it. Sorry, I was a bit confused because your bio says that you are a current customer of Assort Health and the final decision maker in procuring Assort.

### Expert
That's not accurate or that's a typo or I fat fingered something. We were working with their founder, one of their founders, Jon Wang. I spent a lot of time with that guy. They didn't do anything to tell us they weren't the company to go with. This really was a colleague that I know and trust within athena saying, "Hey, this is a young company trying to break in. Would you just give them a few minutes." I did. We just really hit it off. They were hungry and willing to be flexible and teach us what they know and let us teach them what we knew and vice versa. To date, it's turned out to be, I think, advantageous for us.

### Client
Got it. More specifically in terms of why you decided against going with Assort Health, was it just they're newer in the space and less experienced? Did you conduct a POC where you evaluated both solutions alongside each other and Assort performed less competitively? Would just love to hear some more context on that.

### Expert
I have nothing against Jon or the Assort team. I think they're really good folks. What my sense, and I hate to do things based on gut feeling, but unless we maybe did a little more than we would typically do. In the grand scheme of urgent care or an athena, we're rounding here. We have, like I said, 13 clinics, under 175,000 visits a year. It's not a small number, but it's not the biggest in the planet. I do know where we have the best relationships, the best outcomes are where we have relationships at the highest level with the companies that we work with.

My sense was with Assort, Jon, one of the co-founders, was doing a great job selling it, but the second it was sold, we're going to get handed down 17 levels down the food chain to some support customer service person who doesn't have the same vigor or energy or concern about the success of our business. Where Flip really presented their platform and their need to get into healthcare as they really wanted, it's used way too often, but they really wanted a partner.

Together, my colleague and I just had a stronger, I don't know, not relationship because we just met everybody. We just had a stronger feeling that neither commitment was long term, neither commitment was so much money that if we made a mistake, we couldn't get out of it. We decided to give Flip a try. So far, I've been very happy.

### Client
Super helpful. On the flip side, they're mainly solving for your missed call rate. While you don't have an understanding of whether the deflection rate or the non-human intervention rate is due to frustration or actual resolution, have you heard anecdotally from customers about how the Flip AI solution has performed in practice?

### Expert
I don't want to act like we're completely blind to it. Every call is recorded. Every call is transcribed. We have access to a dashboard, and I've got someone on our team. There are two people that manage all the front desk staff across all of our clinics. One of those two people, his job once a week is to spend about three hours, spot checking 50 or 100 calls and then telling me why people are calling.

There are a fair number without question. The biggest reason people call is a question about a visit or an appointment. That was something, for example, to compare the two, Assort wanted to have open-ended questions. Flip was very adamant that they wanted very specific closed questions, yes or no, not why are you calling today when that makes the world your oyster.

When people call today, the very first question the Flip AI asks is, "Is your reason for calling today regarding a visit?" If 70% of the reason is for a visit, you've already answered that yes or no on the front end by identifying why someone's calling. Anyway, this person takes those transcripts and those recordings and listens. I don't even think it's 50/50. I think it's probably 70/30 of the AI result calls that are a positive resolution, not a negative resolution.

I think that for two reasons, our volume is going up patient-wise, and if a patient was dissatisfied, they're going to tell us at the front desk when they come in to register that "I talked to your robot, I made this appointment, and it was a miserable experience." We're not seeing that. We're not getting blown up on Facebook with that or Google or anything else.

Typically, when we screw up, people let us know. I don't want to be blindly ignorant to the fact that we might be pissing some people off. At the end of the day, I think we're satisfying more than we were before. I think I'd rather have someone at least get through and get some information and hang up than someone that calls and we never answer the phone. In my opinion, lesser of two evils.

### Client
Yeah. It's interesting that you adopted Flip because one key question that we're trying to answer is when you look at the healthcare opportunity and voice AI and intake, it's a huge opportunity. Will it be won by players that position themselves as purely healthcare vertical specialists or horizontal solutions that may have more mind share but may not solely specialize in healthcare? I'm looking at Flip. It looks like they're far more multi-vertical than that's purely healthcare. What's your long-term take on what type of player will be seen as the winner of this healthcare voice AI market, long-term player or a vertical player?

### Expert
It's the horizontal. It's the latter of the two you described. I'll give you an example. My brother-in-law is an attorney in his firm, and I have two daughters that are attorneys and one that's about to be attorney. Anyway, they all work for the same firm. They're the only three attorneys in the firm. I don't know if you're familiar with the lawsuits against J&J about talc being in Johnson's baby powder having a causational relationship with ovarian cancer.

My brother-in-law was the one that brought that first case and successfully after seven years got Johnson's baby powder taken off the market in the United States. They just filed a second huge class action suit against L'Oréal for hair dye causing bladder cancer in hairstylists, people that spend their day dyeing hair.

Within hours of that story running on MSNBC with some insane number of calls, like 30,000 calls went into their call center. I called my brother-in-law and told him I was going to introduce him to Flip because I think you could find an AI solution where you're not paying at this call center a fortune, you're paying an AI solution much less money to come up with that information. The short of all of that is Flip came back to me and said that that wasn't in their immediate roadmap but that's something that they're willing to look at in the future.

I think if all your eggs in one basket, you're much more limited. You can either explode in a good way or in a bad way, but either way, the opportunity to explode is too great. I think a linear path and I think the learnings around the AI piece of it I think would be greater with more diversity. I could be completely wrong. If I had to bet, that's the way I would bet today.

### Client
Yeah. I think on one hand, if a vertical player would win, it would be, one, due to branding and messaging, which would resonate with the end market, but not really product differentiation, or two, that a vertical player would just be further ahead in healthcare-specific integrations and typical use cases that can be automated than something horizontal.

It seems like Flip has done that on the healthcare side by being a horizontal first player. Do you think from a branding and visioning perspective, maybe less sophisticated practice owners than yourself would be more willing to adopt a vertical-based solution versus taking a more objective view of things and more rational view of things like you are?

### Expert
I have to say yes and no. I can't say there's not some truth to what you say, but my experience is the smaller the group, the older the decision makers, and I'm not trying to age anybody out because I'm not a spring chicken, but the harder it is for them to adopt technology. A solo practitioner at 62 years old that's got seven years left in his practice before he wraps it up and sells it, is he going to adopt AI to solve a phone problem? No, I don't think they are. The target is a phone system that's got a call center, that truly is looking at cost savings.

I think being vertically-focused only at healthcare as opposed to being linear, you limit yourself. At the end of the day, whether you're answering phones for a law firm or for TrustCare Health, it's AI answering a patient's call with a question about X. As long as you know how to manage the call about X, you're solving a problem. Does that make sense?

### Client
100%.

### Expert
Whether it's a dinner reservation, an airline reservation change, a hotel, a rental car, doctor's appointment, it's still a phone call with a human on the other end with a need. Can your AI solution satisfy that need more often than not with end-to-end solution versus human intervention? I just think if that's the lens you look through, then your market is exponentially greater if you're not just healthcare-focused.

### Client
How competitive would you say this overall market is based on your time at the athena Conference? Were there two or three vendors in this space that had a good amount of mind share where they're 10-15? We're just trying to get a sense of how crowded of a space this is or if Flip and Assort have genuine first mover advantages.

### Expert
I think there were probably five or six that had a meaningful story to tell. Now, the other side of this, and who knows what next year looks like. In a completely different segment of our business, we switched from Vendor A to another vendor for our patient engagement and upfront registration, which is all done with your smartphone.

Three years ago, at the Thrive Conference, there were maybe four vendors in that space. This past year at the Thrive Conference, there's 25 vendors in that space. I don't see AI solutions, whether it be through digital transcription of patient engagement. We use an AI platform now for when our providers see a patient, so their focus is on the patient and not focused on typing into a laptop.

I just see AI expansion throughout that whole model, whether it be on the engagement and intake, whether it be on the seeing a patient, whether it be paying your bill, scheduling an appointment, I just see that continuing to grow. There were only, like I said, half a dozen or so, but I would imagine next year, I wouldn't be surprised if it was twice that.

### Client
This is super helpful. Thank you so much for the time and congratulations on all of your success. Have a great day.
