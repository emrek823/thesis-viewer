### Company Background & Founding Team

- Pranav Garg: Former VC (healthcare software), MD Clarity operator, recent AI agent company operations lead
	- Moved to Bay Area 5 months ago to learn AI agent deployment
	- Met Rohan through mutual healthcare interests
- Rohan Dalvi: Ex-McKinsey consultant (payers/providers), AI logistics startup (Vuma) deployment function
	- Pranav’s mom worked at SNF, catalyzed their thinking
- Both non-technical, bringing on CTO within next couple months
- Using no-code tools (Lovable, Figma, Make) for early validation

### SNF Market Opportunity & Product Focus

- Target problem: SNFs rejecting high-acuity patients despite higher reimbursement potential
	- Root cause: Poor MDS (coding) execution leaving revenue on table
	- Current solutions inadequate:
		- In-house nurses: High quality but removes nurse from patient care
		- Virtual MDS nurses: Cheaper but lack clinical context
- Market sizing: 10-20% revenue optimization per MDS patient = $20B profit pool expansion opportunity
- Broader SNF tech stack extremely antiquated
	- Point Click Care virtual monopoly with poor UX
	- 700-field MDS forms with minimal support (1000-page manual)

### Strategic Vision & Expansion Paths

- Three potential company evolution routes:
- Defensibility through proprietary clinical rule set
	- Building COPD vs COPD with exacerbation detection logic
	- Capturing accept/reject data on recommendations to optimize rules over time
- Balancing SNF revenue maximization vs payer cost management long-term

### Next Steps

- Fundraising timeline: Late spring/early summer (June target)
- Two pre-raise milestones:
- Virtue to follow up in ~1 month on progress
- Requested: Introductions to forward-looking SNF partners for commercial validation
