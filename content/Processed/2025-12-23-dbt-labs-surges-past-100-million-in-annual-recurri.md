**PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 5, 2025** -- [dbt Labs](https://www.getdbt.com/ "dbt Labs"), the pioneer in analytics engineering, announced today that it has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), scaling from $2M ARR to this milestone in only four years. Simultaneously, the company has exceeded the 5,000 customer mark, with 85% year-over-year growth in adoption among Fortune 500 companies. This momentum is fueled by dbt’s critical role as the data control plane for enterprise data teams around the world, who rely on the technology to transform data into reliable, actionable business insights.

“When my cofounders and I created dbt eight years ago, we were addressing our own frustrations while working with data. In the process, we pioneered the modern practice of analytics engineering, the fusion of software engineering best practices with traditional analytics," said Tristan Handy, founder and CEO at dbt Labs. “It was what data teams needed, and it led us to both this milestone and the path forward for our data control plane. I’m grateful to the dbt Community, our customers, employees and partners for contributing to our progress, supporting our vision, and continuing to rely on dbt.”

dbt Labs’ vision for One dbt – a commitment to a single unified dbt experience, regardless of the persona, data platform, or cloud that an organization uses – demonstrates its resolve to deliver the experiences and capabilities users need to build, manage, govern, and maximize the impact of their crucial analytics workflows. This has generated strong demand for [dbt Cloud](https://www.getdbt.com/product/dbt-cloud "dbt Cloud"), the data control plane that supports users across every stage of the [Analytics Development Lifecycle](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4272622-1&h=545613714&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getdbt.com%2Fresources%2Fguides%2Fthe-analytics-development-lifecycle&a=%C2%A0Analytics+Development+Lifecycle "Analytics Development Lifecycle").

Through dbt Labs’ scalable technology, organizations are able to overcome major hurdles related to data quality, data velocity, and data governance, allowing them to move faster while having far more trust and confidence in their data. The company’s [recent acquisition of SDF Labs](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-labs-announces-sdf-labs-acquisition "recent acquisition of SDF Labs") also brings robust SQL comprehension into dbt, supercharging developer productivity, heightening data quality, and optimizing platform costs. These developments are critical as enterprises continue to launch AI projects, building demand for better data quality and carefully governed inputs.

In addition to its $100 million ARR milestone, dbt Labs also recently surpassed 5,000 dbt Cloud customers (30% year-over-year growth). The expanding list of organizations that rely on dbt include [Condé Nast](https://www.getdbt.com/case-studies/conde-nast "Condé Nast"), [Hubspot](https://www.getdbt.com/case-studies/hubspot "Hubspot"), [Nasdaq](https://www.getdbt.com/case-studies/nasdaq "Nasdaq"), and [Siemens](https://www.getdbt.com/case-studies/siemens "Siemens"). dbt Labs’ existing customer base is also investing heavily in the dbt Cloud platform, with 90% year-over-year growth among customers at or above the $100,000 ARR level. The company’s recent innovations, many announced during its [annual Coalesce event](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/ "annual Coalesce event"), have paved the way for this traction. Among these: [dbt Copilot](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/introducing-dbt-copilot "dbt Copilot"), a new [visual editing experience](https://www.getdbt.com/product/develop "visual editing experience") and [cross-platform dbt Mesh](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/introducing-cross-platform-dbt-mesh "cross-platform dbt Mesh").

“With dbt, we’ve empowered teams by providing the tools and techniques needed to take ownership of their data, which has led to faster workflows, improved data quality, and higher engagement across the board,” said Brian Lloyd-Newberry, AVP Architecture, [Cox Automotive](https://www.coxautoinc.com/ "Cox Automotive") Data Portfolio. “This shift has driven significant successes, enabling our teams to deliver greater value with confidence and precision.”

Sunny Pachunuri, Head of Data Engineering and Platform at [Endpoint](https://www.endpoint.com/ "Endpoint"), added: “dbt Cloud is the data control plane at the center of my organization’s data strategy. Since adopting dbt, we have increased our productivity by 75% and reduced costs by almost 80%, and are far more agile,” he said. “It has completely changed the way we create data products, ship them in the organization, and build trust with stakeholders. We are invested in growing our data strategy in step with dbt’s innovation roadmap.”

dbt Labs also continues to cultivate relationships with strategic industry partners including AWS, Databricks, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Snowflake, and Salesforce. In fact, the company recently announced [a new collaboration](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-labs-and-salesforce-announce-strategic-partnership "a new collaboration") to tightly integrate Salesforce Data Cloud AI automation and analytics solutions with dbt Cloud, enabling customers to maximize the collective potential of dbt, Salesforce and Tableau platforms. For these organizations and the hundreds of others in the dbt Labs partner ecosystem, close collaboration is critical to delivering the best experience to customers.

“At Slalom, we’re passionate about empowering organizations to unlock the full potential of their data, and dbt Labs has been an invaluable partner in that journey,” said Ryan Gifford, Managing Director of Data+AI at [Slalom](https://slalom.com "Slalom"). “Their innovation in analytics engineering has transformed how data teams operate, delivering the scalability and governance that modern enterprises need. We’re eager to continue working alongside dbt Labs to shape the future of our joint customers and partners, helping them achieve meaningful outcomes with their data.”

dbt Labs has also continued to expand its corporate footprint, with customers located in 43 countries (27% year-over-year growth) and new offices in Austin and Dublin. In addition, the company is concentrating expansion efforts in APAC. In-market employees in Japan are now joining dbt Labs teams in Australia and New Zealand to support the growing demand from the region’s customers and partners.

The industry is celebrating dbt Labs’ trajectory and impact, with the company recently being named to the [2024 Deloitte Technology Fast 500](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/fast500-winners.html "2024 Deloitte Technology Fast 500") list (based on revenue growth rate) for the third consecutive year. In addition, it has been named finalist in the inaugural [2025 Tech Innovation CUBEd Awards](https://www.thecube.net/awards "2025 Tech Innovation CUBEd Awards"), to be announced in February 2025.

“dbt Labs accelerates the time to value for data practitioners worldwide," said Matt Miller, venture partner at Sequoia Capital and dbt Labs Board of Directors member. “dbt simplifies the process of transforming and understanding complex sets of data. The product works across all the cloud data warehouses as a simplifying layer and brain of sorts. dbt is fueling new business analytics, AI models and the AI apps changing the world. Its future couldn't be brighter.”
