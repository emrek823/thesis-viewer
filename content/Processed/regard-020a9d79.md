## Slide 5: All existing "gap solutions" are out of touch...

Regard
All existing "gap solutions" are out of touch...

**Legacy Gap Insurance**
*   Same limit for all insureds regardless of their health plans' out-of-pocket cost risk
*   Requires human adjudication of Explanation of Benefits statements
*   Still relies on medical context, not cost

**Other Ancillary Insurance**
Critical illness, accident, hospital confinement, etc. are designed to pay accident/illness stipends and tie payouts not to cost burden but to medical encounter context

**HRAs**
*   High admin effort for employers
*   Low employer penetration
*   Put capital reserving onus on employers

**HSAs**
*   High admin effort for employers
*   Require high deductible health plans*
*   Put capital reserving onus on insureds

* Many plans with high-enough deductibles don't qualify as HDHPs, because they provide some minor benefits before the deductible is met

## Slide 8: How it works

◆Regard
How it works

1.  Employers enroll employees, as Gap insurance is usually fully employer-funded.
    Individuals coming through the retail channel enroll via retail agents or directly with us.
2.  We track each insured's medical out-of-pocket spend directly through their medical carrier.
3.  We piggyback on medical claims adjudication to determine reimbursable expenses.
4.  We algorithmically adjudicate claims, trigger claims payout flows, calculate commission
    payments to producers, and reconcile accounts payable.
