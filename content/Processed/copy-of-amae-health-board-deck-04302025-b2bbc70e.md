## Slide 4: General Company Tailwinds

2025 is off to a strong start with significant member growth, exceptional clinical quality, the launch of our relationship with Stanford, technology tool and strategy advancements, early RCM improvements, and investments in a strong team

### Perform

*   Increase in active members by **35% in Q1 2025**; meaningful progress with building and optimizing our patient acquisition function
*   Key Hires: Chief Strategy Officer, Rick Idemoto; Revenue Cycle Management Director, Jen Penquite
*   **Strong collaboration with New York Presbyterian.** NYP has been **extremely happy with the partnership** and is looking for us to keep expanding; they've also appreciated our technology platform (we have done 3 Palantir demos for them)
*   Signed definitive documents and launching **by far our largest partnership to date with Stanford Health Care**; launching 3 clinics in 2025, 3 in 2026, leveraging Stanford faculty and extremely high CA commercial rates
*   We are being perceived as high quality, **best-in-class SMI provider**, which has made sales into other AMC's meaningfully easier and more streamlined as we can use our partners (Cedars-Sinai, NYP, Stanford) as references
*   **Significant improvements in Raleigh Clinic ops and performance**, reaching projected positive gross profit in March ‘25 due to contracting & team changes
*   Conducted in-depth member experience interviews that were overwhelmingly positive, **NPS 80**
*   Corporate offsite in February, very strong team that is bought into Amae mission and executing well toward 2025 vision and plan

### Innovate

*   We are capitalizing on the Metabolic psychiatry trend, which is clinically immensely efficacious and in demand in patients. Presented preliminary results of our precision medicine and ketogenic study at Schizophrenia International Research Society. Applied for additional grant for 100 members
*   Built out numerous **technology tools including AI Transcription tool, Member-at-a-Glance, AI Therapist Bot**, other numerous Palantir functionality points
    *   Now summarizing visit notes, including focus treatment, with AI, 80% efficiency increase for psychiatry (~8 minute note to 3 minute note)
    *   Launching AmaeBetter (Patient Facing app which includes Fitbit + AI Therapist Bot + other tools), MVP coming in Q2

### Grow

*   **Strong growth in academic medical center pipeline**, including The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center, Novant Health, and Mass General Brigham
    *   Novant and OSU LOI/Term sheets are in review
*   New clinic locations in New York and SF Peninsula are in progress
*   Additional payor contracts signed across all markets Amae is currently operating in to further increase access and coverage
*   New service line expansion including TMS and Collaborative Care Management to increase revenue per member

## Slide 5: General Company Headwinds

We continue to feel the effects of key RCM & Finance vacancies, revenue has not increased proportionally with member growth, New York member attendance and engagement lags behind plan, and payor contract negotiations are often lengthy and cumbersome

### Perform

*   **New RCM leader in place, but significant infrastructure needs ahead before we see full results**
    *   Leveraging offshore firm, rocky start with work quality, closely auditing and monitoring
*   **Parted ways with Finance Director in Q1. Still running search for backfill**
    *   **Financial infrastructure behind plan**, including clear metrics, unit economics and accruals
    *   Leveraging contract labor to meet immediate needs
    *   Planning to launch relationship with firm for **accounting & FP&A (Countsy)** and seeking Strategic Finance hire for in-house
*   **Continuing to feel limitations of Clinic Director skill set**; teams require additional support managing capacity, productivity, and member engagement
    *   Actively hiring Practice Managers to launch dyad model in all clinics
*   **New York attendance and participation in services meaningfully below plan**, leading to low revenue per patient
    *   Strategic plan to increase engagement in services is underway, monitoring closely
    *   **Healthfirst reimbursement is significantly behind plan**
    *   **Fidelis contract stalled** (awaiting countersignature); rates are higher than existing Healthfirst contract
*   **Los Angeles saw a dip in attendance in January & February during fires.** Also decline in March when staffing was lower. Seeing early signs of recovery.

### Grow

*   North Carolina showing unit econ improvements but referrals are still lagging behind plan
    *   Targeting smaller organizations due to slow progress with health system partnerships
    *   In network with two payors; Alliance and BCBS. Aetna rate negotiations in progress but rates are lower than target
    *   Have tested PHP claims with Alliance and early signs of success, but not confirmed at scale.
*   **Increasing challenges with behavioral health contracting across payors**; lengthy and cumbersome contracting processes
    *   Industry standard; in addition to challenging year for insurers (shift to outcomes vs. access, changing regulatory environment)
*   **Cedars-Sinai leadership is invested in activating our referral partnership, but very slow moving**
    *   Blockers in Social Work team across units despite senior psychiatry leadership being aligned with Amae

**Comments:**

*   20% Patient Growth in Q1 from December, 12% MoM revenue growth in Q1
*   Fires in Los Angeles in January and early February impacted attendance and engagement, suppressing revenue
*   Improved cash collections with further improvements planned for Q2
*   Please see growth slides for patient detail -> new patients have increased meaningfully but we have also churned unengaged members

**Comments:**

*   Projected positive gross profit in March 2025! Due to change in reimbursement to PHP for Alliance
*   PHP contract with Alliance went live in March 10, BCBS live April 18
*   Significant turnaround efforts including team changes and new standards for engagement and attendance have dramatically increased service utilization by members
*   While total member volumes have stayed flat, we have significantly increased higher LTV members (intensive phase) and continued to do so in April. With our new PHP contracts, we can bill meaningfully higher amounts for them

| Maintenance | 4         | 9         | 13        | 13        |

**Comments:**

*   Patient growth remains strong and continues to validate the health system referral partnership approach
*   As patient utilization increases, cost would remain flat as we have a lot of providers that are not being utilized
*   Member engagement and attendance are behind plan and materially lower than other clinics, leading to low revenue per patient. We are implementing new processes to ameliorate this.
*   We continue to see delays and discrepancies with revenue collection from Healthfirst

## Slide 15: RCM & Credentialing Investments

We started rebuilding RCM in Q1, beginning with hiring our new Director, Jen Penquite

### Q1

**People**

**Wins**
Building out team with a mix of in-house and offshore resources
*   RCM analyst hired who will also support Credentialing
*   Access BPO (RCM vendor) relationship initiated
*   Open PM (billing and practice management software system contract signed and built)

**Challenges**
(1) Concern around Access (BPO) subject matter expertise and work quality; we are actively evaluating other vendors

**Process**

**Wins**

*   Insurance verification
*   Prior authorization
*   MFS payment plans
*   Coding / billing
*   AR / Denials Management
*   Statements / Collections
*   Provider on / offboarding

**Challenges**
(1) Increased complexity as we sign and onboard new payor contracts
(2) Our current processes are highly manual and detailed, will need to be automated in the future

### Q2

**Technology**

**Priorities**
Investing in our technology stack to better manage our function
*   Optimizing the connection between our EHR & Foundry
*   Building out RCM reporting suite
*   Automating dashboards for internal teams

**Key Takeaways**
*   50% growth in total members over first 4 months of 2025
*   Improved processes led to more qualified leads and conversions
*   Discharges increased as we standardized our definition, member relocation, or transition of care
*   Q4 was slightly inflated due to lower acuity intakes that did not convert or were discharged in Q1

## Slide 30: Quotes From Our Members

"I've made some great friends here that I hang out with frequently. Just being able to come together in a space with people who understand what you have been through is something very comforting. It's validating just seeing that you are not alone in this fight."

“I really do enjoy this space. It is unlike anything I've ever encountered in the world of therapy. I've been in two inpatient and one outpatient. And they've never been close to giving me the connectedness that Amae has brought me. This is my reason for getting out of bed."

“I'm very thankful for Amae. The staff really saved my life. They came to pick me up from the hospital. If I went home, I would have never came here. I'm very grateful for this place. Y'all really saved my life. I just can't say thank you enough."

    *   **Duration:** 00:16:45
*   **Transcription Text:**
    *   "And okay, great. So Kyle, what brings you in today? I recently broke up with a long, long-term partner. And it's been one of many breakups I've had in my life. And at this point, I'm getting older. I have gray hair. I feel like the clock is ticking. And I don't feel like I will ever find out somebody who loves me. I don't feel like, I feel like I would have found them already. I feel like I've dated enough people to make that happen and it's not happening and I don't see anything changing and my depression is through the roof because of it. Okay, so I'm sorry about your breakup and I'm sorry that that kind of led to a cascade of thoughts in your head about what this really means about your future for relationships and about you ultimately. So we're going to do a"
*   **Ask Your Question:**
    *   **Question:** what is kyle's biggest challenge?
