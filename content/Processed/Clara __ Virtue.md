### Current Business Status and Challenges

- Product is not 10x better - not truly differentiated
	- Bit better overall but not enough to move the needle for super quick growth
- Growth stalled recently due to operational capacity limitations
	- Vanessa maxed out at managing about 25 accounts
	- Can’t handle more business without additional hiring
- Got “unluckily lucky” in Dec/Jan with a few big acquisitions
	- Drove growth and gave positive view of very narrow niche
	- Not possible to replicate that pattern - hasn’t been super replicable after January
- Burn rate concerns:
	- Acquisition projections showed accelerating burn rate
	- Payroll costs would be too high to scale the current approach

### Key Learnings

- Caregiver relationships facilitated are stickier than benchmarks
	- Yield higher quality care in many cases when done right
- However, matching process is highly challenging
	- Expensive and difficult to get people into relationships upfront
	- Requires significant “pulling” on both marketplace sides
	- Family dynamics and caregiver personal lives create complexity
	- Human complexity difficult to manage affordably and reliably
- Competing against “ignorance of first-time consumer”
	- Consumers don’t yet know agencies will disappoint them
	- Agencies have initial go-to-market advantage

### Team’s Perspective on Next Steps

- Ian’s view:
	- Excited to take learnings and momentum in this space
	- Need to focus more narrowly - current breadth is too ambitious
	- Lean more into strengths in product engineering
	- Still excited about trying something related but different
	- Skeptical about acquisition potential with Papa
- Jon’s view:
	- Not burnt out, still excited about focusing on solvable problems
	- Interested in continuing Papa conversation for career development
	- Papa might value their regulatory/business model solution
	- Papa’s business has plateaued with insurance reimbursements
	- Papa wants to bid on ADL-required RFPs but can’t without becoming an agency

### Potential Next Direction

- Most likely outcome is winding down compliance and payroll pieces
	- Focus instead on caregiver quality, vetting, scheduling, and assignment
	- Direct employment piece has many issues, not attractive to customers
- Will require laying off 2-3 people
	- Need to handle transition of client tax accounts
	- Operations/compliance lead preparing transition report
	- Will take approximately 1-1.5 months to wrap up
- Team will start working on new direction simultaneously

### Sean’s Advice

- Supports team’s desire to continue with new experiments
	- “Go run at the stuff where it might be 5%, 10% likely that it works”
	- Efficiency gains/improvements won’t excite downstream investors
	- “Do the crazy shit right now”
- Shares examples of other portfolio companies that turned around
	- One went from life support to $20M in 12-18 months
	- Another about to land potential $100M revenue opportunity
- Encourages transparency about team’s commitment level
	- Fully supportive if they’re committed to fast experiments
	- Just be honest if they’re not
