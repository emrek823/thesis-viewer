- Majority of revenue from 4-5 high-volume accounts purchasing 24/7 live-in care (160 hours/week)

### Target Customer Personas

- High-touch clients generate significantly more revenue; charging 15% of payroll for 160 hours/week care

### Acquisition Strategy

- Updating strategy based on Q1 learnings to focus aggressively on high-value targets
- Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs):
	- Joined their industry group, pursuing event sponsorships, developing relationships with chapter leads
	- Already receiving referrals from first GCMs
	- Focus on GCMs in Q2 to get foot in the door with wealthy client community
- Exploring partnerships with insurance companies and hospital networks
- Aiming to generate word-of-mouth referrals within target demographic

### Operational Improvements

- Tactics:
	- AI across communication: Generating and editing responses, tracking quality improvements
	- Specific workflow improvements: Automating caregiver-coordinator matching process

- Torch (investor) feedback:
	- Pleased with progress, expecting need for seed extension

### Strategic Considerations
