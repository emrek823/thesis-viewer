## SOLSTICE MARKET SIZING ANALYSIS

We segmented our customers into three tiers based on the size of the organization and the number of locations that they have. Locations were determined based on the number of providers per location. Based on our experience working with our partner practices, there are on average five providers per location. Providers include physicians, advanced practice providers such as nurse practitioners, nurses, and medical assistants.
1.  Tier 1 or T1 (large community practice chains): 100+ providers
2.  Tier 2 or T2 (mid-sized multi-location practices): 6-100 providers
3.  Tier 3 or T3 (single-location practices): 1-5 providers

There are 199,989 total group physician practices in the US. To start, we will focus on T2 and T3 practices, given that their sales cycles are faster and that these practices principally rely on manual means of retrieving patient health information.
*   T2 has around 85K organizations (42.4% of total practices).
*   T3 has around 82K organizations (41.2% of total practices).

Our ARV is driven by the number of new and follow-up patients at each location. Based on our experience speaking to 30 practices of varying sizes (Ex: large: Florida Cancer Specialists; medium: Maryland Oncology Hematology; small: Comprehensive Cancer and Hematology Specialists), the average number of new patients and follow-up patients per location across all segments is 1,200 patients/year and 8,800 patients/year, respectively. Single location practices operate out of 1 location, mid-sized practices have on average 10 locations and large practices have on average 50 locations. For new patients, we plan on conservatively charging $15/patient for T3 customers with bulk pricing going down to $13/patient for T2 customers. For follow-up patients, we plan on charging $3.75/patient for T3 customers going down to $3.13/patient for T2 customers. Taking the product sum of price and average patient volume, we arrive at $51K and $42.5K in ARV per location for T3 and T2 customers, respectively. The total ARV per practice (taking into account the average number of locations) is $51k and $425k for T3 and T2 customers, respectively.

We conservatively estimate our costs to be around $0.75 per patient for both new and follow-up patients and across all segments as we develop proprietary connections to QHINs while moving away from enterprise LLMs. Gross profit per patient will be $3.50 and $4.35 per patient for T2 and T3 customers, respectively, or with 82% and 78% margins.

With our current product, our path to reaching 100M ARR will require us to penetrate 2.38% of T3 customers (1,961 practices) with an ARV per practice of roughly $51K or 0.28% of T2 customers (236 practices) with an ARV per practice of roughly $425K.
*   TAM for T2 customers: $29.7B
*   TAM for T3 customers: $3.6B

Similarly, our path to reaching 500M ARR will require us to penetrate 11.9% of T3 customers (9,804 practices) with an ARV/practice of roughly $51K or 1.39% of T2 customers (1,177 practices) with an ARV/practice of roughly 425K.
*   TAM for T2 customers: $29.7B
*   TAM for T3 customers: $3.6B

While the market for our initial product is sufficient to create a venture-scalable business, there are a variety of value-add services we will eventually layer on top of this core business to assist the provider workflow. As healthcare moves towards value based care, providers are reimbursed based on risk scores assigned to their patient related to their prior medical history. We will help providers calculate appropriate scores so they are reimbursed appropriately. Through this, we are further able to segment customers by the number of departments required to use Solstice (billing, quality improvement, clinical trials). In fact, information related to a patient's medical history including their comorbidities, prior diagnoses, and genetic markers are helpful in influencing hierarchical condition category (HCC) & risk score calculations, quality payment program (QPP) reimbursements, and clinical trial matching. Further dividing up these segments will allow us to penetrate T1 customers, thus serving a broader range of customers.
