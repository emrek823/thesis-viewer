## Prepared Remarks:

  

**Operator**

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Abby, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Veeva Systems fiscal 2025 fourth quarter and full-year results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Gunnar Hansen, director of investor relations. You may begin.

**Gunnar Hansen** -- *Senior Director, Investor Relations*

Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's fiscal 2025 fourth quarter and full-year earnings conference call for the quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you have had a chance to read them before the call.

Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our chief executive officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, strategy; and Brian Van Wagener, our chief financial officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies, and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties.

Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, March 5, 2025, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information.

Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website.

With that, thank you for joining us, and I'll turn the call over to Peter.

**Peter P. Gassner** -- *Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer*

Thank you, Gunnar, and welcome, everyone, to the call. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a great year for Veeva, with strength across the business and results above guidance. Total revenue in the quarter was $721 million, with non-GAAP operating income of $308 million. For the year, total revenue was $2.75 billion, and non-GAAP operating income was $1.15 billion.

This past year was a significant year for Veeva. We executed well and delivered significant innovations across all product areas and make great progress on our AI strategy. The year was also about looking forward. We set our 2030 revenue goal of $6 billion, which reflects the significant opportunity we have ahead, and we announced our planned expansion into new markets.

We'll now open up the call to your questions.

## Questions & Answers:

  

**Operator**

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is open.

**Joe Vruwink** -- *Analyst*

Hi. Great. Good afternoon. I guess, first, congrats on the top 20 customer that went out in with Veeva in clinical after you mentioned seeing these opportunities last quarter.

I wanted to ask, I think there's maybe a trend in the large pharma community to perhaps reduce procurement risk and consolidate around strategic vendors. Is that part of why these opportunities are now arising? And how do you generally think about large strategic transactions like this when thinking about what you might see in the upcoming year?

**Peter P. Gassner** -- *Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer*

Hi, Joe. This is Peter. I'll take that one. I think this is really about -- for this particular customer, this is really about speed just more efficient to make a combined decision for the full clinical platform in a better way to align their different clinical teams onto a shared goal and shared technology.

So, I didn't sense any risk avoidance in this particular case. And in general, for the top 20 pharma, they're more with us focusing on competitive advantage, speed, compliance, not really a risk avoidance. Also, there's some desire to somewhat standardize because they know in the clinical area, the more they standardize together it will make it easier for the clinical research sites they deal with. Now, I wouldn't draw any particular conclusion to other customers.

It is -- the one pattern would be we are getting more strategic with our customers as ours. We have more product solutions and more of our product solutions are proven. But each of the top 20 is going to take a different path. This is due to just where they are in their technology journey and also where they're at in their pipeline and the things they need to accomplish.

**Joe Vruwink** -- *Analyst*

OK. That's great, Peter. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask just on recent industry developments, even though I think recently, there was even some news overnight just now in terms of research funding.

But Veeva has always been kind of very thoughtful. I remember back when the IRA was approved, you were very early in addressing what drug price legislation might be in -- I guess, along those same lines, if there are changes to indirect research funding, how do you think about potential knock-on effects over time what customers might be thinking about and then how that ultimately impacts Veeva?

**Paul Shawah** -- *Executive Vice President, Commercial Strategy*

Yeah. Hey, Joe. It's Paul. And yeah, we're certainly paying attention to what's happening around research funding.

But I'll take your question maybe a little bit more broadly. There's certainly a lot that's happening, right? There's a lot of proposed changes across many different areas. We're seeing changes in the news daily about FDA or NIH or price negotiations. So, there's a whole lot going on.

It's early, right? It's a little bit early to predict exactly what the impact may or may not be. One thing I can tell you is our customers -- there's really no impact to our customer decision-making process so far. So, we're not really seeing any change there. We're going to have to see how things play out, particularly as it relates to the answers.

There's just a lot of factors that come into play. It's super early to predict. I guess maybe two things that I might point out for you, though, our Life Sciences is generally more resilient to economic cycles or potential changes that you're talking about because it's an adaptable industry. They're accustomed to these kinds of changes.

And then as it flows through to Veeva, our revenue tends to be more predictable, right? It's core systems. It's annual subscriptions. Projects may get delayed. But if there is disruption due to something like this, those projects typically come back.

So, it's early to give you a detailed assessment of what the impact looks like, but it's something we're keeping our eye on closely.

**Operator**

And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.

**Saket Kalia** -- *Analyst*

OK. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here.

Peter, maybe for you. I thought it was interesting in the prepared comments how you called out 17 of the top 20s using CTMS, which I think replicates some of the success that you've had with eTMF. As you think about the growing success with different parts of the Development Cloud, what of the products could that success in eTMF and CTMS maybe pull through as you think about sort of the next sort of product cycles here?

**Peter P. Gassner** -- *Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer*

Thanks, Saket. Yeah, that's very insightful of you to pull that out. The industry, the top 20 seem to be standardizing on our eTMF and CTMS. I think for good reasons.

These are innovative products that fit together. And if we step back, that was an innovation that Veeva created. These systems never got together before Veeva. It was a document system way over someplace else and that transactional system, someplace else.

The Veeva Vault platform enabled this transition, and I was there in the beginning when people sort of called us heritage, right? These things don't -- you cannot put peanut butter and jelly together. It's not going to be good, right? Now, it obviously enables a seamless flow. So, they are standardizing on that, and we have to keep up the good work and the customer success we can't rest on our laurels at all, and we're not so far. But your question is what can it lead to? That leads to the broader clinical suite and you saw that with one top 20, which is things like study training and Site Connect.

These are both major applications very deeply connected with the CTMS and eTMF payments module and we'll be doing further investments there. That payments product can become a suite of products for Veeva. And then that also leads into the clinical data management, the EDC, CDB, also these big new areas of RTSM, randomization, and trial supply management and also the eCOA, Electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment. Just to give a perspective, roughly speaking, I wouldn't hold a ruler up to this.

But roughly speaking, EDC is one of our larger product line areas, larger opportunities. But our RTSM is roughly equivalent to EDC. And eCOA on its own roughly equivalent to EDC, so these are not small areas, big areas. Clinical is roughly one-third of our opportunity, our TAM because it's such an important area.

And there's a long way to go and eTMF and CTMS success, not just selling the product in, but the success and the fact that our implementations are getting faster and faster, our implementations now are faster than they were before. And that's really what people are looking off into Veeva. And I know, I'm going a little long on this, but that's an insightful question. Sometimes the question is I'm going to go to Veeva, but how can I get there the fastest and the most economically and the most accurately? And we're much better at that than we were two or three or four years ago.

**Saket Kalia** -- *Analyst*

It makes a ton of sense. Brian, maybe for my follow-up for you, just building off of what Peter talked through. I was wondering if you could just touch on CDMS or EDC. I was wondering if you could just touch on how that's contributing to billings in fiscal 2026.

You had some big top 20 wins in EDC a couple of years ago. And if I recall correctly, those are ramping contracts. How do you think about that contribution in fiscal 2026? And maybe the corollary that since we're at the end of year and to make sure the question is asked, as you build scale in that EDC business, is there anything that -- is there a finer point that you could give us just on relative size of that business?

**Brian Van Wagener** -- *Chief Financial Officer*

Hi, Saket. Thanks for the question. So, as you just heard Peter speak to, about one-third of our overall TAM is in the clinical space. So, it's certainly a large opportunity.

And within that, EDC is a pretty significant component. We're very pleased that in the quarter, we had our ninth of the top 20 committed EDC and we've had a steady advancement in EDC with top 20. So, from a ramp perspective, there are ramps that are steadily contributing to our revenue base, both to billings and to revenue, and ramps are not limited to EDC. So, we see that dynamic with top 20 customers in, really, all of our R&D products.

So, there's no one product, no one customer, no one year where that really spikes, but it's factor into our guidance for FY 2026.

**Operator**

And your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.

**Brent Bracelin** -- *Analyst*

Thank you for taking the question here. Peter, great to see the momentum. Great to hear the peanut butter-and-jelly narrative is actually starting to work. I wanted to drill down into Data Cloud.

You really brought up the point in the prepared remarks that Compass represents the biggest single data opportunity for you. You got over 100 brands here. I think a year ago, nine months ago, you talked about your first seven-figure customer. What's the momentum you're seeing on the expand side? Are you seeing larger seven-figure deals? I asked because, obviously, a lot of those Compass customers can start small, but would love to get any color you had on larger transactions, any expansion opportunities you're seeing.

Thanks.

**Peter P. Gassner** -- *Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer*

Yeah. For Compass, and if I go up one level to Data Cloud, I think that's probably the biggest change I've seen in the last six months in terms of tone is more interest in cloud overall. Now, that doesn't translate into deals or revenue right away, but we've organized internally a little bit more around Data Cloud, which is -- that's Compass, that's OpenData, that's Link, and that's Pulse, a new product we just announced. So, I think that -- we're getting that vision out there, and I think starting to resonate.

That like going back to eTMF and CTMS back in 2018. That's the way I feel that. People are starting to get the glimmer of, OK, that might really work. Now, in terms of Compass, most of our progress in Compass is on -- we have two main products there, Compass Patient and Compass Prescriber, most of our progress in revenue and our earlier product is in the Compass Patient.

And no, we haven't seen, really, a trend to
