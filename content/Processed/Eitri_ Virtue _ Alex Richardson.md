### Alex Richardson’s Background

- Penn neuroscience/engineering background
- Data science experience:
	- Hospitals (Sloan Kettering, UCLA)
	- Genentech (5 years) - transformed ETL pipelines from clinics to receivers (payers, FDA)
	- Exposure to manufacturing through lab reports and quality control data
- Recent work history:
	- Palantir (4.5 months) - healthcare commercial team
	- Left due to ethical differences - algorithms not supporting patient wellbeing
	- Currently at Foxtrot - deploying software for data engineering
- Just completed MBA a couple months ago
- Has extensive network in pharma:
	- Many connections at Roche
	- Former colleagues now at Gilead and other Peninsula biotechs

### Discussions about Eitri Role

- Role alignment discrepancy:
	- Alex was seeking technical product management position
	- Quinn wants someone focused on code/development full-time initially
	- Alex now comfortable with development focus for first 1.5-2 years before transitioning to oversight/business strategy role
- Technical assessment of project:
	- Feels the concept aligns with his experience
	- Hasn’t seen code or screenshots yet but understands general approach
	- Product ingests manufacturer data and uses LLM with high confidence outputs
	- Has been deploying AI full-time for a year
- Personal values alignment:
	- Values healthcare work: “I sleep better at night because I’m working in healthcare”
	- Personal connection to oncology (lost two grandparents to cancer)
	- Views healthcare and space travel as key forces “bringing humanity forward”
	- Motivated by making medicines more accessible and easier to develop

### Strategic Insights on Biomanufacturing

- Recognizes growth opportunity in smaller biotechs:
	- Companies with first funding often “have no idea what they’re doing”
	- Significant losses from “missing the mark and missing the paperwork”
	- Legacy systems problems: PDFs, handwritten notes comparable to “nurses writing schedules on a whiteboard”
- Identifies market challenges:
	- Many companies outsourcing to China with variable quality control
	- Scaling challenges represent clear selling opportunity
- Strategic approach:
	- Start with smaller biotechs to demonstrate value and collect evidence
	- Later approach larger pharma with proven solutions rather than just “cheap pilots”
	- That and space travel are his passion areas
