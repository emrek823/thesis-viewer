Fundraising prep meeting

Clara is Deel / Rippling for Home care - workforce management

We had front loaded the development of core payroll platform

The way we can acquire and drive majority of demand - the facilitation of high-quality care

Facilitating core payroll - they are satisfied with the analysis

Diversify and add new revenue streams

Everything from capture from float on payroll, tax withholds, EWA, monetizing insurance policies, montezing international remittances

Selling into this audience

Next 90 days - where are you being pulled

Our focus is still on continuing to get that marketplace spinning

Feature development - tax exemption in payroll

Marketplace matching is very manual

Workforce management

I don’t think that there are perfect parallels because of the demand gen

We need to create the market and capture it - they aren’t enough people looking to hire independently on the books and onboard organizations onto the fintech platform

We need to create the space - educate people effectively

Demand gen - differentiate

Do you have to be a marketplace? Hypothesis

We don’t want to be a marketplace

Effective way to acquire customers - it may not be the most efficient way to do it

If we want to double down and explore -

I’m skeptical that we would find a silver bullet

Referral strategy over next 90 days

We need to be able to do a couple things

Go broader

More systematically follow-up to drive volume through the platform

Track the value of those referrals - what are they giving to us

Marketplace matching and ops oriented / sales and referral marketing agencies

Unfortunately - closing these sales is squishy

SF - 90 days

Social workers at smaller places to go into social department -

Long-term play

Build momentum, start small

Referral - creative ideas for ways to avoid the grueling hand-to-hand combat

Fintech - is part of the pitch and that’s resonating with assisted living. We hate that they are paying cash we have uninsured caregivers running around our facility

Business - we’re now 60-90 days

I am really excited by the 3 things

Word of mouth referral

Institutional referral - skilled agency

Go-live with this portal

Those are all the first hints that the lower CAC flywheel is getting started - lighting money on fire

Hand to hand combat

There’s a world where this referral portal - 100%

Referral portal as example as what’s different now - we can give this away for free

That ultimately leads to high caregiver churn from these agencies - they can’t provide reliable hours and schedules

Longer term I’m bearish on becoming a better agency

One of the other things we’ve learned - we know tech better than our competition - the level of personal attention and manual operation hours, match, maintain their schedules on an ongoing basis. There was no way to automate that - it is possible

We’ve been playing around with some tools - longer term

Work like an agency to create demand - make this closer and closer that is direct facilitation of

While we may be fighting for referrals - complete that agency style service

End-state of marketplace

Demand-gen on caregiver side and seeking second caregiver

Demo Day + Strategy

Haven’t hit PMF - we’ve been running a lean ship. $1.25m in the bank. We are concerned about dilution

$500K at this point which we think will get us sufficient cushion to grow the team, business and hit $1m arr

Valuation we were discussing - $500K at $15m post. Dalton

How much do you really need? How sad would you be? We have $1.25m in the bank - we don’t need to run into that 500 cushion

Dilution - in ways that are overriding a potential couple million bucks

He’s still there - he’s going to raise at a lower valuation with next couple million

Deel / Rippling for home care

Why have others failed?

Capital / runway is not

PMF - When you have the money you spend it

Extends

Looped in on that strategy

<$5m bucks

Dilution -

Levels of gradation here

1 request - chat with the YC founder. I wished I raised more - would love to get his perspective

Dilution

YC has their own incentives - very adamant. Their recommendations
