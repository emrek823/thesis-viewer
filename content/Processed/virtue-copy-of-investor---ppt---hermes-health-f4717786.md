## Slide 9: The Problem: High Overhead to Request Records

# The Problem: High Overhead to Request Records

The Many to Many Network leads Requestors to suffer from:

*   **High Overhead:** Requestors have to physically call and fax, providers to obtain medical records
*   **Poor Tracking & Disjointed Platforms:** Requestors use multiple platform to submit records which means information is scattered across systems, leading to poor tracking
*   **Slow Turn Around Times:** 45 to 60 days turnaround time
*   **Providers Overcharge:** Providers frequently overcharge Requestors due to overestimated fees, and verifying is costly
*   **Stringent Compliance Requirements:** Systems and processes must continuously adapt to evolving security and regulatory standards

**Current Medical Record Process**

## Slide 10: Market Structure: Many to Many Network

# Market Structure: Many to Many Network

Medical Record Retrieval is slow, expensive, and cumbersome.

*   Many to Many Relationships Network
    *   100,000 Requestors
    *   61,000 Hospitals and Clinics ¹ ²
*   Requestors manually call and fax hospitals to obtain medical records.
*   Limited technology or integrations—processes rely entirely on human effort

*(Diagram depicts a "Many to Many" network where multiple "Requester" nodes are connected individually to multiple "Clinic" and "Hospital" nodes, illustrating a complex, non-centralized system.)*

## Slide 13: First Market: Mass Tort

# First Market: Mass Tort

**Mass Tort**

*   A mass tort involves individuals harmed by the same product or event, combining their lawsuits to streamline litigation while maintaining individual compensation based on specific injuries.

**Problem & Solution**

*   **Problem:** Mass Tort firms currently rely on paralegals to request and receive medical records to help their plaintiffs prove their injury to the case.
    *   High Overhead
    *   Inefficient use of time
*   **Solution:** Mass Tort companies use the Hermes Health Unity Platform to request and receive medical records
    *   Reduces administrative burden
    *   Reduces their overhead costs
    *   Improve turnaround times of records

**Market Size**

*   1,000,000 record requests per year around a $75M market
*   Link to Active Mass Torts Cases

## Slide 14: Example Mass Case: Depo-Provera

# Example Mass Case: Depo-Provera

**Overview**

*   Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive by Pfizer,
*   Faces mass litigation alleging failure to warn about increased risk of meningioma (brain tumors).

**Nature of Claims**

*   Plaintiffs claim Pfizer knew or should have known about tumor risks but did not adequately warn users.
*   Studies show prolonged Depo-Provera use linked to a **5.5-fold higher risk** of developing meningiomas.

**Potential Settlement & Payouts**

*   Estimated that there are several thousand claimants
*   Estimated individual payouts range from **$275,000 to over $1 million**, depending on severity.
*   Total potential settlement could be **$100M to $1 billion**

**Current Status**

*   Litigation is active; no global settlement reached yet.

## Slide 17: The Real Market Structure

# The Real Market Structure

**The Real Market Structure**

*   **Hospitals / Clinics:** Generate the data
*   **EHR Vendors:** Hold the medical records
*   **Release of Information Vendors (ROI):** Handle medical record release on behalf of hospitals and clinics

**Key Insight**

*   EHR and ROI Vendors have access to medical records
*   Therefore EHR and ROI Vendors can be used as gateways to medical records

*(Diagram shows multiple "Requester" nodes connected to a central "ROI Vendor" node. The "ROI Vendor" node is then connected to "EHR System", "Imaging", and "Claims" nodes. Below these, "EHR System" is connected to "Clinic" and "Hospital", while "Claims" is connected to "Payers".)*

## Slide 18: Solution: Create a Many to Few Network

# Solution: Create a Many to Few Network

**Partner with ROI and EHR Vendors**

Digitally Integrate and Partner with ROI and EHR Vendors to create a many to few network, and build a Requestor focused UI on top.

*   **Abstract the Complexity:** Integrate with ROI and EHR Vendors to create a simple layer to request and receive records.
*   **Reduce Overhead:** Automate the submission and delivery of medical records cutting administrative expenses.
*   **Faster Turnaround:** Reduce delays in record retrieval.
*   **Enabled Centralized Analytics:** Streamline data tracking and reporting

*(Diagram illustrates multiple "Requester" nodes all connected to a central "Hermes Health" node. "Hermes Health" is connected to an "ROI Vendor" and directly to two "EHR System" nodes. The "ROI Vendor" is also connected to an "EHR System". The "EHR System" nodes are shown connected to "Clinic" and "Hospital" nodes.)*

## Slide 20: Network Effects and Moats

# Network Effects and Moats

**Two-Sided Marketplace**

Hermes Health connects Requestors with Vendors creating value for both sides:

*   **ROI and EHR Vendors Benefit Via:**
    *   Increased Requests from Requestors increases Vendors revenue.
    *   Reduced fulfillment costs by switching Requestors to electronic submission and delivery
*   **Requestors Benefit Via:**
    *   Simplified record submission and delivery increasing, enabling increased demand for more requests
    *   Improved turnaround times

*(Flywheel Effect Diagram)*
The diagram shows a circular flow:
1.  **More Requestors** (leads to)
2.  **More Record Volume** (leads to)
3.  **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume** (leads to)
4.  **Faster and Easier Records** (leads to)
5.  Back to **More Requestors**

The central hub of this flywheel is **Hermes Health**.

## Slide 30: Hermes Health + ROI Vendors = Win Win

# Hermes Health + ROI Vendors = Win Win

**ROI Vendors Dynamics**

*   **Highly Fragmented:** The largest vendor holds only 20% market share.
*   **Lack of Trust:** Competition makes it difficult for vendors to collaborate to the benefit of requestors.
*   **Lack of Pricing Control:** With few direct deals with end customers, ROI vendors must operate under state-mandated pricing regulations.
*   **People-Driven, Not Tech-Driven** – Their core business relies on manual processes, making technology adoption difficult.

**Hermes Health Value to ROI Vendors**

*   **More Revenue:** Higher request volume driven by a better requestor experience.
*   **Technology Adoption / Lower Costs:** Shifts Requestors to API-based delivery and intake, reducing processing costs.
*   **Improved Collections:** Hermes Health makes direct deals with Requestors and pre-pays ROI vendors, enhancing cash flow and pricing control.
*   **Trusted Intermediary:** Hermes Health provides a neutral platform to integrate without exposing trade secrets to competitors.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Subsidized and simplified API implementation.

## Slide 32: Provider Fees

# Provider Fees

**Providers Charge**

*   Provider fees are fees charged by the provider to retrieve the Record.
    *   Rates are limited by federal and state regulations
*   Provider fees are in addition to the fees to Request a Record.
*   Hermes Health passes through Provider fees back to its clients

**Opportunity**

*   Hermes Health will negotiate bulk pricing with hospital systems, EHRs, and ROI vendors that averages the cost of Provider fees
*   This allows Hermes Health to offer flat fee pricing back to its customers reducing pricing volatility and de-risking project costs for clients
*   Hermes Health can then take the margin (the difference between average costs and the flat fee cost).

**Table: Provider Fees**

| Provider Fees | Percent of Times Charged | Fees Per Chart |
| :------------ | :----------------------- | :------------- |
| Hospital      | 20%                      | $100           |
| ROI Vendor    | 100%                     | $50            |
| EHR Vendor    | 100%                     | $10            |

**Table: Opportunity (Pricing Model)**

| Product             | Unhedged    | Hedged |
| :------------------ | :---------- | :----- |
| Record Request Fees | $50         | $50    |
| Provider Fees       | $0 to $500  | $50    |
| **Total**           | **$50 to $500** | **$100** |
