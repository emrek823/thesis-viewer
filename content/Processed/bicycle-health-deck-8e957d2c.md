Digital Opioid Dependence Treatment

## Slide 2: How does one become dependent?

Meet Lisa!

*   She started having body aches (back pain) after lifting a heavy crate at work. Also has emotional trauma (abusive ex husband).
*   Was prescribed opioids to take as needed.
*   As needed use, turned into daily use (dependence). She built tolerance and needed more.
*   When her doctor refused to increase her dose, she started buying pills from the street.
*   Traditional outpatient care doesn't fit into her life. Doesn't need inpatient.
*   In treatment with us for 5 months now. Pain is under control. Moved into her own apartment. Happy.

**Why seek treatment?**
To regain control of lifestyle, reduce brain fog, increase monthly savings, and return to a productive lifestyle.

## Slide 3: Big Problem

Opioid Dependence is widespread and underdiagnosed

**Venn Diagram Data:**

*   **Opioid Users:** 92 Million
    *   *Description:* At Risk Patients, At least 1 Opioid Rx / year
*   **Opioid Dependents:** ~15 Million
    *   *Description:* Physically Reliant patients, Rx for +75% of the year
*   **Opioid Addicts:** ~2 Million
    *   *Description:* Diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder, Based on DSM 5 Criteria

## Slide 4: The Opioid Epidemic is a long-term problem

| Column 1 (Problem)                                                                 | Column 2 (Pressure)                                                                       | Column 3 (Consequence)                                                                  |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| After initial 30 day Rx, 35% chance of continuing to take Opioids for 1+ years.    | Increasing pressure from Federal and State legislation to cut down Opioid Rx.             | Lack of access to treatment contributes to episodic, costly care.                         |
| `(Downward Arrow)`                                                                 | `(Downward Arrow)`                                                                        | `(Downward Arrow)`                                                                        |
| **`Box 1`**<br> ~15M Opioid Dependent users in the US.                             | **`Box 2`**<br> Dependents turn to synthetics or heroin to supplement Rx.                 | **`Box 3`**<br> 5X cost of care for Opioid Dependents.                                    |

**Vision**
Democratize access to Opioid Dependence Treatment so patients can easily and effectively manage their chronic disease and reduce total cost of care.

## Slide 5: Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) works, highly underutilized

**MAT = Medication Assisted Treatment**
*   **Anti-craving medication** (Buprenorphine)
*   **Support from others in recovery** (Peer Groups)
*   **Behavioral health treatment** (Counseling, Therapy)

*   **Saves Lives:** 50%+ reduction in all cause mortality.
*   **Chronic:** Patients remain in treatment for as long as needed.
*   **Tele-MAT works:** As well as in-person MAT, as shown by several studies.
*   **Highly underutilized:** 90% of people with OUD don't get MAT.
*   **Credibly backed:** Promoted by all major health organizations.

**Logos:**
*   AMA (AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION)
*   NIH (National Institute on Drug Abuse)
*   ASAM (AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE)
*   CDC (CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION)
*   World Health Organization

## Slide 6: Our Solution

## Slide 7: We go beyond MAT

A suite of evidence-based protocols to help high opioid utilizers decrease their opioid use or get off opioids altogether.

| An expert, licensed physician will perform an assessment and prescribe Buprenorphine/Naloxone (Suboxone) if appropriate. This will help you with cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Over time, our physicians can help you get off Suboxone by slowly tapering it down. | If you are not ready to quit taking opioids yet, our expert physicians can help you taper down your opioid use. We will create a taper schedule to decrease your dosage a little bit every few months. We ensure that your pain is managed and that you don't experience any withdrawals. | Throughout your treatment, a Health Coach will be your partner, mentor, spiritual guide, and support system to help you adjust to a new lifestyle. Through constant communication, your Health Coach will help you work through any challenges you face as you make strides toward your life goals. |
