### Deck Review Feedback

- Vision slide (slide 3) needs complete overhaul
	- Currently just word vomit, not actual vision
	- Requires crystal clear messaging
- Slides 2-4 need cleanup and consolidation
	- Look scattered and mashup-like
	- Should be max 1-2 slides from these three
- Solution slide (7) should lead, slide 6 feels like appendix
	- Timeline element in slide 6 throwing off messaging
	- Series A context misplaced for current stage

### Deck Structure Issues

- Poor ordering throughout
	- Model on slide 8, then “why now” revisited on slide 9
	- Traction buried until slide 10 (should lead)
- Claude AI reordering suggestions much better than current structure
- Need aesthetic improvements beyond black/gray/white theme
	- Add minimal color elements
	- Reduce verbose language throughout

### Key Technical Feedback

- $15M math issue needs verification
- Expansion-only growth model won’t work alone
	- Need realistic new customer acquisition strategy
- Team slide improvements needed
	- Lead with strengths, remove self-deprecating comments
	- Avoid oversimplification

### AI-Assisted Process

- Combined manual review with Claude analysis
- Claude output significantly better quality
- Created comprehensive reordering with rationale
- Developed systematic feedback consolidation approach

### Next Steps

- Send consolidated feedback document to Solstice team
- Include reordered deck structure with key improvement points
- Request updated version incorporating all feedback
- Share analysis with Byron for additional investor perspective
