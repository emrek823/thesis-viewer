### Company Overview - Tenix Health

- Will Detwiler, founder from Brooklyn/Georgetown background
	- Former Zoom M&A/corporate ventures (June 2020)
	- 4 years at Insight Partners (Series A/B, AI applications focus)
	- Co-founder Colin from Epic (Kaboodle analytics) + Indeed, putting in notice Monday
- Healthcare financial data integration platform
	- Clinical + operational + financial data currently siloed
	- Finance analysts spend first week of month manually crosswalking CSVs in Excel
	- Target: CFO/FP&A teams for reporting and margin analysis at code level

### Product Evolution & Current Focus

- Started with procurement marketplace concept (June)
	- Pivoted due to distributor oligopoly integration challenges
- Moved to preference cards for supplies/inventory
	- Realized missing half of P&L statement
- Current approach: AI analyst + semantic search + configuration layer
	- Rewrite preference cards to include cost + revenue = P&L by code
	- Drill down capability by payer, physician, supplier
	- Workflow alerts/notifications to ops teams

### Market Position & Competition

- Competitive landscape includes Midstream, Translucent, Clarium
	- “Like if Midstream, Translucent and Clarium had a baby”
	- Translucent just raised Series A (NEA, FPV involved)
	- Market timing appears favorable - “fertile window of opportunity”
- Differentiation: Granular code-level reporting with actionable workflows
	- Focus on traceability and cost allocation logic transparency
	- Bridge between financial results and operational changes

### Business Model & Go-to-Market

- Initial wedge: Reporting tool via semantic search to CFO
	- Fast time to value, clear buyer, opens aperture for additional use cases
- Target segments: Health systems (design partners) + mid-market (pilot partnerships)
	- Outpatient care (CPT codes) easier technically, less variability
	- Inpatient care (DRG codes) higher complexity but bigger opportunity
- Sales approach: “Blunt force trauma” - regional HFMA events weekly for lead generation

### Funding & Timeline

- Incorporating in next few days, off-site planning last week of January
- Funding timeline: Late February/March timeframe
	- Looking at $2M range for configuration/deployment hiring
	- Colin capable of initial product, need forward deployed engineers for scale
- Key hires needed: Forward deployed engineers, founding AE eventually
- Advisor strategy: Enterprise advisors (fundraising) + commercial advisors (CFOs)

### Next Steps

- Will: Off-site with Colin (Jan 28-30), then customer development sprint
- Virtue: Follow-up call early next week for deeper dive
- Introduction to Jack at Translucent for market intelligence
- In-person meeting opportunity Jan 20-30 or early February
- Will pursuing JP Morgan AI head as advisor
