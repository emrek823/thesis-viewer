**Claude Code, Hyperstructures and What Comes Next**

This winter break, much like many people, I've been obsessed with Al Coding.

To give some context, *last* winter break I challenged myself to build something by writing zero code. It was a mess, but once I held the Al the right way, it was like looking at the new world through a keyhole. I built a few cool things, including redoing my personal site at justjake.me. Nothing crazy, but it worked! Last year, I didn't write a single line of code by hand (mostly because I was running Railway).

This winter break, I tried my experiment again in earnest. This time, instead of holding it just right, I couldn't hold it incorrectly.

Claude and Opus constructed every problem I though deeply difficult. If I could clearly express it, and it made sense, it was as good as done.

I think programming as we know it is dead, and that's a good thing. I think creation, as we haven't known for a great many years, is more alive than ever.

If you live in San Francisco, you know the Golden Gate bridge. It stands in awe; how the fuck did we build something so BIG?

I'm going to start calling these things "hyperstructures"; a building so large, that you're really not certain how it got built, implementation-wise. The SpaceX rockets, the Cologne Cathedral; these are all hyperstructures.

I wrote recently that I think that the "last job" for Humans is structure seeking. I actually think that's myopic. Because we don't care about the implementation, entirely *new* structures are open to us. Massive, physics defying amalgams, but also hyperspeed jumps to new/odd places.

So our use of Al is going to push us humans towards designing not just structures, but *hyperstructures*

New ways to organize creation (code/simulation), organize humans (political), organize labor (economic).

And then, it is my belief, that we going to use these hyperstructures, which will expand inside virtual space, to build *backwards* to the physical world.

Or, we're going to get sucked into "The Inward Draw of Capitalism" (You can google my essay on this, I think X will penalize the post otherwise).

I believe this is our greatest burden/purpose for anybody who exists in this lifetime

A special nod to Jacob Horne, who probably doesn't know me, but put me onto the idea of Hyperstructures through this essay.

cool thinking. but as a big hyperstructures fan, I think you do the term a great disservice by condensing the complexity of the concept into just "bigness" as you have here

the original definition is really useful:

I don't mean to do it a disservice; I mean to compress it for the layperson

I think they're a bit tougher to grasp outside of the crypto sphere, so I have omitted them

(I agree wholeheartedly with those principles though BTW)

How do you view railway differently as a structure vs a hyperstructure

hold my beer

man we woulda had so much fun if i actually had a resume when we spoke
alas, it was all meant to be.

i think you'll enjoy what will be coming soon to hyperneighborhood near you
